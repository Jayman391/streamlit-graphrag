    "abstract": "This prospective, randomized, single-center, open-label pilot study evaluated the safety and efficacy in carotid surgery of a single intraoperative bolus of body weight-adjusted enoxaparin compared with unfractionated heparin.\nSymptomatic and asymptomatic patients with high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis were included. The primary objective was to evaluate perioperative efficacy (incidence of thromboembolic ischemic stroke). The secondary objective was to evaluate safety, including avoidance of hematoma at the site of surgery, gastrointestinal bleeding, rate of blood transfusions, and occurrence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.\nFrom July 2005 to June 2006, 338 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were enrolled; of these, 115 patients did not fulfill inclusion criteria, and 63 patients refused to participate. The remaining 160 patients were assigned in a 3:1 randomization to receive enoxaparin (0.5 mg/kg) or unfractionated heparin (5000 IU) intraoperatively as an intravenous bolus (120 and 40 patients, respectively). The mean patient age was 70.3 years (range, 43.3-94.7 years), and 54 were women. Internal carotid artery stenosis was asymptomatic in 55% and symptomatic in 45%. The difference in baseline characteristics between these groups was not significant. The rate of cerebral embolic events was 0.8% in the enoxaparin group (n = 1) and 2.5% in the unfractionated heparin group (n = 1). The rate of severe bleeding complications was 1.7% in the enoxaparin group (n = 2) and 5% in the unfractionated heparin group (n = 2; P > .05). No case of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was observed.\nThis pilot study found no difference between enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin during carotid endarterectomy in perioperative bleeding or embolic events. A large multicenter trial seems to be warranted.",

    "abstract": "Previous reports indicate that the prevalence and severity of carotid stenoses is greater in peripheral artery disease (PAD) than in coronary artery disease (CAD). To date, no study has compared these two populations with respect to plaque echogenicity, which is an independent risk factor for cerebrovascular events.\nIn 43 PAD patients without CAD and in 43 CAD patients without PAD, carotid plaques were studied with high-resolution B-mode ultrasound and by computerized measurement of the gray-scale median.\nAt visual analysis, the prevalence of hypoechoic plaques was 39.5% in PAD and 18.6% in CAD (P = .033). The corresponding values for gray-scale median analysis were 34.9% and 14.0% (P = .024). At multivariate analysis, PAD patients showed a greater risk of having hypoechoic plaques than CAD patients at visual (odds ratio [OR], 4.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-15.92, P = .025) and gray-scale median analysis (OR, 5.13; 95% CI, 1.27-20.67; P = .021). This association was no longer significant when neutrophil number was included among the covariates. In this model, only an increased neutrophil count was associated with hypoechoic plaques (P < .01 for both visual and gray-scale median analysis). Indeed, neutrophil count was greater in PAD than in CAD (4.4 +/- 1.0 vs 3.9 +/- 1.2 10(9)/L, P = .030). The concordance between visual typing of carotid plaques and gray-scale median measurement was good (rho = 0.714, P < .01).\nCompared with CAD patients, those with PAD, in addition to a greater atherosclerotic burden, may have characteristics of instability of carotid plaques that, in turn, may result in cerebrovascular events. Prospective studies are needed to assess specifically whether the greater prevalence of hypoechoic plaques in PAD vs CAD patients is associated with a greater risk of cerebrovascular events.",

    "abstract": "Claudication secondary to peripheral arterial disease leads to reduced mobility, limited physical functioning, and poor health outcomes. Disease severity can be assessed with quantitative clinical methods and qualitative self-perceived measures of quality of life. Limited data exist to document the degree to which quantitative and qualitative measures correlate. The current study provides data on the relationship between quantitative and qualitative measures of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease.\nThis descriptive case series was set in an academic vascular surgery unit and biomechanics laboratory. The subjects were symptomatic patients with peripheral arterial disease patients presenting with claudication. The quantitative evaluation outcome measures included measurement of ankle-brachial index, initial claudication distance, absolute claudication distance, and self-selected treadmill pace. Qualitative measurements included the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey. Spearman rank correlations were performed to determine the relationship between each quantitative and qualitative measure and also between the WIQ and SF-36.\nIncluded were 48 patients (age, 62 +/- 9.6 years; weight, 83.0 +/- 15.4 kg) with claudication (ABI, 0.50 +/- 0.20). Of the four WIQ subscales, the ankle-brachial index correlated with distance (r = 0.29) and speed (r = 0.32); and initial claudication distance and absolute claudication distance correlated with pain (r = 0.40 and 0.43, respectively), distance (r = 0.35 and 0.41, respectively), and speed (r = 0.39 and 0.39 respectively). Of the eight SF-36 subscales, no correlation was found for the ankle-brachial index, initial claudication distance correlated with Bodily Pain (r = 0.46) and Social Functioning (r = 0.30), and absolute claudication time correlated with Physical Function (r = 0.31) and Energy (r = 0.30). The results of both questionnaires showed reduced functional status in claudicating patients.\nInitial and absolute claudication distances and WIQ pain, speed, and distance subscales are the measures that correlated the best with the ambulatory limitation of patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. These results suggest the WIQ is the most specific questionnaire for documenting the qualitative deficits of the patient with claudication while providing strong relationships with the quantitative measures of arterial disease. Future studies of claudication patients should include both quantitative and qualitative assessments to adequately assess disease severity and functional status in peripheral arterial disease patients.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this population-based study was to determine the optimal dividing-line between normal aorta and aneurysm for different aortic segments in 70-year-old men and women by means of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging.\nTwo hundred thirty-one subjects (116 men), randomly recruited from a population-based cohort study, were included. The smallest outer diameter (dia) was measured on the axial survey scan on six predefined aortic segments: (1) ascending aorta, (2) descending aorta, (3) supraceliac aorta, (4) suprarenal aorta, (5) largest infrarenal abdominal aorta, and (6) aortic bifurcation. Relative aortic dia were calculated by dividing a given aortic dia by the suprarenal aortic dia. The dividing-line between normal aorta and aneurysm at different aortic segments was estimated by taking the mean dia +2 SD and/or mean ratio of the aortic segment to the suprarenal aorta +2 SD.\nThe mean dia of the six segments were 4.0 cm (SD 0.4), 3.2 cm (0.3), 3.0 cm (0.3), 2.8 cm (0.3), 2.4 cm (0.5), and 2.3 cm (0.3) in men. The corresponding dia in women were 3.4 cm (0.4), 2.8 cm (0.3), 2.7 cm (0.3), 2.7 cm (0.3), 2.2 cm (0.3), and 2.0 cm (0.2).

    "abstract": "To determine the feasibility of endovascular treatment of inflow stenoses in arteriovenous fistulae (AVFs) through retrograde venous access catheterization.\nWe included all 22 dysfunctional AVFs with arterial inflow stenoses at access imaging between January 2002 and September 2006. Following retrograde venous access puncture, an interventional radiologist intended to cross the arteriovenous anastomosis and advance a catheter into the aortic arch. After depiction of the complete vascular access tree, angioplasty and/or stent placement was aimed for stenoses with a >50% luminal diameter reduction at digital subtraction angiography (DSA).\nIn one radiocephalic AVF, a catheter could not be positioned into the aortic arch after retrograde venous access puncture. DSA depicted 28 inflow stenoses in the remaining 21 patients (11 radiocephalic AVFs and 10 brachiocephalic AVFs). Clinical improvement was obtained in 18 out of 19 patients with a technically successful intervention (<30% residual stenosis after angioplasty or stent placement). Following endovascular therapy, access flow of 12 patients with a low flow access improved from 431 +/- 150 ml/min to 818 +/- 233 ml/min, and four patients with steal symptoms became symptom free. One nonmaturing fistula could be salvaged by angioplasty, and access cannulation problems were solved in another patient following angioplasty. Brachial artery stent placement did not reduce steal symptoms in one case, whereas two patients, in whom stent placement was not thought desirable, showed a >30% residual arterial stenosis after angioplasty. No complications were observed at DSA and endovascular intervention.\nRetrograde venous access puncture and catheterization, as an alternative to a potentially more hazardous brachial artery or more invasive femoral artery approach, should be considered for the visualization of the arterial inflow and endovascular treatment of inflow stenoses.",

Following endovascular therapy, access flow of 12 patients with a low flow access improved from 431 +/- 150 ml/min to 818 +/- 233 ml/min, and four patients with steal symptoms became symptom free. One nonmaturing fistula could be salvaged by angioplasty, and access cannulation problems were solved in another patient following angioplasty. Brachial artery stent placement did not reduce steal symptoms in one case, whereas two patients, in whom stent placement was not thought desirable, showed a >30% residual arterial stenosis after angioplasty. No complications were observed at DSA and endovascular intervention.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an age-related disease. In an aging population, the prevalence of AAA is likely to increase. Open AAA repair in patients aged >80 years is often not considered because of their advanced age as such or because of comorbidities. In addition, little is known about the natural history in such patients or survival after successful repair. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine peri-operative and late survival after AAA repair in octogenarians\nThe Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched to identify all studies reporting on octogenarians undergoing AAA repair published between January 1966 and June 2006. Two independent observers assessed the methodologic quality of the included studies and the data extraction. Outcomes were rates of perioperative mortality, complications, and long-term survival after open or endovascular repair (EVAR). Summary estimates with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random effects model.\nThirty-nine articles were included. The median aneurysm size was 6.7 cm in the conventional AAA repair group of 1534 patients. The perioperative mortality was 0% to 33%, with a pooled mortality of 7.5% (95% CI, 6.2% to 9.0%). The median 5-year survival rate for this group was 60% (range, 14% to 86%). In the 1045 patients treated with EVAR, the median aneurysm size was 5.9 cm. Their pooled perioperative mortality varied from 0% to 6%, with a pooled mortality of 4.6% (95% CI, 3.4 to 6.0%). We could not derive 5-year survival rates from articles describing endovascular repair of AAA.\nThe mortality rate after open or endovascular AAA repair in carefully selected octogenarians seems acceptable but is higher than the mortality rate in younger patients. Long-term survival rates were acceptable, but small sample size, selection, and publication bias must be taken into account. Finally, selection criteria for successful surgery with low mortality and morbidity rates cannot be derived from the literature.",

    "abstract": "Products of heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) possess antithrombotic properties, and impairment of HO1 activity may contribute to thrombus formation. Transcriptional activity of long GT-repeat alleles in HO1 gene (HMOX1) is lower as compared with short alleles. We hypothesize that these long alleles are associated with decreased HO1 anticoagulant activity and, thus, an increased risk of thrombosis..\nIn a prospective cohort study, we followed 860 patients with a first VTE, and investigated the impact of a promoter GT-dinucleotid length polymorphism in HOMX1 on the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE).\nAllele groups short (S), medium (M) and long (L) of the promoter GT-dinucleotide length polymorphism were distinguished. L-alleles, but not M- or S-alleles, were found to be more frequent among patients with recurrence. Heterozygous carriers of L-alleles had a two-fold higher relative risk of recurrence [(RR 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4-3.4)] as compared to wild type, which was independent of other thrombotic risk factors. At five years, the cumulative probability of recurrence was 18% (95% CI: 15%-22%) in patients without an L-allele compared to 32% (95% CI: 19%-46%) in patients heterozygous for the L-allele (P = .001).\nPatients with first VTE and long GT-repeat alleles in HMOX1 have an increased risk of recurrence.

    "abstract": "The perioperative mortality for people with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAA) has not changed for two decades. Of patients who survive long enough to undergo open repair for ruptured aneurysms, half die (48%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 46 to 50). Randomized trials have shown that endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for nonruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms decreases perioperative mortality compared with open repair. EVAR may similarly benefit patients with RAAA. We aimed to summarize studies of patients undergoing EVAR for ruptured aneurysms.\nTwo reviewers searched Medline and EMBASE databases from 1994 to July 2006, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Best Evidence 1994 to 2006, reference lists, clinical trial registries, and conference proceedings; we also contacted authors. All published and unpublished studies in which a group of people with ruptured aneurysms, assessed objectively by imaging, was treated with EVAR (REVAR) were eligible. We used the generic inverse variance function of the REVMAN software to pool results for death in hospital. Sensitivity analyses, using prespecified subgroups, explored heterogeneity between studies.\nPooled mortality in 18 observational studies describing 436 people who underwent REVAR was 21% (95% CI 13 to 29); however, 90% of the heterogeneity between studies was not explained by chance alone. Surgical volume explained substantial heterogeneity. According to study-specific criteria, 47% (95% CI 39 to 55) of people with ruptured aneurysms were potentially eligible for REVAR.\nMortality in people who underwent REVAR is lower than that in historical reports of unselected people undergoing open repair. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the difference in mortality is attributable to patient selection alone or to this new approach to treatment.",

The abdominal computed tomography scan showed a tumor in the infrahepatic portion of the inferior vena cava and the confluence of the renal veins. After resection of the tumor, venous reconstruction involved the replacement of the inferior vena cava with a prosthetic graft and the implantation of the right renal vein into the portal vein. The left renal vein was ligated distally, with preservation of collateral pathways. To our knowledge, no other reports of such venous reconstruction have been published. After a follow-up of 30 months, the patient has shown no further symptoms, and the abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrates patency of the renal portal anastomosis. Tests indicated normal renal and hepatic function, suggesting good tolerance of the renal portal anastomosis. We believe that the technique described in this report should be adopted routinely for tumors located in the renal veins, provided complete resection of the tumor with a comfortable resection margin is possible.",

    "abstract": "We report about a young patient with a large aneurysm of the left external iliac vein associated with a traumatic arteriovenous fistula between the left superficial femoral artery and the femoral vein after a stab wound 20 years ago. The patient presented with swelling of the left leg, which developed during the past years and worsened after saphenectomy 12 months before hospital admission. The chronically hyperperfused common iliac artery proximal to the arteriovenous fistula was compressing the common iliac vein. The venous outflow obstruction and subsequent venous hypertension render a possible explanation for the formation of the iliac vein aneurysm. Surgical repair of the venous aneurysm by interposition grafting and closure of the arteriovenous fistula was successful. A postoperative computed tomography scan showed a 50% size reduction of the feeding artery, underlining the ability of the arterial system to normalize arterial diameter in response to flow reduction, even after a high flow situation had existed for probably >20 years.",

    "abstract": "Mobile thrombus of the thoracic aorta is an uncommon pathology with potentially catastrophic complications. Recurrent spontaneous distal embolization may also occur from an ulcerated thrombus of the abdominal aorta. The simultaneous presence of a mobile thrombus in the thoracic aorta and ulcerated thrombus of the abdominal aorta is extremely rare and poses a significant treatment dilemma. Although various approaches have been reported, there is no standard treatment. Direct replacement of the thoracoabdominal aorta is extremely morbid, while continued embolization despite anticoagulation mandate intervention. We herein present the first case report of successful treatment of symptomatic mobile/ulcerated thrombi of the thoracic and abdominal aorta using staged endovascular stent graft repair. Successful treatment of the thoracic component with a thoracic aortic graft (TAG, Gore-Tex, W. L. Gore & Assoc., Flagstaff, Ariz.) was followed one week later by exclusion of the infrarenal aortic lesion with a bifurcated stent graft. Endovascular stent graft exclusion of mobile/ulcerated thoracic and abdominal aortic thrombi is a minimal invasive operation. It can be employed as an alternative procedure in treatment of aortic thrombus with embolization in high risk patients. Long-term follow-up will be necessary to assess the durability of this technique.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to inhibit neointimal hyperplasia after arterial interventions in several animal models. To date, however, NO-based therapies have not been used in the clinical arena. Our objective was to combine nanofiber delivery vehicles with NO chemistry to create a novel, more potent NO-releasing therapy that can be used clinically. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the perivascular application of spontaneously self-assembling NO-releasing nanofiber gels. Our hypothesis was that this application would prevent neointimal hyperplasia.\nGels consisted of a peptide amphiphile, heparin, and a diazeniumdiolate NO donor (1-[N-(3-Aminopropyl)-N-(3-ammoniopropyl)]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate [DPTA/NO] or disodium 1-[(2-Carboxylato)pyrrolidin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate [PROLI/NO]). Nitric oxide release from the gels was evaluated by the Griess reaction, and scanning electron microscopy confirmed nanofiber formation. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and cell death were assessed in vitro by (3)H-thymidine incorporation and Personal Cell Analysis (PCA) system (Guava Technologies, Hayward, Calif). For the in vivo work, gels were modified by reducing the free-water content. Neointimal hyperplasia after periadventitial gel application was evaluated using the rat carotid artery injury model at 14 days (n = 6 per group). Inflammation and proliferation were examined in vivo with immunofluorescent staining against CD45, ED1, and Ki67 at 3 days (n = 2 per group), and graded by blinded observers. Endothelialization was assessed by Evans blue injection at 7 days (n = 3 per group).\nBoth DPTA/NO and PROLI/NO, combined with the peptide amphiphile and heparin, formed nanofiber gels and released NO for 4 days. In vitro, DPTA/NO inhibited VSMC proliferation and induced cell death to a greater extent than PROLI/NO. However, the DPTA/NO nanofiber gel only reduced neointimal hyperplasia by 45% (intima/media [I/M] area ratio, 0.45 +/- 0.07), whereas the PROLI/NO nanofiber gel reduced neointimal hyperplasia by 77% (I/M area ratio, 0.19 +/- 0.03, P < .05) vs control (injury alone I/M area ratio, 0.83 +/- 0.07; P < .05). Both DPTA/NO and PROLI/NO nanofiber gels significantly inhibited proliferation in vivo (1.06 +/- 0.30 and 0.19 +/- 0.11 vs injury alone, 2.02 +/- 0.20, P < .05), yet had minimal effect on apoptosis. Only the PROLI/NO nanofiber gel inhibited inflammation (monocytes and leukocytes). Both NO-releasing nanofiber gels stimulated re-endothelialization.\nPerivascular application of NO-releasing self-assembling nanofiber gels is an effective and simple therapy to prevent neointimal hyperplasia after arterial injury. Our study demonstrates that the PROLI/NO nanofiber gel most effectively prevented neointimal hyperplasia and resulted in less inflammation than the DPTA/NO nanofiber gel. This therapy has great clinical potential to prevent neointimal hyperplasia after open vascular interventions in patients.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic aneurysms are the main cardiovascular complication of Marfan syndrome (MFS) resulting in premature death. MFS has been associated with mutations of the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1), a major constituent of the elastic fibers. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms but their precise role in MFS is not clear. Doxycycline is a nonspecific MMP inhibitor. The objective of the study was to determine whether docycycline can attenuate matrix degradation and prolong the survival of mice with MFS.\nThe study employed a well-characterized animal model of MFS, namely fibrillin-1 under-expressing mice (mgR/mgR mice) that die spontaneously from rupture of the thoracic aorta between 2 to 4 months of age. Mutant and wild type mice were given doxycycline in their drinking water at a concentration designed to provide 100 mg/kg/day beginning at postnatal day (PD) 1, whereas control mice were given water. Treated mice were divided into two groups. One group of animals was followed until death or for 7 months to determine lifespan. In the second group of mice, the ascending thoracic aortas were collected for histological analysis (H&E staining, trichrome staining) and zymography for examining MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels at 6 weeks.\nMMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were higher in the thoracic aorta of mgR/mgR mice compared with wild type littermates. Doxycycline-treated mgR/mgR mice lived 132 +/- 14.6 days (n = 16) or significantly longer than untreated mutant mice (79 +/- 6.7 days, n = 30) (P < 0.01). Connective tissue staining showed that doxycycline treatment decreased elastic fiber degradation in mgR/mgR mice. Furthermore, mgR/mgR mice treated with doxycycline had lower MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels compared with untreated mgR/mgR mice.\nThis study demonstrates that doxycycline significantly delays aneurysm rupture in MFS-like mice by inhibiting expression of tissue MMP-2 and MMP-9 and thus, degradation of the elastic matrix. The results suggest that MMPs contribute to the progression of thoracic aneurysm in MFS and that doxycycline has the potential to significantly alter the course of the disease.",

    "abstract": "A recent meta-analysis has suggested that patients aged >65 have worse outcomes with radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas (RCAVFs) compared with brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas (BCAVFs). We hypothesized that outcomes in patients aged > or = 80--a rapidly expanding cohort within this elderly group--might be skewing the results, and that age >65 may not be a contraindication to RCAVF formation. This study examined the effect of age group (<65, 65 to 79, >or =80) on functional outcomes (use; primary and secondary functional patency) in RCVAFs and BCAVFs.\nWe identified the outcomes of all patients undergoing a first surgical access procedure for a RCAVF or BCVAF between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2005. We examined the effect of age and other factors including sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, late referral (<3 months before dialysis), dialysis before surgical access, preoperative duplex ultrasound imaging, and ethnicity on non-AVF use and primary and secondary functional AVF patency. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used.\nFrom a total of 658 patients, 361 had a RCAVF, and 297 had a BCAVF. Their median age was 68.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 54.4 to 76.5 years), and 288 (43.8%) were aged <65 years, 274 (41.6%) were 65 to 79, and 96 (14.6%) were > or =80. Age did not influence the site of the first surgical access (P = .874). Only 85.7% of patients actually progressed to hemodialysis, and the RCAVF or BCAVF in 45.7% of those was never used for dialysis. Female sex (hazard ratio [HR], 2.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.387 to 3.643; P = .001) was the only factor associated with an increase risk of RCAVF nonuse, whereas diabetes (HR, 2.095; 95% CI, 1.261 to 3.482; P = .004) was the only factor associated with an increase risk of BCAVF nonuse. The respective primary patency rates at 1 and 2 years for RCAVFs were 46.0% and 27.1% for patients <65, 47.0% and 36.0% for those 65 to 79, and 45.7% and 38.1% for those >or =80. Only female sex (HR, 1.679; 95% CI, 1.261 to 2.236; P = .001) and prior hemodialysis (HR, 1.363; 95% CI, 1.0.29 to 1.804; P = .031) were associated with loss of patency of RCAVFs. The primary functional patency rates for BCAVFs at 1 and 2 years were 39.3% and 31.0% for those <65 years; 53.30% and 37.5% for those 65 to 79, and 46.3% and 42.6% for those >or =80. No factors analyzed were associated with loss of primary functional patency of BCAVFs.\nAge did not affect usability, primary or secondary patency of either RCAVFs or BCAVFs. Although patient selection is important, even patients > or =80 years who are considered suitable for surgical placement of access should not be denied a RCAVF solely because of age.",

    "abstract": "This study reports our midterm results with arteriovenous axillary loop grafts (AVALG) and evaluates their role in construction of vascular access for patients on chronic hemodialysis.\nThe clinical data of 27 patients who underwent construction of an AVALG for hemodialysis access at our institution between July 2002 and December 2006 were analyzed retrospectively. Outcome measures included graft patency, the complication rate, and the frequency and morbidity of secondary procedures after AVALG creation. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the primary and secondary patency curves.\nAVALG was constructed as the first access procedure in eight patients: five patients with no suitable vein to construct an adequate angioaccess on the upper limbs, and three patients with elbow and forearm arteritis. The 19 other patients had all had two to five failed prior vascular accesses leading to exhaustion of venous access sites on the upper extremities (18 cases), or a steal syndrome (one case). No postoperative death occurred, but four patients died of causes unrelated to the intervention between the second and the tenth postoperative months. The mean follow-up was 15 months (range, 2-48 months). The primary patency rate at 12 months and the secondary patency rate at 18 months were 51% and 80%, respectively. Infection (three cases), thrombosis (seven cases), and stenosis of the outflow vein (two cases) were the main complications, occurring in 10 of the 27 patients (41%). Twelve secondary procedures were performed in these 10 patients with little additional morbidity. Five of the 27 patients developed irreversible AVALG occlusion leading to access loss: two patients with concomitant graft infection and three patients with a history of subclavian vein catheterization.\nAVALG may represent a supplementary option for chronic hemodialysis patients with vascular steal or inadequate upper extremity venous access sites.",

This study examined the quality of life (QoL) of patients with TA using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey, a validated health related QoL questionnaire.\nQuestionnaires that included the SF-36 and demographic related variables were mailed to 392 patients enrolled in the Takayasu's Arteritis Research Association. Raw SF-36 scores, as well as Physical Health Summary (PHS) and Mental Health Summary (MHS) scores, were calculated according to standard protocols. Data were analyzed for predictors of superior QoL using univariate and stepwise logistic regression analysis. SF-36 scores were also compared with those of other chronic diseases associated with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) published in the literature. Results are reported as mean +/- standard error of the mean.\nA total of 158 patients (144 women, 14 men) with average age of 42.2 +/- 1.1 years responded to the questionnaire. Mean onset of symptoms occurred at 30.5 +/- 1.2 years, with a mean age at diagnosis of 34.7 +/- 1.2, and a median of four doctors were seen before diagnosis. The group underwent 299 TA-related surgical procedures (1.9 +/- 0.3), including coronary (38%), carotid (35%), upper extremity (30%), and lower extremity (26%) revascularization. PHS and MHS summary scores (39.2 +/- 1.0 and 44.5 +/- 1.0, respectively) were worse than mean scores for an age-matched healthy population as well as nationally reported scores for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease (all P < .0001). Multivariate predictors of better physical QoL were younger age (P = .003) and remission of the disease (P = .0002). The use of immunomodulating medications was associated with inferior physical QoL (P = .02). The sole predictor of better mental QoL was remission of disease (P = .002).\nTA is a rare disease with profound consequences on QoL. Scores for physical and mental health are worse compared with many other chronic diseases associated with PVD. Superior physical QoL is seen in younger patients, whereas inferior physical QoL is encountered in those who take immunomodulating medications. Because the only factor to influence positively both physical and mental QoL is disease remission, every effort should be directed to attenuate disease activity.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) presenting as intermittent claudication (IC) is routinely assessed as the distance or time walked to the onset of pain, which often occurs before significant cardiopulmonary stress and is subject to confounding factors such as increased body mass and altered gait. Thus, where exercise-induced cardiovascular stress is desirable, such as in cardiac stress testing or clinical trials, an alternative modality of exercise is required. Cycling will circumvent several of the associated problems of treadmill walking and may provide an alternative preferable method of exercise, although there is limited information on the physiologic response of patients with PAD to cycling. This study compared the peak cardiorespiratory responses and the repeatability of cycling and treadmill exercise in patients with PAD.\nTen men (mean age, 54 +/- 10 years) with stable IC completed two incremental exercise tests to the limit of tolerance on a treadmill and a cycle ergometer after familiarization with the outcome measures of exercise duration, work performed, respiratory gas exchange variables using continuous breath-by-breath measurement, heart rate, and ratings of perceived pain.\nBoth methods of exercise assessment revealed high reproducibility in terms of absolute claudication time (treadmill, r = 0.95; cycle, r = 0.91), time to volitional fatigue (treadmill, r = 0.96; cycle, r = 0.91), and cardiopulmonary exercise responses such as the lactate threshold (treadmill, r = 0.95; cycle, r = 0.94), peak heart rate (treadmill, r = 0.94; cycle, r = 0.96), and peak oxygen uptake (treadmill, r = 0.98; cycle, r = 0.87). Cycling induced significantly higher cardiopulmonary responses (peak heart rate, peak carbon dioxide output, peak minute ventilation, and respiratory exchange ratio) than treadmill exercise. There was no difference in time to volitional fatigue or in absolute claudication time between exercise modalities.\nThese results demonstrate that exercise testing using cycling offers an alternative method of cardiopulmonary testing for patients with IC that is equally reliable and reproducible to treadmill walking. Cycling may be preferable to treadmill exercise because it induces greater cardiopulmonary and metabolic responses and is better tolerated by patients.",

Preprocedural B-mode DUS images of the plaque at the most distal occlusion segment were digitalized and normalized using Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, Calif) software and standard criteria (gray level, 0 to 5 for lumen blood and 185 to 190 for the adventitia on a linear scale of 0 to 255). Overall GSM of the plaque segment about 2 cm long, immediately before the planned re-entry point to the true arterial lumen, was used for retrospective correlation with procedure success and other clinical indicators.\nMean plaque GSM for all cases was 22.5 +/- 12.6 (range, 3 to 60). The overall success rate of subintimal angioplasty procedures was 85%. Mean plaque GSM for 99 successful cases (18.4 +/- 7.8) was significantly lower than for 17 cases (46.4 +/- 8.1) where we failed (P < .0001).

    "abstract": "Although patients with diabetes are at increased risk of amputation from peripheral vascular disease, excellent limb-salvage rates have been achieved with aggressive surgical revascularization. It is less clear whether patients with diabetes will fare as well as nondiabetics after undergoing percutaneous lower extremity revascularization, a modality which is becoming increasingly utilized for this disease process. This study aimed to assess differential outcomes in between diabetics and nondiabetics in lower extremity percutaneous interventions.\nWe retrospectively studied 291 patients with respect to patient variables, complications, and outcomes for percutaneous interventions performed for peripheral occlusive disease between 2002 and 2005. Tibial vessel run-off was assessed by angiography. Patency (assessed arterial duplex) was expressed by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank analysis. Mean follow-up was 11.6 months (range 1 to 56 months).\nA total of 385 interventions for peripheral occlusive disease with claudication (52.2%), rest pain (16.4%), or tissue loss (31.4%) were analyzed, including 336 primary interventions and 49 reinterventions (mean patient age 73.9 years, 50.8% male). Comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (57.2%), chronic renal insufficiency (18.4%), hemodialysis (3.8%), hypertension (81.9%), hypercholesterolemia (57%), coronary artery disease (58%), tobacco use (63.2%). Diabetics were significantly more likely to be female (55.3% vs 40.8%), and suffer from CRI (23.5% vs 12.0%), a history of myocardial infarction (36.5% vs 18.0%), and <three-vessel tibial outflow (83.5% vs 71.8%), compared with nondiabetics, although all other comorbidities and lesion characteristics were equivalent between these groups. Overall primary patency (+/- SE) at 6, 12, and 18 months was 85 +/- 2%, 63 +/- 3% and 56 +/- 4%, respectively. Patients with diabetes suffered reduced primary patency at 1 year compared with nondiabetics. For nondiabetics, primary patency was 88 +/- 2%, 71 +/- 4%, and 58 +/- 4% at 6, 12, and 18 months, while for diabetics it was 82 +/- 2%, 53 +/- 4%, and 49 +/- 4%, respectively (P = .05). Overall secondary patency at 6, 12, and 18 months was 88 +/- 2%, 76 +/- 3%, and 69 +/- 3%, and did not vary by diabetes status. One-year limb salvage rate was 88.3% for patients with limb-threatening ischemia, which was also similar between diabetics and nondiabetics. While univariate analysis revealed that female gender, <three-vessel tibial outflow, and a history of tobacco use were all predictive of reduced primary patency (P < .05), none of these factors significantly impacted secondary patency or limb-salvage rate. Furthermore, only limb-threatening ischemia remained a significant predictor of outcome on multivariate analysis, suggesting that the poorer primary patency in diabetics is related primarily to their propensity to present with limb-threatening disease compared with nondiabetics.\nPatients with diabetes demonstrate reduced primary patency rates after percutaneous treatment of lower extremity occlusive disease, most likely due to their advanced stage of disease at presentation. However, despite a higher reintervention rate, diabetics and others with risk factors predictive of reduced primary patency can attain equivalent short-term secondary patency and limb-salvage rates.

    "abstract": "Although evidence is accumulating that advanced age is a risk factor for carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS), the reason for this finding is incompletely understood. The aims of this study were to compare the prevalence of anatomic risk factors in patients <80 years with those in patients > or =80 years and to determine the effect of these risk factors on the incidence of new lesions seen on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) after protected CAS as surrogate markers for stroke.\nVarious potential anatomic risk factors for CAS were analyzed in 62 symptomatic patients (49 aged <80 years; 13 aged > or =80 years) by using preprocedural digital subtraction angiograms and extracranial contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiographies. DWI was performed immediately before and <or =48 hours after the procedure. Clinical outcome measures were stroke and death <or =30 days.\nThe octogenarians had a significantly higher incidence of severe aortic arch calcification (54% vs 14%, P < .01) and ulcerated stenoses (69% vs 22%, P < .01), but no statistically significant differences were found between treatment groups in elongation of the aortic arch, common or internal artery tortuousities, degree of stenosis, or length of the stenosis. Although the differences in clinical outcome between the treatment groups (4% aged <80 years vs 8% >or =80 years) were not significant, the proportion of patients with any new ipsilateral DWI lesions, as well as the total number of these lesions, was higher in octogenarians than in patients aged <80 years (85% vs 47%, P < .05), with a median of 2 (interquartile range [IQR], 1 to 5) vs 0 (IQR, 0 to 3; P = .07). Similarly, the proportion of patients with any new DWI lesions outside the vascular territory of the target vessel as well as the total number of these lesions was significantly higher in octogenarians compared with patients aged <80 years (54% vs 10%, P < .01), with a median of 1.5 (IQR, 0.25 to 10.75) vs 0 (IQR, 0 to 1; P < .05). The presence of an ulcerated lesion was an independent predictor of any new ipsilateral DWI lesion (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06 to 17.1; P < .05), whereas a severe aortic arch calcification tended to be a predictor of new DWI lesions outside the territory of the treated artery (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.99 to 3335; P = .05).\nIncreased prevalences of severe aortic arch calcifications and target lesion ulceration are associated with an increased risk for magnetic resonance DWI-detected embolic events during CAS. Because in our study arch calcification and target lesion ulceration were more prevalent in octogenarians, this association may explain the increased risk of CAS in the elderly.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is an evolving and increasingly common endovascular treatment for carotid artery stenosis. Risk factors associated with an increased incidence of adverse periprocedural neurologic outcomes are being recognized. The goal of this study was to determine if certain angiographic lesion characteristics were predictive of higher risks of adverse outcomes.\nA total of 421 patients who underwent 429 carotid artery stenting procedures between June 1996 and June 2005 for symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis, and in whom preoperative carotid angiograms and follow-up records were available for review, were selected from a prospectively maintained database. Demographic data and procedural variables were recorded, including the presence or absence of the use of a cerebral protection device. Angiograms were reviewed for the following carotid lesion characteristics: length of lesion, percentage of stenosis, ostial involvement, lesion ulceration, calcification, and presence of contralateral carotid occlusion. Periprocedural stroke and 30-day adverse event rates (stroke, myocardial infarction, and death) were recorded for each patient.\nThe periprocedural all-stroke rate was 3.7%. Octogenarians had a higher incidence of 30-day adverse events at 10.0% vs 3.8% (P = .029). The incidence of periprocedural stroke was increased in lesions > or =15 mm long, at 17.0% (8 of 47) vs 2.1% (8 of 382; P < .001), and in ostial centered lesions, 7.1% (11 of 154) vs 1.8% (5 of 275; P = .007). Multivariate regression also identified these two variables as independently associated with 30-day stroke rate: lesion length > or =15 mm (odds ratio [OR], 6.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 35 to 17.29) or ostial involvement (OR, 3.12; 95% CI, 3.12 to 8.36). Other variables, including lesion calcification, ulceration, degree of stenosis, or presence of contralateral occlusion, were not associated with adverse outcomes. When studied separately, the use of cerebral protection devices in 241 patients (56%) did not change our observed correlations between angiographic characteristics and adverse procedural events.\nCertain lesion characteristics on angiography, such as length and ostial location, can predict adverse outcomes. The indication for CAS should be carefully evaluated in these cases.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound velocity criteria for the diagnosis of in-stent restenosis in patients undergoing carotid artery stenting (CAS) are not well established. In the present study, we test whether ultrasound velocity measurements correlate with increasing degrees of in-stent restenosis in patients undergoing CAS and develop customized velocity criteria to identify residual stenosis > or =20%, in-stent restenosis > or =50%, and high-grade in-stent restenosis > or =80%.\nCarotid angiograms performed at the completion of CAS were compared with duplex ultrasound (DUS) imaging performed immediately after the procedure. Patients were followed up with annual DUS imaging and underwent both ultrasound scans and computed tomography angiography (CTA) at their most recent follow-up visit. Patients with suspected high-grade in-stent restenosis on DUS imaging underwent diagnostic carotid angiograms. DUS findings were therefore available for comparison with luminal stenosis measured by carotid angiograms or CTA in all these patients. The DUS protocol included peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) measurements in the native common carotid artery (CCA), proximal stent, mid stent, distal stent, and distal internal carotid artery (ICA).\nOf 255 CAS procedures that were reviewed, 39 had contralateral ICA stenosis and were excluded from the study. During a mean follow-up of 4.6 years (range, 1 to 10 years), 23 patients died and 64 were lost. Available for analysis were 189 pairs of ultrasound and procedural carotid angiogram measurements; 99 pairs of ultrasound and CTA measurements during routine follow-up; and 29 pairs of ultrasound and carotid angiograms measurements during follow-up for suspected high-grade in-stent restenosis > or =80% (n = 310 pairs of observations, ultrasound vs carotid angiograms/CTA). The accuracy of CTA vs carotid angiograms was confirmed (r(2) = 0.88) in a subset of 19 patients. Post-CAS PSV (r(2) = .85) and ICA/CCA ratios (r(2) = 0.76) correlated most with the degree of stenosis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated the following optimal threshold criteria: residual stenosis > or =20% (PSV >or =150 cm/s and ICA/CCA ratio > or =2.15), in-stent restenosis > or =50% (PSV > or =220 cm/s and ICA/CCA ratio > or =2.7), and in-stent restenosis > or =80% (PSV 340 cm/s and ICA/CCA ratio > or =4.15).\nProgressively increasing PSV and ICA/CCA ratios correlate with evolving restenosis within the stented carotid artery. Ultrasound velocity criteria developed for native arteries overestimate the degree of in-stent restenosis encountered. These changes persist during long-term follow-up and across all grades of in-stent restenosis after CAS. The proposed new velocity criteria accurately define residual stenosis >or =20%, in-stent restenosis >or =50%, and high-grade in-stent restenosis > or =80% in the stented carotid artery.",

    "abstract": "Osteopontin (OPN) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are well-known vascular calcification inhibitors, which have been recently demonstrated to correlate with inflammation and cardiovascular events incidence. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to survey whether OPN and OPG are involved in carotid plaque vulnerability. For this reason, we assessed serum OPN and OPG levels in patients with carotid stenosis, and we explored their relationship with carotid plaque echogenicity and subsequent cerebrovascular ischemic events.\nA total of 164 Whites were selected from a large cohort of 297 subjects to participate. In particular, 114 patients (61 men, 53 women), aged 55 to 80, had recently-diagnosed ICA stenosis higher than 50%. A group of 50 age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy individuals served as healthy controls. Patients with renal failure, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, and lipid-lowering therapy were excluded. Images of both carotids were obtained from all participants using a high-resolution color duplex ultrasound and the gray-scale median (GSM) score was calculated. Brain computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans when CT was questionable, were performed on all patients with carotid stenosis. Clinical parameters, lipid and glycemic indexes, hsCRP, fibrinogen, white blood cells (WBC) count, OPN, and OPG were measured. Independent t test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression analysis were used for statistical analysis.\nAmong patients with carotid stenosis, 60 had history of ipsilateral stroke or TIA and positive CT or MRI findings (group A), while 54 had no neurological symptoms and negative CT and MRI scan (group B). Overall, patients with carotid stenosis showed worse lipid profile and increased waist circumference, blood pressure, hsCRP, fibrinogen, WBC count, OPN, and OPG levels compared with healthy subjects (group C) (P <.05). Statistical analysis revealed that group A had significantly lower levels of GSM than group B (57.41 +/- 38.19 vs 76.32 +/- 36.72; P = .008) and higher levels of hsCRP, OPN, and OPG than groups B and C (P < .05). Concerning the latter, biochemical markers group B showed only elevated OPG levels compared with group C (P = .038). Notably, GSM was considerably associated with serum OPN and OPG and waist circumference in patients with carotid atherosclerosis in univariate (r = -0.333; P = .032, r = -0.575; P < .001, r = -0.590; P =.006, respectively) and multiple regression analysis (R(2) = 0.445; P =.006).\nThe present study demonstrated elevated serum OPN and OPG levels in patients with carotid stenosis and documented an independent association between these biochemical markers, GSM and carotid-induced symptomatology. Therefore bone-matrix proteins combined with GSM could be potential markers for vulnerable carotid plaques.",

Overall, patients with carotid stenosis showed worse lipid profile and increased waist circumference, blood pressure, hsCRP, fibrinogen, WBC count, OPN, and OPG levels compared with healthy subjects (group C) (P <.05). Statistical analysis revealed that group A had significantly lower levels of GSM than group B (57.41 +/- 38.19 vs 76.32 +/- 36.72; P = .008) and higher levels of hsCRP, OPN, and OPG than groups B and C (P < .05). Concerning the latter, biochemical markers group B showed only elevated OPG levels compared with group C (P = .038). Notably, GSM was considerably associated with serum OPN and OPG and waist circumference in patients with carotid atherosclerosis in univariate (r = -0.333; P = .032, r = -0.575; P < .001, r = -0.590; P =.006, respectively) and multiple regression analysis (R(2) = 0.445; P =.006).",

    "abstract": "Because there is a paucity of data about management and outcome of true profunda femoris artery aneurysms (PFAAs), we reviewed our 21-year experience with surgical repair of PFAAs.\nClinical data from the 15 patients who underwent repair between 1985 and 2006 were retrospectively reviewed.\nFifteen men had 17 PFAAs (mean diameter, of 3.4 cm). Three had an acute presentation with rupture (n = 2) or acute limb ischemia (n = 1), one had local tenderness, and 11 were asymptomatic. Sizes of the ruptured PFAAs were 1.5 and 7.5 cm. Eleven patients (73%) had synchronous aneurysms, most frequently in the popliteal artery (n = 7). Three of the asymptomatic patients required an emergency operation because of acute lower extremity ischemia caused by thrombosis of a synchronous popliteal aneurysm (n = 2) or for a ruptured iliac aneurysm (n = 1). Aneurysmectomy with graft interposition between the common femoral and PFA was used in 15 repairs. Ligation alone was used for one aneurysm, and another was treated by partial aneurysmectomy with primary repair. There were no deaths, graft thrombosis, or limb loss at 30 days. At a mean follow-up of 28 months (range, 3 to 108 months), one patient required above knee amputation 2 years after aneurysm ligation, and another patient presented with a recurrent aneurysm. Long-term graft patency was 100%.\nPFAAs are rare but often occur with synchronous aneurysms. One-third of patients presented with complications of limb ischemia or rupture caused by their PFAA or synchronous aneurysms. Good-risk patients with a PFAA >2 cm should undergo elective repair. Aneurysmectomy with femoral interposition graft is a durable repair.",

    "abstract": "A significant increase in the frequency of inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement at our large community-based academic health center led us to evaluate changes in indications, devices, and providers over the past decade.\nA single-center retrospective review of all filter placements was performed comparing 76 patients in 1995 with 470 patients in 2005. Demographic data, provider data, filter type, and indications for placement were tabulated. Complications, follow-up evaluation, filter removal, and patient outcomes were examined.\nThere was a greater than sixfold increase in the number of filters placed in 2005 vs 1995. There were no significant differences in patient demographics or the extent of venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease during this period except for an increase in median age. Filter placement by interventional radiologists remained approximately 50% of the total whereas placement by vascular/trauma surgeons increased to 24% and placement by cardiologists decreased to 29% (P < .001). In 2005, a smaller percentage of filters were placed for absolute indications, while filter placements for relative and prophylactic indications increased over the same time period, especially among cardiologists (P = .02). Potentially retrievable filters are increasingly being used for prophylaxis; however, only 2.4% were retrieved. An increasing number of filters were placed in patients with only infrapopliteal deep venous thrombosis (P = .07). A shift was seen to lower profile and removable filter types. Long-term patient follow-up showed little change in disease progression or in morbidity and mortality of filter insertion.\nTechnological and practice pattern changes have led to an increase in filters inserted by vascular and trauma surgeons in the operating room and intensive care units. Increased diagnosis of VTE disease and newer low profile delivery systems in patients may also have contributed to the significant increase in filter placement. A shift in indications for placement from absolute toward relative indications and prophylaxis is evident over time and across providers, indicating the need for consensus development of appropriate criteria.",

Patients were separated into two groups: group 1 (n = 65) had OAR before and group 2 (n = 46) after an EVAR program was adopted at the medical school in mid-2000. Perioperative death and morbidity, location of proximal aortic clamp, management of the left renal vein, associated iliac aneurysmal or occlusive diseases, the type of surgical reconstruction, operating time, and lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and the hospital were recorded. All the data were compared between the two groups.\nRetroperitoneal approach, suprarenal clamping, left renal vein division, and longer operating room time were statistically more common in group 2 (36.9% vs 12.3%, P = .002; 15.2% vs 3.1%, P = .032; 23.9% vs 7.7%, P = .026; and 117 +/- 8 min vs 95 +/-7 min, P < .001, respectively). Although group 2 had significantly more iliac aneurysms (52.1% vs 32.3%; P = .036), the number of bifurcated reconstructions was comparable. The overall perioperative mortality rate was 1.8% (2 of 111), and the figures for groups 1 and 2 were comparable (3.1% vs 0%; P = .510). No deaths were cardiac related. Group 2 had a significantly higher incidence of kidney failure (8.7% vs 0%; P = .027). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an overall 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival rate of 80.6%, 67.2%, and 59.4%, respectively, with a 3- and 5-year survival rate comparable between groups 1 and 2 (77.8% and 66.7% vs 87.8% and 45.8%, respectively; log-rank test, P = .921).\nOctogenarians can tolerate OAR with acceptable rates of perioperative mortality and morbidity. Although the complexity of OAR has increased significantly in the era of EVAR, the perioperative outcome has not changed.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture occurs when wall stress exceeds wall strength. Engineering principles suggest that aneurysm diameter is only one aspect of its geometry that influences wall stress. Finite element analysis considers the complete geometry and determines wall stresses throughout the structure. This article investigates the interoperator and intraoperator reliability of finite element analysis in the calculation of peak wall stress (PWS) in AAA and examines the variation in PWS in elective and acute AAAs.\nFull ethics and institutional approval was obtained. The study recruited 70 patients (30 acute, 40 elective) with an infrarenal AAA. Computed tomography (CT) images were obtained of the AAA from the renal vessels to the aortic bifurcation. Manual edge extraction, three-dimensional reconstruction, and blinded finite element analysis were performed to ascertain location and value of PWS. Ten CT data sets were analyzed by four different operators to ascertain interoperator reliability and by one operator twice to ascertain intraoperator reliability. An intraclass correlation coefficient was obtained. The Mann-Whitney U test and independent samples t test compared groups for statistical significance.\nThe intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.71 for interoperator reliability and 0.84 for intraoperator reliability. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean (SD) maximal AAA diameter between elective (6.47 [1.30] cm) and acute (7.08 [1.39] cm) patients (P = .073). The difference in PWS between elective (0.67 [0.30] MPa) and acute (1.11 [0.51] MPa) patients (P = .008) was statistically significant, however.\nInteroperator and intraoperator reliability in the derivation of PWS is acceptable. PWS, but not maximal diameter, was significantly higher in acute AAAs than in elective AAAs.",

    "abstract": "The Clinical Practice Council of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) was charged with providing an updated consensus on guidelines for hospital privileges in vascular and endovascular surgery. One compelling reason to update these recommendations is that vascular surgery as a specialty has continued to evolve with a significant shift towards endovascular therapies. The Society for Vascular Surgery is making the following four recommendations concerning guidelines for hospital privileges for vascular and endovascular surgery. First, anyone applying for new hospital privileges to perform vascular surgery should have completed an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical-accredited vascular surgery residency and should obtain American Board of Surgery certification in vascular surgery within 3 years of completion of their training. Second, we reaffirm and provide updated recommendations concerning previous established guidelines for peripheral endovascular procedures, thoracic and abdominal aortic endograft replacements, and carotid artery balloon angioplasty and stenting for trainees and already credentialed physicians who are adding these new procedures to their hospital credentials. Third, we endorse the Residency Review Committee for Surgery recommendations regarding open and endovascular cases during vascular residency training. Fourth, we endorse the Inter-societal Commission for Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories (ICAVL) recommendations for noninvasive vascular laboratory interpretations and examinations to become a registered physician in vascular interpretation (RPVI) or a registered vascular technologist (RVT).",

    "abstract": "The use of carotid stenting in octogenarian patients is controversial; some authors consider this population at high risk for the procedure. Anatomic vascular complexity may be an important reason for the high reported rates of periprocedural thromboembolic complications. Transcervical carotid angioplasty and stenting (TCS) with flow reversal avoids aortic arch instrumentation. In this study, we analyzed our experience with TCS in octogenarian patients and compared the results with those of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the same age group in terms of safety.\nThe study included 81 patients, > or =80 years, a retrospective cohort of 45 consecutive patients treated with CEA (January 2002 to January 2005), and a prospective cohort of 36 consecutive patients treated with TCS with protective flow reversal (January 2005 to January 2007). Patients were considered symptomatic according to the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) criteria. Stenting indication was established on the SAPPHIRE criteria. General anesthesia was used in patients undergoing CEA, and local anesthesia in those receiving TCS. Primary endpoints were: stroke, death, or acute myocardial infarction within 30 days. Secondary endpoints were peripheral nerve paralysis and cervical hematoma. Statistical significance for between-group differences was assessed by Pearson chi(2) or Fisher exact test, and Student t test. A P value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. Follow-up was limited to 30 days.\nBaseline epidemiological characteristics and revascularization indications were similar between both groups. Mean age was significantly higher in the TCS group (83.5 +/- 3.35) than the CEA group (81.7 +/- 1.55) (P = .004). Percentage of symptomatic lesions was similar: 30.6% in TCS vs 44.4% in CEA (P = .2). Comorbid conditions (respiratory or cardiac) were more frequent in TCS group (61.6% vs 26.6%; P = .002). There were no significant differences between groups for the primary endpoints: 4.4% (one stroke, one acute myocardial infarction) for CEA vs 0% for TCS (P = .5). Among CEA patients, there were two peripheral nerve palsies (4.4%) and one cervical hematoma (2.2%); there were no such complications with TCS (P = .5 and P = 1, respectively). In one asymptomatic TCS patient, Doppler study at 24 hours following the procedure showed a common carotid artery dissection, which was treated by a common carotid to internal carotid bypass.\nIn this preliminary experience, transcervical carotid angioplasty and stenting with flow reversal for cerebral protection was as safe at short term as carotid endarterectomy in octogenarian patients, who additionally had considerable comorbidity; thus, it may be possible to extend the indications for carotid revascularization in this population. Studies in larger patient series are required to confirm the trends observed in this study.",

    "abstract": "Management using femoral-popliteal vein (FPV) of aortic graft infections, failing aortofemoral bypass, and aortoiliac occlusive disease in young patients with a small aorta is now an accepted therapeutic method and is performed frequently at our institution. A high reintervention rate for FPV graft stenosis has recently been reported. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of FPV graft failure due to stenosis after neoaortoiliac system (NAIS) reconstruction, and to identify risk factors for this complication.\nA review was performed of 240 patients who underwent NAIS reconstruction at our institution between January 1991 and December 2005. All patients were entered into a prospective database and were evaluated for the incidence of vein graft stenosis requiring reintervention, risk factors for stenosis, and the rate and type of reintervention required to assist patency. Patients with occlusion are evaluated and reported, but excluded from detailed analysis. Risk factors assessed included gender, operative features, FPV size (diameter), smoking history, and medical comorbidities.\nOf the 240 NAIS procedures performed during this time period, 11 (4.6%) patients have required 12 graft revisions (one patient required a second intervention) for stenosis using open and endovascular techniques. Over the same time period, graft occlusion occurred in nine patients (3.8%). This provided a primary patency at 2 and 5 years of 87% and 82%, and an assisted primary patency rate of 96% and 94%. Mean time to revision was 23.5 months (range 5.5 to 83.5 months). Median FPV graft size in the nonrevised patients was 7.8 mm (range 4.0 to 11.4 mm), and 6.4 mm (range 4.7 to 8.7 mm) in the revised group (P = .006). Survival analysis revealed small vein graft size (<7.2 mm), coronary artery disease (CAD), and extensive smoking history as independent predictors of time to stenosis (P = .002, .02, .01, respectively), with multivariable analysis confirming these results (P = .002, .06, .012). Patients with CAD combined with small graft size were found to be at especially high risk for stenosis, with 8/36 (22.2%) requiring revision vs 3/184 (1.6%) of patients without both factors (P < .0001).\nFPV graft stenosis requiring revision after NAIS reconstruction is uncommon. Risk factors for stenosis include small graft size, history of CAD, and smoking. All patients merit aggressive counseling for smoking cessation, and patients exhibiting multiple risk factors should undergo close postoperative surveillance for graft stenosis.",

    "abstract": "To compare late patency after direct and crossover bypass in good-risk patients with unilateral iliac occlusive disease not amenable to angioplasty.\nBetween May 1986 and March 1991, 143 patients with unilateral iliac artery occlusive disease and disabling claudication were randomized into two surgical treatment groups, ie, crossover bypass (n = 74) or direct bypass (n = 69). The size of the patient population was calculated to allow detection of a possible 20% difference in patency in favor of direct bypass with a one-sided alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.10. Patients underwent yearly follow-up examinations using color flow duplex scanning with ankle-brachial systolic pressure index measurement. Digital angiography was performed if hemodynamic abnormalities were noted. Median follow-up was 7.4 years. Primary endpoints were primary patency and assisted primary patency estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method with 95% confidence interval. Secondary endpoints were secondary patency and postoperative mortality and morbidity.\nCardiovascular risk factors, preoperative symptoms, iliac lesions TASC class (C in 87 [61%] patients and D in 56 [39%] patients), and superficial femoral artery (SFA) run-off were comparable in the two treatment groups. One patient in the direct bypass group died postoperatively. Primary patency at 5 years was higher in the direct bypass group than in the crossover bypass group (92.7 +/- 6.1% vs 73.2 +/- 10%, P = .001). Assisted primary patency and secondary patency at 5 years were also higher after direct bypass than crossover bypass (92.7 +/- 6.1% vs 84.3 +/- 8.5%, P = .04 and 97.0 +/- 3.0% vs 89.8 +/- 7.1%, P = .03, respectively). Patency at 5 years after crossover bypass was significantly higher in patients presenting no or low-grade SFA stenosis than in patients presenting high-grade (> or =50%) stenosis or occlusion of the SFA (74.0 +/- 12% vs 62.5 +/- 19%, P = .04). In both treatment groups, patency was comparable using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyester grafts. Overall survival was 59.5 +/- 12% at 10 years.\nThis study showed that late patency was higher after direct bypass than crossover bypass in good-risk patients with unilateral iliac occlusive disease not amenable to angioplasty. Crossover bypass should be reserved for high-risk patients with unilateral iliac occlusion not amenable to percutaneous recanalization.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the role of multibranched stent grafts for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair.\nSelf-expanding covered stents were used to connect the caudally directed cuffs of an aortic stent graft with the visceral branches of a TAAA in 22 patients (16 men, 6 women) with a mean age of 76 +/- 7 years. All patients were unfit for open repair, and nine had undergone prior aortic surgery. Customized aortic stent grafts were inserted through surgically exposed femoral (n = 16) or iliac (n = 6) arteries. Covered stents were inserted through surgically exposed brachial arteries. Spinal catheters were used for cerebrospinal fluid pressure drainage in 22 patients and for and spinal anesthesia in 11.\nAll 22 stent grafts and all 81 branches were deployed successfully. Aortic coverage as a percentage of subclavian-to-bifurcation distance was 69% +/- 20%. Mean contrast volume was 203 mL, mean blood loss was 714 mL, and mean hospital stay was 10.9 days. Two patients (9.1%) died perioperatively: one from guidewire injury to a renal arterial branch and the other from a medication error. Serious or potentially serious complications occurred in 9 of 22 patients (41%). There was no paraplegia, renal failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction among the 20 surviving patients. Two patients (9.1%) underwent successful reintervention: one for localized intimal disruption and the other for aortic dissection, type I endoleak, and stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery. One patient has a type II endoleak. Follow-up is >1 month in 19 patients, >6 months in 12, and >12 months in 8. One branch (renal artery) occluded for a 98.75% branch patency rate at 1 month. The other 80 branches remain patent. There are no signs of stent graft migration, component separation, or fracture.\nMultibranched stent graft implantation eliminates aneurysm flow, preserves visceral perfusion, and avoids many of the physiologic stresses associated with other forms of repair. The results support an expanded role for this technique in the treatment of TAAA.",

No scoring system has been shown to have consistent or absolute validity. Of the remaining data, there are no individual or combination of variables that can accurately and consistently predict outcome.\nLittle robust evidence is available on which to base preoperative outcome prediction in patients with ruptured AAA.

    "abstract": "The purpose of vascular disease screening is early identification of atherosclerotic disease and the aim of an ankle-brachial index (ABI) is to identify lower extremity (LE) atherosclerosis as a marker for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, early evidence of atherosclerosis may be present in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) with a normal resting ABI. This study was performed to determine if SFA duplex ultrasound (DUS) could detect more patients with LE atherosclerosis than an ABI; be performed in the same or less time as the ABI measurement; and be associated with similar vascular disease markers as the ABI.\nFrom January through November 2006, 585 patients were screened for peripheral arterial disease. SFA DUS was included in this Institutional Review Board approved program and demographic/ultrasound data were collected prospectively. SFA DUS findings were divided into six categories. Plaque w/o color change or worse and ABI <0.90 or >1.20 were considered to be abnormal. Data were evaluated using decision matrix and logistical regression analysis.\nSensitivity and specificity of SFA DUS using the ABI as the benchmark was 100% and 88%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of ABI was 17% and 100%, respectively, using DUS as the standard. DUS detected atherosclerotic disease in 143 SFAs (93 patients) in which the ipsilateral ABI was normal, and there were no false negative SFA DUS studies. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated the following variables to be significantly and independently associated with an abnormal SFA DUS as well as an abnormal ABI: history of claudication, history of myocardial infarction, and an abnormal carotid DUS. Additional variables (current or past smoker and age >55) were also independently associated with an abnormal SFA DUS but not with an abnormal ABI. Mean time to complete bilateral testing was essentially the same for both tests.\nSFA DUS is an accurate screening tool and can be utilized in screening protocols in place of the time-honored ABI without prolonging the examination. Traditional vascular disease markers that are found in patients with an abnormal ABI are also associated with an abnormal SFA DUS. SFA DUS identifies more patients with early LE atherosclerosis than does ABI without missing significant popliteal/tibial artery occlusive disease. Finally, an abnormal SFA DUS can be used as an indirect marker to identify more potentially at risk patients with CAD.",

    "abstract": "The results of treatment for subclavian vein effort thrombosis were assessed in a series of competitive athletes.\nA retrospective review was conducted of high-performance athletes who underwent multidisciplinary management for venous thoracic outlet syndrome in a specialized referral center. The overall time required to return to athletic activity was assessed with respect to the timing and methods of diagnosis, initial treatment, operative management, and postoperative care.\nBetween January 1997 and January 2007, 32 competitive athletes (29 male and 3 female) were treated for venous thoracic outlet syndrome, of which 31% were in high school, 47% were in college, and 22% were professional. The median age was 20.3 years (range, 16-26 years). Venous duplex ultrasound examination in 21 patients had a diagnostic sensitivity of 71%, and the mean interval between symptoms and definitive venographic diagnosis was 20.2 +/- 5.6 days (range, 1-120 days). Catheter-directed subclavian vein thrombolysis was performed in 26 (81%), with balloon angioplasty in 12 and stent placement in one. Paraclavicular thoracic outlet decompression was performed with circumferential external venolysis alone (56%) or direct axillary-subclavian vein reconstruction (44%), using saphenous vein panel graft bypass (n = 8), reversed saphenous vein graft bypass (n = 3), and saphenous vein patch angioplasty (n = 3). In 19 patients (59%), simultaneous creation of a temporary (12 weeks) adjunctive radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula was done. The mean hospital stay was 5.2 +/- 0.4 days (range, 2-11 days). Seven patients required secondary procedures. Anticoagulation was maintained for 12 weeks. All 32 patients resumed unrestricted use of the upper extremity, with a median interval of 3.5 months between operation and the return to participation in competitive athletics (range, 2-10 months). The overall duration of management from symptoms to full athletic activity was significantly correlated with the time interval from venographic diagnosis to operation (r = 0.820, P < .001) and was longer in patients with persistent symptoms (P < .05) or rethrombosis before referral (P < .01).\nSuccessful outcomes were achieved for the management of effort thrombosis in a series of 32 competitive athletes using a multidisciplinary approach based on (1) early diagnostic venography, thrombolysis, and tertiary referral; (2) paraclavicular thoracic outlet decompression with external venolysis and frequent use of subclavian vein reconstruction; and (3) temporary postoperative anticoagulation, with or without an adjunctive arteriovenous fistula. Optimal outcomes for venous thoracic outlet syndrome depend on early recognition by treating physicians and prompt referral for comprehensive surgical management.",

    "abstract": "Suprarenal fixation is widely used in endovascular aneurysm repair. Numerous small, underpowered studies have concluded that it does not increase the risk of renal impairment compared with infrarenal fixation. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that renal infarction is more common with suprarenal fixation, but the effect on renal function remains unclear.\nElectronic abstract databases, article reference lists, and conference proceedings were searched for series reporting renal function data after suprarenal fixation. There was considerable study heterogeneity with respect to key factors such as pre-existing renal dysfunction and length of follow-up. Authors were contacted to obtain individual patient data for a pooled reanalysis using standardized criteria.\nOf 46 potentially relevant citations, only 11 were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Complete data sets were available for four studies (1065 patients), with a median follow-up of 33 months. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for postoperative renal impairment in the suprarenal fixation and infrarenal fixation groups and compared by the log-rank test. Median time free of renal impairment was 38.5 months in the infrarenal fixation group compared with 32.4 months in the suprarenal fixation group (P = .0038). However, to account for significant methodologic differences, further analysis was required using a Weibull regression model fitted in open Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling (BUGS). The pooled hazard ratio for deterioration of renal function after suprarenal fixation was 0.6 (95% confidence interval, 0.3-10).\nCurrently available data are insufficient to determine the precise effect of suprarenal fixation on medium-term renal function. Conventional Kaplan-Meier analysis of the pooled data set suggested that suprarenal fixation increased the risk of renal dysfunction; however, the effect disappeared when sophisticated statistical modelling was performed to account for study heterogeneity. A randomised controlled trial of suprarenal fixation may resolve this issue.",

    "abstract": "Carotid body tumor (CBT), an extra-adrenal paraganglioma, represents an uncommon entity arising in chemoreceptor tissue located at the carotid bifurcation. Only a few cases have been reported in the literature in the pediatric age group less than 14 years of age, primarily as case reports. Surgical excision is advisable in almost all ages, however, in childhood, it is known to carry risks and difficulties due to the smaller size of the involved anatomical structures. We report an unusual case of a large (50 x 43 x 30 mm) carotid paraganglioma of Shamblin type III in a 13-year-old female, living at high altitude until the age of 9 years. This cervical mass was present, but smaller in size, several years before admission. However, an intense hypoxic stimulus at high altitude for 2 months at the age of 13 years probably induced a fast growing period of the lesion. The tumor was removed en bloc with the involved carotid segments and vascular continuity was restored by means of a common carotid to internal carotid saphenous vein interposition graft. No malignant behavior or regional metastatic spread of the resected mass was demonstrated. Furthermore, no inheritance pattern between family members was confirmed. A clinical update on CBTs in childhood a propos of this case report is undertaken.",

    "abstract": "The American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) classification remains the most widely used risk-stratification system in the world. However, it is not practical in patients undergoing revascularization procedures because most are classified as ASA III. We hypothesized that ASA III patients can be subdivided into two subgroups, ASA IIIA and ASA IIIB, simply based on their preoperative functional capacity measured in metabolic equivalents (METS) of <4 or > or =4, which would allow the largest group of vascular surgery patients to be appropriately subgrouped for their predicted early and late postoperative morbidity and mortality.\nAll charts of 482 patients (99% men) who underwent revascularization for disabling claudication or critical limb ischemia between June 2001 and October 2006 were reviewed for demographics, comorbidities, operative and interventional details, postoperative complications, and outcomes defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. Preoperative functional capacity information was obtained from the anesthesia records in the electronic charts.\nThere were 35 patients (7%) in ASA II, 371 patients (77%) in ASA III (45% in ASA IIIA, 32% in ASA IIIB) and 76 patients (16%) in ASA IV.

    "abstract": "Renal ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury (IRI) is an important mechanism of acute renal failure (ARF) and a crucial factor of tissue damage during vascular surgery. IR may lead to tissue destruction and influence the early and long-term outcome of organs. The anti-anginal medication trimetazidine (TMZ) is a drug, the protective effects of which have been already assessed during cold preservation and warm ischemia (WI). The objective of this dose-effect study was to assess the role of TMZ in severe renal WI model.\nWe have used an established WI pig kidney model associated with a uninephrectomy condition and studied the dose-dependent role of TMZ (1, 5, and 10 mg/Kg, i.v. for 24 hours before WI) against deleterious effects of WI (60 minutes of WI followed by reperfusion) compared with sham-operated (control) and uninephrectomized animals (unif). Direct effect of TMZ was determined using different variables: renal function (creatinine clearance; C(cr)) and indirectly, the consequences on inflammation (cells infiltration), rate of apoptosis, fibrosis development, and renal epithelial cells change into myofibroblast, which defined epithelial to mesenchymal transition (alpha-smooth muscle actin [alpha-SMA] and vimentin expression).\nTMZ (5 or 10 mg/Kg) significantly increased C(cr) and reduced the inflammatory response prevalent in ischemic kidney injury and rate of apoptosis expression. In addition, the limitation of initial IRI was correlated with an earlier and greater expression of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), which is a hypoxia marker during kidney regeneration. A reduction of the tubulointerstitial development of fibrosis and a limitation of the alpha-smooth muscle actin expression (alpha-SMA) was observed with TMZ treatment. At 3 months, vimentin expression was increased in WI groups without TMZ or low TMZ dose treatment compared with 5 or 10 mg/Kg treated groups.\nCollectively, these data suggest that TMZ made the warm ischemic kidneys more resistant to the deleterious impact of a single episode of IR and could have a role in preserving the ischemic kidney from long-term damage.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesized that a subgroup of patients with frank stroke due to sudden occlusion of the internal carotid artery could safely undergo surgery to restore carotid patency and to rescue brain tissue not yet irreversibly damaged if current stroke diagnostic methods were applied.\nFrom November 1997 to March 2007, 1810 patients underwent carotid endarterectomy of the internal carotid artery for occlusive disease at our department. Within the same period, 5369 patients were examined at our stroke unit, and 502 from this cohort underwent internal carotid artery reconstruction. A subgroup of 35 patients (28 men, 7 women; mean age, 61 +/- 10 years) underwent urgent surgical revascularization due to an acute internal carotid artery occlusion < or =72 hours (mean 25 +/- 17 hours) after the onset of stroke symptoms and < or =36 hours (mean 16 +/- 10 hours) after admission to our stroke unit. Our diagnostic workup consisted of extracranial intracranial duplex sonography, cerebral computed tomography, digital subtraction angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography, including diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging, to discriminate between viable and irreversibly damaged brain tissue. The study excluded patients who presented an impaired level of consciousness, occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery, occlusion of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery, or infarction more than one-third of the territory perfused by the middle cerebral artery. Imaging showed signs of recent ischemic infarction in all 35 cases. On admission, eight patients (23%) scored 0 to 2 points and 27 (77%) scored 3 to 5 points in Rankin scale.\nConfirmed by postoperative Doppler and duplex sonography at discharge, internal carotid artery patency could be achieved in 30 of 35 cases (86%). Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in two patients (6%) and reinfarction in another two (6%). Two patients died during their hospital stay (30-day mortality, 6%). Compared with the preoperative neurologic status, rates of clinical improvement (> or =1 point in Rankin scale), stability, and deterioration were 57%, 31%, and 6%, respectively.\nRestoration of blood flow in an acutely occluded internal carotid artery can only be achieved in the acute stage. Our pilot study demonstrated that a thorough diagnostic workup allows selection of patients who may benefit from urgent revascularization of acute internal carotid artery occlusion in the stage of an acute stroke. A prospective randomized multicenter trial comparing surgery with conservative medical treatment is needed.",

    "abstract": "Widespread application of infrarenal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has resulted in a proportionate increase in open juxtarenal aortic aneurysm (JAA) repairs. Fenestrated endograft technology for JAA is developing rapidly, but only limited outcomes are known. The aim of this study was to review our open JAA experience in an era of fenestrated endograft technology, identify factors associated with increased surgical risk, determine early and midterm outcome, and provide a basis for comparison for future endovascular procedures.\nData from 126 consecutive patients who underwent elective JAA repair requiring suprarenal aortic clamping from 2001 to 2006 were analyzed retrospectively. Electronic medical chart reviews were used to record 30-day complication rates. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors associated with surgical morbidity. Mail-out questionnaires and telephone surveys were conducted to determine long-term follow-up.\nNinety-eight males and 28 females (median age 74 years; range 55 to 93) were included in the study. Preoperative risk factors included: coronary artery disease (CAD) 58%, pulmonary disease 41%, renal insufficiency (serum creatinine [Cr] > 1.5mg/dL) 17%, and diabetes 9%. Fifteen patients underwent concomitant renal artery revascularization. Mean operative time was 319 minutes (range 91 to 648). Thirty-day mortality was 1/126 (0.8%). Median hospital length of stay was 7 days (range 3 to 85); median intensive care unit length of stay was 2 days (1 to 64). Complications included renal insufficiency (Cr increase > 0.5 mg/dL) in 22 (18%), cardiac in 17 (13%), and pulmonary in 14 (11%). Five patients required temporary hemodialysis; only one after hospital dismissal. Mean follow-up was 48 months (range 9-80). On multivariate analysis, age > or = 78 years (P = .001), male gender (P = .04), hypertension (P =.01), previous myocardial infarction (P = .047), and diabetes (P =.009) were predictive of cardiac complications. Renal artery revascularization (P = .01) and prior MI (P = .04) were multivariate predictors of pulmonary complications. Both prolonged operative (> or =351 minutes, P = .02) and renal ischemia (> or =23 minutes, P =.004) times predicted postoperative renal insufficiency. One, 3, and 5-year cumulative survival rates were 93.9%, 78.3%, and 63.8%, respectively and were not significantly different than an age- and gender-matched sample of the US population (P = .16). Mortality was not predicted by any specific risk factors.\nOpen surgical repair of JAA is associated with low mortality and remains the gold standard. Although 18% had renal complications, only one patient had permanent renal failure. Patients with a combination of physiologic and anatomic risk factors identified on multivariate analysis may benefit from fenestrated endograft repair.",

The draft report was submitted to and discussed by a working group of 12 members nominated by relevant medical societies. The amended report was submitted to a multidisciplinary group of 12 peer reviewers for comment.\nEndovascular stent grafting (ESG) repair for lesions of the thoracic aorta, including aneurysms, dissections, and aortic isthmus ruptures, is probably beneficial in terms of operative mortality and severe morbidity, with an incidence of paraplegia of 2.1% (range 0%-7%) for ESG vs 5% (range, 3%-15%) for surgery, provided that there is a rigorous medium-term assessment and that anatomic factors are favorable. A proximal neck length of at least 2 cm is needed to insert the stent graft. Indications for ESG in thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection are similar to those for surgery. Endovascular stent grafting is particularly appropriate in patients with multiple traumas to the thoracic aorta in whom concomitant lesions are a contraindication to open surgery. Endovascular stent graft repair can only be done in public or private centers with expertise in both endovascular and surgical procedures and with adequate technical facilities. Patients should be informed of the advantages and drawbacks of both methods. A multidisciplinary discussion should address risks of converting to open surgery and possible need for a cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients should be monitored annually by computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging and plain radiographs because long-term results are uncertain (possible stent graft deterioration, onset of aortic disease). They should be told of the need for surveillance and possible further treatment.\nA prospective registry of all thoracic aorta procedures (endovascular treatment, open surgery, thoracic ESG plus extra-anatomic bypass) needs to be set up. All practitioners and stent graft manufacturers should contribute to this registry. It should include information on patient monitoring in order to (1) select patients who could be treated by ESG repair, (2) assess the feasibility of a randomized controlled study comparing ESG and surgery, (3) assess the medium-term outcome of different devices, and (4) obtain a better understanding of the health economics aspects.",

Endovascular stent grafting is particularly appropriate in patients with multiple traumas to the thoracic aorta in whom concomitant lesions are a contraindication to open surgery. Endovascular stent graft repair can only be done in public or private centers with expertise in both endovascular and surgical procedures and with adequate technical facilities. Patients should be informed of the advantages and drawbacks of both methods. A multidisciplinary discussion should address risks of converting to open surgery and possible need for a cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients should be monitored annually by computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging and plain radiographs because long-term results are uncertain (possible stent graft deterioration, onset of aortic disease). They should be told of the need for surveillance and possible further treatment.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular stenting has emerged as an alternative to open repair in patients requiring surgery for thoracic aortic pathology. A number of comparative series have been published but, to date, there has been no meta-analysis comparing outcomes following stenting as opposed to open surgery.\nElectronic abstract databases and conference proceedings were searched to identify relevant series. Pooled odds ratios were calculated using random effects models for perioperative mortality, neurological injury, and major reintervention.\nThe search identified 17 eligible series, totaling 1109 patients (538 stenting). Stenting was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (pooled odds ratio 0.36; 95% CI 0.228-0.578; P < .0001) and major neurological injury (pooled odds ratio 0.39; 95% CI 0.25-0.62; P = .0001). There was no difference in the major reintervention rate (pooled odds ratio 0.91; 95% CI 0.610-1.619). There was a reduction in hospital and critical care stay although there was evidence of heterogeneity and bias with respect to these outcomes. Subgroup analyses suggested that endovascular repair reduced mortality (pooled odds ratio 0.25; 95% CI 0.09-0.66) and neurological morbidity (pooled odds ratio 0.28; 95% CI 0.13-0.61) in stable patients undergoing repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms. There was no effect on mortality in patients with thoracic aortic trauma but neurological injury was reduced (pooled odds ratio 0.17; 95% CI 0.03-1.03). Endovascular repair did not confer any apparent benefit over open surgery in patients with thoracic aortic rupture.\nEndovascular thoracic aortic repair reduces perioperative mortality and neurological morbidity in patients with descending thoracic aortic aneurysms. There may be less benefit in other thoracic aortic conditions.",

The outcome measures were 30-day mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, hospital stay, blood loss, and operative time.\nTwenty-three studies were identified. Of these, only one was a randomized controlled trial, which is now halted. The total number of patients in the pooled data was 7040 (730 emergency endovascular aneurysm repair [eEVAR]). Emergency EVAR was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (pooled odds ratio 0.624; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.518 to 0.752; P < .0001).

    "abstract": "The management of penetrating subclavian artery injuries poses a formidable surgical challenge. The feasibility of stent graft repair is already established. General use of this modality is not widely accepted due to concerns regarding the long-term outcome in a generally young patient population. We review our stent graft experience to examine long-term outcomes.\nAll patients with penetrating subclavian artery injuries were evaluated for stent graft repair. Patients were excluded when hemodynamically unstable or unsuitable on other clinical and angiographic grounds. Patients were followed prospectively for early (<30 days) and late (>30 days) complications. Clinical and telephone evaluation, Doppler pressures, duplex Doppler, and angiography (when indicated), were used to asses patients at follow-up. Outcomes were recorded as technical success of procedure, graft patency, arm claudication, limb loss, the need for open surgical repair, the presence or absence of other complications, and death.\nFifty-seven patients underwent stent graft treatment during the 10-year period. Mean age was 34, and 91% were men. There were 53 stab wounds and four gunshot injuries. Pathology included false aneurysms (n = 42), arteriovenous fistula (n = 12), and three arterial occlusions. Early complications: One patient (2%) had a femoral puncture site injury which was managed with open surgical repair. One patient died early due to multiple organ failure related to concomitant injuries. Three patients (5%) presented with graft occlusion and nonlimb threatening ischemia in the first week after treatment. All three patients were managed successfully with a second endovascular intervention. Late complications: Twenty-five (44%) of the 57 patients with subclavian artery injuries were followed-up with a mean duration of 48 months. Two patients died as a result of fatal stab wounds months after their first injuries. Five patients (20%) and three patients (12%) presented with angiographically significant stenosis and occlusions, respectively. The stenotic lesions were successfully managed with endovascular intervention, and the occluded lesions were managed conservatively. No patient experienced life or limb loss or any incapacitating symptoms at the end of the study period. There was no need for conversion to open surgery.\nThis study has reaffirmed the feasibility and safety of stent graft repair in treating stable patients with selected penetrating subclavian artery injuries. The results of this study also confirmed acceptable long-term follow-up without any limb or life threatening complications. We conclude that endovascular repair should be considered the first choice of treatment in stable patients with subclavian artery injuries.",

    "abstract": "This clinical study evaluated prospectively adverse events immediately following ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) for the treatment of lower extremity venous valvular insufficiency. Incidence of side effects associated with carbon dioxide (CO(2)) foam was compared with a historical control using air-based foam. The literature on the subject was reviewed.\nVital signs were monitored during and immediately after UGFS, and adverse events were recorded for 24 hours following the procedure. The air-based foam group had 49 patients: 44 women and 5 men. The CO(2)-based foam group had 128 patients: 115 women and 13 men. CEAP class was C2EpAsPr, describing varicose veins, primary etiology, and saphenous reflux. UGFS followed thermal ablation of the great saphenous vein. Foam was prepared using the three-way tap technique to mix gas with 1% polidocanol in a 4:1 ratio. Segments of the great and small saphenous veins and their tributaries were treated with UGFS. Foam volumes injected were 27 +/- 10 (SD) (6-46 range) and 25 +/- 12 (6-57 range) mL for air- and CO(2)-based foams respectively (P = .39). Incidence of adverse events was compared by chi(2) statistics. Vital signs were compared by paired t test.\nDuring the procedure, the average heart rate decreased by less than 5 bpm for both groups (P < .001), and blood pressure decreased by less than 3 mm Hg in the CO(2) group (P < .02). Respiratory rate, electrocardiogram, and pulse oxymetry did not change significantly in both air- and CO(2)-foam series (P > .05). Visual disturbances were experienced by 3.1% (4/128) and 8.2% (4/49) patients in the CO(2) and air groups respectively (P = .15). Respiratory difficulties or circumoral paresthesia each occurred in 0.8% (n = 1) of the CO(2) patients. Incidence of chest tightness (3.1% vs 18%), dry cough (1.6% vs 16%), or dizziness (3.1% vs 12%) were significantly lower in the CO(2) vs air groups (P < .02). Nausea occurred in 2% and 4% of the CO(2) and air-based foam groups (P = .53). Overall, the proportion of patients describing side effects decreased from 39% (19/49) to 11% (14/128) as CO(2) replaced air for foam preparation (P < .001). Similar findings were described in the literature of air-based foam but data on the use of physiological gas were rare.\nSide effects decreased significantly if CO(2) rather than air was employed to make the sclerosing foam for chemical ablation of superficial veins of the lower extremity.",

We report a case of a 70-year-old male status post angioplasty and stenting of bilateral iliac arteries for occlusive disease who subsequently underwent EVAR for a rapidly expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). One month after the placement of the endograft, it was discovered that the previously placed Wallstent had been dislodged during the endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Minimally invasive retrieval using an Amplatz Goose Neck Snare was successful in recovering the stent.

    "abstract": "Various strategies have been used to combat arterial access limitations encountered during thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Most require retroperitoneal dissection or aggressive angioplasty techniques that can lead to devastating complications. We describe a novel technique using an \"internal endoconduit.\" Deployment of an iliac stent graft across the prohibitively stenotic area, followed by angioplasty and controlled rupture of the iliac artery, allows for safe passage of the delivery sheath. Adverse events associated with decreased pelvic perfusion or hemorrhage from iliac artery rupture are theoretically possible but have not been observed. Faced with unfavorable iliac anatomy, we use internal endoconduits rather than retroperitoneal access procedures and believe their use will increase the number of procedures that will be able to be performed through femoral access and substantially reduce the frequency of access-related complications.",

The autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) has been the gold standard since the introduction of the Brecia-Cimino fistula in 1966 and is echoed in the current Kidney Disease Outcomes and Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines. The purpose of this study is to determine the natural history of AVF in patients requiring first-time permanent access in a large academic vascular surgery practice.\nWe performed a retrospective review of patients undergoing new access creation from January 1, 2005 to June 30, 2005. The study group consisted of patients with no prior permanent access that underwent AVF creation. Categorical data was compared using chi2 analysis, nominal data was compared using Student t-test, and patency was determined by Kaplan-Meier curves.\nDuring the 6-month period, there were 80 first time AVF creations. The majority of patients were male (69%), African American (55%), and a history of diabetes (55%) and hypertension (96%). Seventy-five percent of patients were already undergoing hemodialysis via catheter access. Seventy-six percent of patients underwent preoperative vein mapping with a mean vein diameter of 3.1 mm. Twenty-six radiocephalic AVF (RCAVF) and 54 brachiocephalic AVF (BCAVF) were created with a mean follow-up of 278 days. At the end of follow-up, 38 (48%) AVF were being used for hemodialysis and only nine (11%) matured without the need for additional intervention. Mean time for AVF maturation was 146 days. Thirty AVF (37%) were abandoned, 16 (20%) of which were primary failures. Mean time to abandonment was 162 days. Twelve (15%) AVF remained patent but were never cannulated. The intervention rate was 1.33 interventions/patient/year and 75% of interventions were percutaneous. Kaplan-Meier analysis determined primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency was 36% +/- 8.3, 55% +/- 6.5, and 55% +/- 6.5 at 1 year, respectively. Cumulative functional patency was 63% at 1 year.\nIn patients receiving a first time permanent access, we found that the majority were AVF and they resulted in low primary patency rates at 1 year and long maturation times. KDOQI encourages AVF creation in order to increase AVF use for dialysis, but the strategy of simply increasing the number being created may not lead to the desired result and potentially lead to an increase in catheter dependence.",

    "abstract": "Although the performance of basilic vein transpositions for dialysis access is well established, the utility and patency rates of brachial vein transpositions are poorly characterized. The brachial vein is being used increasingly as an alternative vein for transposition in an effort to increase the percentage of autogenous fistula utilization. The purpose of this study was to review a single-center comparative experience with these fistulas.\nA retrospective chart review was performed on 59 patients who received basilic and brachial vein transpositions between January 2000 and December 2006. Patient demographics, comorbidities, mortality, and morbidity were evaluated. Patency rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis.\nOf 59 vein transpositions, there were 42 basilic (71%) and 17 brachial (29%). The 30-day mortality was 0%. Maturation rates were 74% for basilic vein transpositions and 47% for brachial (P = .049). The mean time to maturation was 11.9 +/- 8.8 weeks. Primary patency rates at 12 months were 50% for basilic vein transpositions vs 40% for brachial (P = .115). The mean vein size was 4.9 +/- 0.9 mm. The mean basilic vein transposition diameter of 4.9 +/- 1.0 mm and brachial vein transposition diameter of 5.0 +/- 0.8 mm were not significant (P = .39).\nDespite a higher rate of initial maturation in basilic vein transpositions, brachial and basilic vein transpositions had comparable patency rates at 12 months. These preliminary results require further follow-up and a larger cohort of patients for confirmation. Broader use of the brachial vein transposition for dialysis appears justified and can increase the overall percentage of autogenous fistula placement.",

    "abstract": "The current study was conducted to demonstrate that catheter-directed thrombolysis for upper and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis is equally safe in patients with and without cancer.\nA retrospective cohort of consecutive patients with acute iliofemoral or brachiosubclavian deep vein thrombosis treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis was identified. Demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between patients with cancer and without cancer.\nCatheter-directed thrombolysis was used to treat 202 limbs in 178 patients (75 limbs in 61 cancer patients and 127 limbs in 117 patients without cancer). The mean treatment duration for patients with cancer (29.7 +/- 21.2 hours) and without cancer (28.8 +/- 22.2 hours) was similar (P = .7774). Catheter-directed thrombolysis achieved grade III clot lysis in a similar proportion of cancer patients (50 of 75 limbs, 66.7%) and patients without cancer (82 of 127 limbs, 64.6%; P = .7619). Grade II clot lysis also was achieved in equal numbers of patients with (20 of 75 limbs, 26.7%) and without cancer (34 of 127 limbs, 26.8%; P = .9872). Three cancer patients (4.9%) and four noncancer patients (3.4%) experienced major bleeding during catheter-directed thrombolysis (P = .6924). Pulmonary embolism occurred in 1.6% (1 of 61) of cancer patients and in 1.7% (2 of 117) of patients without cancer (P = .9999) during catheter-directed thrombolysis. Patients aged > or =70 years had an increased risk of major bleeding.\nPercutaneous catheter-directed thrombolysis is equally safe for patients with and without cancer who have acute symptomatic deep vein thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Iliac vein occlusive disease leads to 73% of rethrombosis that occurs after venous thrombectomy when left untreated. The goal of this study is to present our long-term results of stenting of iliocaval occlusive lesions persisting after surgical venous thrombectomy.\nFrom November 1995 to April 2007, 29 patients (19 women), with a median age of 38 years, had surgical venous thrombectomy with creation of an arteriovenous fistula and angioplasty and stenting. All were admitted for acute (<10 days) deep venous thrombosis (DVT) involving the iliocaval segment, of which eight had concomitant acute pulmonary embolism. Six patients had a history of DVT (2 with previous venous thrombectomy), two were pregnant, and three had postpartum DVT. No patients had short- or mid-term life-threatening factors. The underlying lesion was left iliocaval compression (May-Thurner syndrome) in 22 patients, chronic left common iliac vein occlusion in 3, residual clot in 3, and compression of the left external iliac vein by the left internal iliac artery in 1.\nNeither perioperative death nor pulmonary embolism occurred. Four early complications occurred after stenting (13.8%). Median hospital length of stay was 8 days (range, 5-22 days). Median follow-up was 63 months (range, 2-137 months). Three late complications occurred (10.3 %): one rethrombosis due to stent crushing during pregnancy and two restenosis, which were treated by iterative stenting. At the end of the follow-up, the median venous clinical severity score was 3 (range 1-12) and the venous disability score was 1 (range 0-2). Primary, assisted primary and secondary patency rates were, respectively, 79%, 86%, and 86% at 12, 60, and 120 months. Patients with patent iliocaval segments had significantly fewer infrainguinal obstructive lesions (4% vs 50%) and a higher rate of valvular competence (76% vs 0%) than those who experienced rethrombosis. Venous scores were also worse in patients with rethrombosis.\nStenting is a safe, efficient, and durable technique to treat occlusive iliocaval disease after venous thrombectomy. Its use can prevent most of the rethrombosis that occurs after venous thrombectomy without major adverse effects.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair (EVR) is emerging as first-line treatment for patients with superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome of benign etiology, but data on its durability remain scarce. The aims of this study were to assess the efficacy and durability of EVR and compare results of EVR with open surgical reconstruction (OSR).\nData from 70 consecutive patients undergoing treatment for benign SVC syndrome between November 1983 and November 2006 were retrospectively reviewed.\nThere were 30 males and 40 females (mean age, 41 years; range, 5-75 years). Etiology included indwelling catheters or pacemaker wires in 35 patients, mediastinal fibrosis in 31, idiopathic thrombosis in 2, hypercoagulable disorder in 1, and postsurgical thrombosis in 1. In 42 patients, OSR was done through a median sternotomy: repair was with spiral saphenous vein in 22, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) in 13, femoral vein grafts in 6, and human allograft in 1. Fifteen OSRs followed failed EVR interventions. EVR was attempted in 32 patients and was successful in 28 (88%): 19 had stenting, 14 had percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA), 2 had thrombolytic therapy with PTA, and 3 had stenting. All four technical failures subsequently underwent OSR. There were no early deaths in either group. Periprocedural morbidity was 19% after OSR and 4% in the EVR group. Six early surgical graft failures were successfully treated with surgical revision; one restenosis after EVR was restented. During a mean follow-up of 4.1 years (range, 0.1-17.5 years) after OSR, 11 patients underwent 18 secondary interventions. Mean follow-up after EVR was 2.2 years (range, 0.2-6.4 years), and nine patients underwent 21 secondary EVR interventions. Primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates of surgical bypass grafts were, respectively, 45%, 68%, and 75% at 3 and 5 years. Primary, assisted primary and secondary patency rates after EVR were 44%, 96%, and 96% at 3 years. Assisted primary patency was significantly higher in vein grafts than in ePTFE grafts (P = .05). Assisted primary and secondary patency was significantly higher in patients undergoing stenting compared with PTA (P = .02). At last follow-up, 93% of patients in both OSR and EVR groups had significant relief from symptoms.\nOSR of benign SVC syndrome is effective, with durable long-term relief from symptoms. EVR is less invasive but equally effective in the mid-term, albeit at the cost of multiple secondary interventions, and is an appropriate primary treatment for benign SVC syndrome. OSR remains an excellent choice for patients who are not suitable for EVR or in whom the EVR fails.",

    "abstract": "Since publication of previous meta-analyses comparing endovascular and surgical treatment of patients with carotid artery stenosis, two further large-scale trials have been conducted, almost doubling the number of patients available for analysis. Therefore, it is justified to update these meta-analyses.\nRelevant trials were identified by a search of the literature using an electronic database. Trials with a nonrandomized patient allocation were not included. We focused on events within 30 days after intervention and made two sets of analysis: one with all trials and one with large trials exclusively including symptomatic patients.\nOnly Endart\u00e9rectomie Versus Angioplastie chez les patients ayant une St\u00e9nose carotide Symptomatique Serr\u00e9e (EVA3S) and Stent-Supported Percutaneous Angioplasty of the Carotid Artery versus Endarterectomy (SPACE) were identified to be included in the updated meta-analysis. In total, 2985 patients were included in eight trials of which 89% were symptomatic. In contrast to previous analyses, this meta-analysis found a significant difference between the odds ratios of any stroke or death within 30 days after treatment with a disadvantage of endovascular treatment when analysing all trials (odds ratio [OR], 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.83; P = .024). Significant heterogeneity was found for this analysis (P = .03). The increase of the odds of suffering from disabling stroke or death in the endovascular compared with the surgical group was not significant in the analysis of all trials (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.92-2.04; P = .12); no heterogeneity was found for this analysis (P = .27). In the analysis of the large trials with symptomatic patients, the OR for the endpoint any stroke or death was 1.29 (95% CI 0.94-1.76; P = .11); with a hint for heterogeneity (P = .10). For the endpoint disabling stroke or death, the OR was 1.33 (95% CI 0.89-1.93; P =.17) without any heterogeneity (P = .58).\nThe expressiveness of this meta-analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of some tests. The main result is that surgical treatment still remains the gold standard for treatment of patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, who do not have an increased surgical risk. Carotid artery stenting is neither safer than nor as safe as carotid endarterectomy in large clinical trials when short-term stroke and death rates are taken into account. Further recruitment into ongoing randomized trials is strongly recommended.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for treating carotid artery stenosis. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical trials to date comparing these two procedures to determine their relative safety and efficacy.\nSearches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, and EMBASE identified two cohort studies and eight randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CEA and CAS. Meta-analysis was performed for the primary outcome of 30-day stroke or death, using an intention-to-treat analysis. Between-trial heterogeneity was assessed using the chi2 test, and fixed-effects models were used to pool estimates in the absence of heterogeneity. Meta-regression was conducted to investigate potential effect differences by patient, intervention, and trial characteristics. To evaluate the effect of study design and inclusion criteria, sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed.\nTen trials encompassing 3580 patients were analyzed. Patients who underwent CAS had a higher risk of 30-day stroke/death relative to patients who underwent CEA (risk ratio [RR], 1.30; 95% CI, 1.01-1.67). Meta-analysis and meta-regression demonstrated no between-trial heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis of only RCTs showed similar higher risk for stroke/death (RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.06-1.79) in CAS patients. Subgroup analysis of trials enrolling only symptomatic patients showed higher risk of 30-day stroke/death (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.18-2.25), but trials enrolling both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients showed no significant differences (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.59-1.35).\nMeta-analysis of trials to date shows CAS is associated with higher 30-day risk of stroke/death compared with CEA. Thus, for the patient at average surgical risk, the role of CAS is unproven, especially for symptomatic patients. And for the patient at high surgical risk, the role of any intervention is uncertain in the setting of competing comorbidities. The results of ongoing clinical trials in this area will likely provide additional evidence to support treatment choices for carotid artery stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Almost a third of patients who undergo peripheral bypass procedures do not have suitable veins, making the use of prosthetic materials necessary. Prosthetic materials can cause platelet adhesion and activation of the coagulation cascade on the graft. One potential strategy to reduce this thrombogenicity is to covalently bind heparin to the endoluminal surface of grafts. This human in vivo study examined systemic effects of the endoluminal heparin and addressed whether graft implantation results in (1) a measurable reduction of systemic markers of hemostasis activation compared with control grafts and (2) antibody formation against heparin, potentially responsible for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).\nThe study included 20 patients undergoing femoropopliteal bypass grafting, of whom 10 received a standard Gore-Tex Thin Walled Stretch Vascular Graft (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) and 10 received a heparin-bonded expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft (Gore-Tex Propaten Vascular Graft). Blood samples were drawn before and directly after the operation and at days 1, 3, 5, and week 6 after surgery. Established markers of in vivo activation of platelets and blood coagulation (prothrombin fragment 1+2, fibrinopeptide A, soluble glycoprotein V, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, and D-dimers) were measured using standard commercially available techniques. Antiplatelet factor 4/heparin antibody titers were measured using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and platelet counts were determined.\nNo statistical differences were observed in any of the markers of in vivo activation of platelets and blood coagulation between patients receiving Propaten or control ePTFE. Moreover, no antibodies against heparin could be demonstrated up to 6 weeks after implantation.\nNo measurable effect of heparin immobilization on systemic markers of hemostasis was found using a heparin-bonded ePTFE graft in vivo. Also, no antibodies against heparin could be detected up to 6 weeks after implantation.",

    "abstract": "We studied whether the measurement of skin perfusion pressure (SPP) is useful for evaluating ischemic limbs and predicting wound healing.\nTwo hundred eleven patients (age range, 45 to 90 years; mean age, 69.6 +/- 9.2 years; 170 men and 41 women), 403 limbs with arteriosclerosis obliterans, were included in this study. Half of the patients had diabetes or were receiving dialysis or both.\nSignificant correlations were found between SPP and ankle blood pressure (ABP), SPP and toe blood pressure (TBP), and SPP and the transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tcPO2) (P < .0001, r = 0.75; P < .0001, r = 0.85; P < .0001, r = 0.62; respectively). In 94 limbs with ulcer or gangrene, wound healing was predicted by the SPP. The mean SPP (mean +/- SD) in the healed-wound group (25 limbs, 48 +/- 20 mm Hg) was greater than that in the unhealed-wound group (69 limbs, 23 +/- 11 mm Hg) (P <.001). According to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the cut-off value of SPP was 40 mm Hg (sensitivity, 72%; specificity, 88%). Furthermore, we studied whether the combination of SPP and another measurement could predict wound healing more accurately than could any single variable. There was a strong correlation between SPP, TBP, and the healing rate (P < .001, r = 0.69) and healing could be accurately predicted if the SPP was greater than 40 mm Hg and if the TBP was greater than 30 mm Hg.\nOur results suggest that measurement of SPP is an objective method for assessing the severity of peripheral arterial disease or for predicting wound healing.",

Reasons for referral were severe claudication in six patients (50%), ischemic rest pain in four (33.3%), and minor tissue loss in two (16.7%). Three patients (25%) had chronic renal failure and were on dialysis. Follow-up was performed in all 12 patients.\nTechnical success was 91.7% because one patient had a residual stenosis >30% after stent placement and balloon postdilation owing to severe calcification of the aorta. However, clinical and immediate hemodynamic success was achieved in all 12 patients (100%). The preprocedural mean resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) values of 0.56 +/- 0.13 at the right side and 0.59 +/- 0.15 at the left were increased to 0.97 +/- 0.04 and 0.95 +/- 0.06, respectively, after treatment (P < .01). At the end of the mean follow-up of 18.3 months (range, 6-37 months), the primary clinical and hemodynamic patency was 91.7% +/- 7.98%, and the mean resting ABI values were 0.96 +/- 0.04 for the right and 0.92 +/- 0.1 for the left side (P < .01 compared with preinterventional values). None of the patients in the study underwent reintervention. An access-related groin hematoma developed in one patient, but no other major or minor complications occurred. One patient died 8 months after the procedure of chronic renal failure complications.\nPrimary stenting is feasible, safe, and effective for the whole spectrum of aortic occlusive disease. Especially for patients with infrarenal aortic stenoses, it is recommended as the first-line treatment and should be considered as a viable alternative to surgery for total aortoiliac occlusions.",

Participants were randomly allocated to either a control PAD-IC group (CPAD-IC) (n = 11) that received standard medical therapy and a treatment PAD-IC group (TPAD-IC) (n = 10), which also took part in a 12-month supervised exercise program. A further group of participants (n = 11) free of PAD (ABI >0.9) and who were non-regular exercisers were recruited from the community to act as age and mass matched controls (CON). Lower limb mobility was determined via two-dimensional video motion analysis. A graded treadmill test was used to assess walking performance and peak physiological responses to exercise. Physical activity levels were measured via a 7-day pedometer recording. Differences between groups were analyzed via repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).\nThe 12-month supervised exercise program had no significant effect on lower limb mobility, peak physiological responses, or physical activity levels in TPAD-IC compared with CPAD-IC participants. However, the TPAD-IC participants demonstrated significantly greater walking performance (171% improvement in pain free walking time and 120% improvement in maximal walking time compared with baseline).\nThe results of this study confirm that a 12-month supervised exercise program will result in improved walking performance, but does not have an impact on lower limb mobility, peak physiological responses, or physical activity levels of PAD-IC patients.",

    "abstract": "Risk factors for atherosclerosis have limited ability to identify persons at high risk of coronary heart disease. Assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis in peripheral arteries might improve this limitation. We studied the relationship between atherosclerotic plaques in peripheral arteries, coronary plaques, and coronary death.\nPredefined segments from the left anterior descending coronary artery, the right coronary artery, bilateral carotid, and superficial femoral arteries (SFA) were obtained from 100 autopsies (20-82 years, 30 females, 27 coronary deaths). Based on microscopic examination of 4756 sections, the extension of atherosclerosis (plaque burden) and the largest plaque area in each segment were quantified.\nPlaque burden in all arteries increased with age and was larger in coronary death (P < .05). SFA plaques occurred later than coronary and carotid plaques. When SFA plaque had developed, coronary plaque was also present. SFA plaque (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: 7.07 [2.40-20.81]), but not carotid plaque, was significantly associated with coronary death, also after age and gender adjustment (21.25 [5.02-89.97]). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the identification of coronary death individuals was 0.72 (95% confidence interval: 0.62-0.83) for coronary plaque, and 0.80 (0.72-0.89) for SFA plaque (age and gender adjusted).\nAtherosclerosis develops slower in SFA compared with coronary and carotid arteries. In persons with plaque in the SFA, plaque is always present in the coronary arteries. In younger persons, the presence of SFA plaque indicates a generalized susceptibility to atherosclerosis and vulnerability to coronary death.",

    "abstract": "Informed consent discussions for elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair should reflect appropriate risks of the open or endovascular repair (EVAR), but few guidelines exist describing what surgeons should discuss. This study examines expert opinion regarding what constitutes informed consent.\nDesign. We conducted an anonymous, web-based, national survey of vascular surgeons. Associations between surgeon characteristics and opinions regarding informed consent were measured using bivariate statistics; multivariable logistic regression was performed to estimate effects adjusted for covariates. Setting. Academic and private practice surgeons were surveyed. Subjects. United States members of the International Society for Vascular Surgery membership. Main Outcome Measure. Surgeons' self-reported opinions regarding the content of informed consent for AAA repair.\nA total of 199 surgeons completed the survey (response rate 51%). More than 90% of respondents reported that it was essential to discuss mortality risk for both procedures. However, only 60% and 30% of respondents reported that it was essential to discuss the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, respectively. Opinions varied by procedure regarding the risks of impotence (32% vs 62%; EVAR vs open repair), reintervention (78% vs 17%), and rupture during long-term follow-up (57% vs 17%). Younger and private practice surgeons were more likely to discuss complications compared with older surgeons and those in academic practice. Surgeons who perform predominantly EVAR were more likely to quote higher mortality rates for open repair (odds ration [OR] = 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-6.4) and lower reintervention rates for EVAR (OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1-0.7) compared with other surgeons.\nThis is the first study of the practice of informed consent for AAA repair. The only risk that the vast majority of surgeons agreed should be included in informed consent for AAA repair was mortality. Significant variation exists regarding whether other complications should be discussed and what complication rates should be quoted. Surgeon characteristics may influence how risks are presented to patients. Further efforts are needed to develop guidelines to ensure consistent communication of appropriate risk during informed consent for AAA repair.",

    "abstract": "Randomized trials have shown that endovascular repair (EVAR) of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has a lower perioperative mortality than conventional open repair (OR). However, this initial survival advantage disappears after 1 year. To make EVAR cost-effective, patient selection should be improved. The Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS) estimates preoperative risk profiles that predict perioperative outcomes after OR. It was recently shown to predict perioperative and long-term mortality after EVAR as well. Here, we applied the GAS to patients from the Dutch Randomized Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (DREAM) trial and compared the applicability of the GAS between open repair and EVAR.\nA multicenter, randomized trial was conducted to compare OR with EVAR in 345 AAA patients. The GAS was calculated (age + [7 points for myocardial disease] + [10 points for cerebrovascular disease] + [14 points for renal disease]). Optimal cutoff values were determined, and test characteristics for 30-day and 2-year mortality were computed.\nThe mean GAS was 74.7 +/- 9.3 for OR patients and 75.9 +/- 9.7 for EVAR patients. Two EVAR patients and eight OR patients died < or =30 days postoperatively. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.79 for OR patients and 0.87 for EVAR patients. The optimal GAS cutoff value was 75.5 for OR and 86.5 for EVAR. By 2 years postoperatively, 18 patients had died in both the EVAR and the OR patient groups. The AUC was 0.74 for OR patients and 0.78 for EVAR patients. The optimal GAS cutoff value was 74.5 for OR and 77.5 for EVAR.\nThis is the first evaluation of the GAS in a randomized trial comparing AAA patients treated with OR and EVAR. The GAS can be used for prediction of 30-day and 2-year mortality in both OR and EVAR, but in patients that are suitable for both procedures, it is a better predictor for EVAR than for OR patients. In this study, the GAS was most valuable in identifying low-risk patients but not very useful for the identification of the small number of high-risk patients.",

We hypothesized that AGI occurs more often in patients with periprocedural nosocomial infections and less often after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nA retrospective cohort study was done of all patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (1987-2005) in Washington State by using the Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System (CHARS) data. Nosocomial infection was defined as one or more of pneumonia, urinary tract infections, blood stream septicemia, or surgical site infection at the index admission. Readmissions and reintervention for graft infections defined AGIs excluding the diagnostic code of renal failure or those who appeared to have dialysis grafts.\nBetween 1987 and 2005, 13,902 patients (mean age, 71.3 +/- 8.8 years; 90.8% men) underwent AAA repair (12,626 open, 1276 EVAR). The cumulative rate of AGIs in the cohort was 0.44%. The 2-year rate of AGI was 0.19% among open vs 0.16% in EVAR (P = .75) and 0.2% in both elective and nonelective patients. Open procedures had greater rates of perioperative pneumonia (11.1% vs 2.4%, P < .001), blood stream septicemia (1.6% vs 0.7%, P < .01), and surgical site infection (.5% vs 0%, P < .012) compared with EVAR. When individually analyzed, blood stream septicemia (.93% vs 18%, P = .014) and surgical site infection (1.61% vs 0.19%, P = .01) were significantly associated with AGIs. The median time to AGI was 3.0 years, and AGI presented sooner (< or =1.4 years) if nosocomial infection occurred at the index admission. This risk of developing AGI after open repair was highest in the first postoperative year (32% of all AGI occurred in year 1). In an adjusted model, blood stream septicemia was significantly associated with AGI (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-11.8)\nThe incidence of AGI was low, presented most commonly in the first postoperative year, and was similar among patients undergoing open AAA repair and EAVR. Patients with nosocomial infection had an earlier onset of AGI. The 2-year rate of AGI was significantly higher in patients who had blood stream septicemia and surgical site infection in the periprocedural hospitalization. These data may be helpful in directing surveillance programs for AIG.",

Logistic regression analysis showed that rupture (OR 6.03 [interval of confidence (IC) 95% 2.68-13.5] P = .0001), duration of operation (OR 5.73 [IC 95% 2.06-15.9] P = .001) and creatinin > 200 mol/l (OR 4.67 [IC 95% 1.39-15.7] P = .028) were independent factors of CI. The mortality due to colonic ischemia was not statistically different between open surgery 14/27 (52%) and EVAR 4/7 (57%).\nCI remains a serious complication following AAA repair. In the univariate analysis, EVAR was associated with a lower rate of colonic ischemia. However, the logistic regression analysis showed that only rupture, long duration of operation, and prior renal disease were independently associated with CI.

    "abstract": "This trial evaluated the safety and effectiveness of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with a contemporary endograft system compared with open surgical repair (open) of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms and large ulcers.\nForty-two international trial sites enrolled 230 subjects with descending thoracic aortic aneurysms or ulcers. The study compared 160 TEVAR subjects treated with the Zenith TX2 Endovascular Graft (William Cook Europe, ApS, Bjaeverskov, Denmark) with 70 open subjects. Subjects were evaluated preprocedure, predischarge, 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly through 5 years with medical examination, laboratory testing, chest radiographs, and computed tomography scans. Mortality rates, prespecified severe morbidity composite index, major morbidity, clinical utility, aneurysm rupture, and secondary interventions were compared. The TEVAR subjects were evaluated by a core laboratory for device performance, including change in aneurysm size, endoleak, migration, and device integrity.\nThe 30-day survival rate was noninferior (P < .01) for the TEVAR group compared with the open group (98.1% vs 94.3%). The severe morbidity composite index was lower for TEVAR (0.2 +/- 0.7 vs 0.7 +/- 1.2; P < .01). Cumulative major morbidity scores were significantly lower at 30 days for the TEVAR group compared with the open group (1.3 +/- 3.0 vs 2.9 +/- 3.6, P < .01). The TEVAR patients had fewer cardiovascular, pulmonary, and vascular adverse events, although neurologic events were not significantly different. Clinical utility for the TEVAR patients was superior to that of the open patients. No ruptures or conversions occurred in the first year. Reintervention rates were similar in both groups. At 12 months, aneurysm growth was identified in 7.1% (8/112), endoleak in 3.9% (4/103), migration (>10 mm) in 2.8% (3/107), and other device issues were rare. None of the patients with migration experienced endoleak, aneurysm growth, or required a secondary intervention.\nThoracic endovascular aortic repair with the TX2 is a safer and effective alternative to open surgical repair for the treatment of anatomically suitable descending thoracic aortic aneurysms and ulcers at 1 year of follow-up. Device performance issues are infrequent, but careful planning and regular follow-up with imaging remain a necessity.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy is beneficial in severe (>70%) symptomatic carotid stenosis. The risk of stroke in moderate carotid stenosis (50%-69%) is modest, and so the role of carotid endarterectomy in this group is unclear. Intraplaque hemorrhage is associated with advanced atherosclerosis and can be detected in the carotid arteries by magnetic resonance imaging. This study evaluates whether magnetic resonance imaging detected intraplaque hemorrhage (MR IPH) can identify patients with symptomatic mild to moderate carotid stenosis who are at higher risk of ipsilateral transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke.\nProspective longitudinal cohort study of symptomatic patients with mild to moderate (30%-69%) carotid stenosis followed up for 2 years after imaging for IPH using magnetic resonance imaging.\nSixty four participants were followed up for a median of 28 months (interquartile range 26-30) after MRI of the carotid arteries. Thirty-nine (61%) ipsilateral arteries showed intraplaque hemorrhage. During follow-up, five ipsilateral strokes and a total of 14 ipsilateral ischemic events were observed. Thirteen of these ischemic events, of which five were strokes, occurred in those with ipsilateral carotid intraplaque hemorrhage (hazard ratio = 9.8, 95% confidence interval 1.3-75.1, P = .03).\nMR IPH is a good predictor of ipsilateral stroke and TIA in patients with symptomatic mild to moderate (30%-69%) carotid stenosis. This technique could help in the selection of patients for carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "Cold-induced injury to various cell types has been shown to be mediated predominantly by chelatable iron. For endothelial cells, this type of injury has so far only been shown in cultured cells. Hypothesizing that this iron-dependent cold-induced injury might also occur in the endothelium of intact vessels, we here set out to optimize the hypothermic storage of blood vessels.\nSegments of porcine aorta were stored for 2 to 21 days in histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution or in modified solutions with or without the iron chelators deferoxamine or LK 614 at 4 degrees C. Parts of the segments were assayed immediately after cold storage, the other parts after subsequent rewarming. The percentage of dead (propidium iodide-positive) endothelial cells was assessed by \"intravital\" fluorescence microscopy, mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed by laser scanning microscopy after staining with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) and thrombocyte adhesion was studied using 5-(and -6)-carboxy SNARF-1-stained thrombocytes.\nThe endothelium of porcine aortic segments sustained moderate injury during the cold incubation itself, but major injury during rewarming. The addition of the iron chelator deferoxamine (1 mmol/L) significantly inhibited cold-induced endothelial cell injury irrespective of the solution used for cold storage (eg, 14 days of cold storage + 3 hours rewarming: HTK 66 +/- 7%, HTK + 1 mmol/L deferoxamine 40 +/- 10% propidium iodide-positive endothelial cells). An amino acid (glycine, alanine, aspartate)-containing base solution with N-acetylhistidine as buffer was optimized. The optimized base solution with pH 7.0 and potassium and chloride as main ions yielded a further decrease of endothelial cell injury. Combination of deferoxamine (in lower concentration, ie, 0.1 mmol/L) with the new, more membrane-permeable iron chelator LK 614 (20 mumol/L) further improved preservation so that even after 3 weeks of cold storage plus 3 hours rewarming only 10 +/- 1% of endothelial cells were propidium iodide positive. In this optimized solution, both endothelial cell survival and mitochondrial membrane potential were significantly better preserved than in the clinically used solutions HTK, University of Wisconsin (UW) and Perfadex, or in physiological saline. Thrombocyte adhesion was also significantly reduced after cold storage in the optimized solution compared with HTK solution.\nCold-induced injury to the endothelium of porcine aortic segments is, as the injury to cultured endothelial cells, mediated by chelatable iron. Thus, iron chelators, but also optimized base solutions, are options to improve the storage of vascular endothelium. The optimized solution should now be tested in in vivo animal experiments.",

    "abstract": "While medical high risk (MHR) has been proposed as an indication for carotid artery stenting (CAS), the impact of MHR on long-term survival and stroke after CAS has not been described.\nA retrospective chart review of CAS procedures at our institution was performed. One hundred seventy-nine consecutive patients who underwent 196 CAS procedures were classified by MHR status based on cardiac, pulmonary, and renal criteria routinely used in high-risk clinical trials. Survival and stroke rates were compared after 90 CAS procedures in MHR patients vs 106 CAS procedures in normal risk patients. Survival results were also compared with 365 contemporaneous carotid endarterectomy (CEA) procedures in 346 patients.\nThe mean age of CAS patients was 72 years, with 87% having a smoking history, 85% hypertension, 38% diabetes, 39% symptomatic, and 74% documented coronary artery disease. Mean follow-up was 23 months. Recurrent stenosis after CEA comprised 21% of all CAS procedures. During the 30-day post-procedure period, there were five minor strokes, one major stroke, and one death, for a combined stroke/death rate of 3.6%. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated mortality of 5% at 1 year and 21% at 3 years for the entire cohort. Cox regression analysis found that MHR designation was not associated with increased mortality or an increase in a composite end point of death or stroke. MHR patients had mortality of 4% at 1 year and 22% at 3 years. Normal risk patients had mortality of 6% at 1 year and 20% at 3 years. Preoperative age over 80 years old, low density lipoprotein (LDL) > or =160 mg/dL, and serum creatinine > or =1.5 mg/dL conferred statistically significant risk for death (Hazard ratios: 2.9, 4.3, and 2.4, respectively). As a point of comparison, a contemporaneous group of CEA patients were analyzed similarly. After adjusting for age over 80 years old and serum creatinine > or =1.5 mg/dL, there was no survival difference between MHR patients undergoing CAS or CEA.\nThe presence of MHR did not impact long-term survival or stroke rate after CAS, and overall survival of MHR patients in our series was comparable with risk-adjusted controls undergoing CEA. These results suggest the need for more refined predictors of medical risk to optimally guide patients in selecting carotid revascularization strategies.",

MHR patients had mortality of 4% at 1 year and 22% at 3 years. Normal risk patients had mortality of 6% at 1 year and 20% at 3 years. Preoperative age over 80 years old, low density lipoprotein (LDL) > or =160 mg/dL, and serum creatinine > or =1.5 mg/dL conferred statistically significant risk for death (Hazard ratios: 2.9, 4.3, and 2.4, respectively). As a point of comparison, a contemporaneous group of CEA patients were analyzed similarly. After adjusting for age over 80 years old and serum creatinine > or =1.5 mg/dL, there was no survival difference between MHR patients undergoing CAS or CEA.",

    "abstract": "The 2006 update of the DOQI guidelines has stated that in patients with end-stage renal disease, autogenous radial-cephalic, or brachial-cephalic fistulas are the preferred access modalities, followed by transposed brachial-basilic (TBB) fistulas and prosthetic arteriovenous (AV) grafts. AV grafts are in general least preferred; however, there is very limited data comparing directly the last two modalities. The aim of the present study is to compare outcomes of the TBB fistula and the Vectra Vascular Access Graft.\nSeventy-six patients had a prosthetic brachial-axillary Vectra graft placed, while in 41 patients brachial-basilic upper arm transposition was performed. Graft surveillance to detect a failing/failed access was followed by endovascular treatment, rheolytic thrombectomy (AngioJet, Possis Medical), and/or angioplasty +/- stenting of the responsible anatomical lesion(s).\nUse of Vectra grafts and TBB fistulas started after a median (interquartile range) of 14 (7-30) and 70 (52-102) days, respectively (P < .001), as early as the operative day in some patients with grafts. Postoperative complications were more frequent in TBB fistulas and late complications (mainly access thrombosis) in Vectra grafts. Total number of thrombectomy sessions performed for graft or fistula occlusion was 45 and 7, respectively (P = .032); total number of isolated angioplasty sessions, performed for failing graft or fistula was 31 and 45, respectively (P = .004). Although primary patency of the two access modalities was equivalent, primary assisted patency was significantly reduced in Vectra grafts (70% at 12 months and 58% at 18 months), compared with TBB fistulas (82% at 12 months and 78% at 18 months, P = .033); however, as a result of endovascular intervention, secondary patency rates at 12 months (87% vs 88%) and 18 months (87% vs 83%) were equivalent (P = .91). Presence of arterial anastomosis stenosis treated with angioplasty at any stage had a significant negative predictive value on secondary patency rates at 12 and 18 months which were 61%, compared with 96% for Vectra grafts that had any intra-graft, venous outflow, draining or central vein stenosis treated with angioplasty at any stage (P = .010).\nAggressive graft surveillance and endovascular treatment methods can yield equivalent long-term secondary patency rates between Vectra graft and TBB fistulas. The advantage of earlier use of Vectra graft must be balanced against the need for more frequent secondary interventions and the risk of graft infection.",

    "abstract": "The role of carotid surgery for the management of restenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is challenged by carotid artery stenting (CAS). We reviewed redo CEA in a consecutive series of patients to determine the safety, durability, and long-term benefit associated with repeat surgical treatment for restenosis.\nA consecutive series of 73 redo procedures in 72 patients (57% men) with a mean age 66 years (range, 49-81 years) was analyzed. The mean interval between prior CEA and redo CEA was 53 months (range, 8-192 months). Operative indications included symptomatic restenosis in 28 patients (38%). A patch angioplasty was performed in 62 patients (85%). The main outcome measures included perioperative and late stroke and death, and the development of secondary restenosis.\nThere were no perioperative deaths or strokes. During a mean follow-up of 52 months (range, 12-144 months), the Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival was 85% at 5 years. At 5 years, the cumulative rate of freedom from all strokes was 98%, and the freedom from ipsilateral stroke was 100%. After secondary procedures, re-recurrent stenosis > or =50% occurred in 10 patients (13.7%). The cumulative freedom from re-restenosis (> or =50%) was 85% at 5 years. Five patients (7%) received tertiary carotid reconstructions.\nRepeat CEA for recurrent stenosis can be performed safely with excellent long-term protection from stroke.

    "abstract": "Vascular access is a necessity for patients with end-stage renal disease who need chronic intermittent hemodialysis. According to Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, radial-cephalic (RC) and brachial-cephalic (BC) arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) are the first and second choice for vascular access, respectively. If these options are not possible, an autogenous brachial-basilic fistula in the upper arm (BBAVF) or a prosthetic brachial-antecubital forearm loop (PTFE loop) may be considered. Until now, it was not clear which access type was preferable. We have performed a randomized study comparing BBAVF and prosthetic implantation in patients without the possibility for RCAVF or BCAVF.\nPatients with failed primary/secondary access or inadequate arterial and/or venous vessels were randomized for either BBAVF or PTFE loop creation. The numbers of complications and interventions were recorded. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate primary, assisted-primary and secondary patency rates. The patency rates were compared with the log-rank test. Complication and intervention rates were compared with the Mann-Whitney test.\nA total of 105 patients were randomized for a BBAVF or PTFE loop (52 vs 53, respectively). Primary and assisted-primary 1-year patency rates were significantly higher in the BBAVF group: 46% +/- 7.4% vs 22% +/- 6.1% (P = .005) and 87% +/- 5.0% vs 71% +/- 6.7% (P = .045) for the BBAVF and PTFE group, respectively. Secondary patencies were comparable for both groups; 89% +/- 4.6% vs 85% +/- 5.2% for the BBAVF and PTFE group, respectively. The incidence rate of complications was 1.6 per patient-year in the BBAVF group vs 2.7 per patient-year in the PTFE group. Patients in the BBAVF group needed a total of 1.7 interventions per patient-year vs 2.7 per patient-year for the PTFE group.\nThese data show a significantly better primary and assisted-primary patency in the BBAVF group compared with the PTFE group. Furthermore, in the BBAVF group, fewer interventions were needed. Therefore, we conclude that BBAVF is the preferred choice for vascular access if RCAVF or BCAVF creation is impossible, or when these types of access have already failed.",

At the time of approval, the United States Food and Drug Administration required an additional long-term safety study to evaluate the effect cilostazol on mortality.\nA total of 1899 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of PAD and symptoms of claudication were screened for participation in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled safety study of cilostazol. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which was the primary analysis (n = 1435), was defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication and included patients who were followed up >30 days after discontinuation of study drug. A total of 717 patients received cilostazol and 718 received placebo. Cilostazol was administered at a primary dose of 100 mg twice daily. The dose could be reduced to 50 mg twice daily if patients experienced an adverse event that might have been drug related.\nLong-term adherence to study medication was poor, with >60% of participants discontinuing therapy by 36 months. The mortality analysis therefore focused on deaths during the period on-treatment, defined as the period during which the study drug was taken plus a 30-day follow-up period after dosing. Total patient-years of exposure were 1046 on-treatment for cilostazol and 1090 for placebo. On-treatment, there were 18 deaths on cilostazol and 19 deaths on placebo for a hazard ratio of 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-1.88).

In the full ITT population at 36 months, there were 101 deaths, 49 on cilostazol and 52 on placebo, with hazard ratio of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.64-1.39).

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to review the currently available literature and to compare the short and long-term results of primary stenting and angioplasty of femoropopliteal occlusive disease by performing a meta-analysis review.\nA systematic review of the literature that was published between September 2000 and January 2007 was performed. All studies that reported data on the long-term results after balloon dilatation or stent implantation were included if at least one-year primary patency or restenosis rate was presented; the study follow-up was at least 1 year and the number of subjects at the start of study was at least 20 patients. Three investigators independently extracted the data. The Pooled survival curves were then constructed for graft patency according to a random-effects protocol for meta-analysis.\nTwenty-four articles were initially identified but only seven were selected and included in this meta-analysis: seven were RCTs publications and one was a retrospective study comparing the outcome of angioplasty and stenting of the femoropopliteal segment. In our meta-analysis, there were a total of 934 patients with 452 patients who underwent balloon angioplasty (273 patients were male) and 482 patients who underwent stenting (297 patients were male). Primary patency at 1-year and postoperative ABI post intervention was used to evaluate the pooled odds ratio (OR) of all studies. The pooled OR of all studies estimate for the 12-month patency rates was 0.989 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.623 to 1.570, P = .962) showing no difference in outcome between the two groups (SE 0.269% to 1.025%). The pooled OR estimate for the postoperative ABI was 0.869 (95% CI, 0.557 to 1.357, P = .561) showing a slight advantage in favor of the angioplasty group but the P value was not statistically significant (SE 0.282% to 1.326%). The 1-year primary patency rates following balloon angioplasty ranged from 45% to 84.2% and at 2 years it varied from 25% to 77.2%. In the stent implantation group, the 1-year primary patency rates varied from 63% to 90%, and 2-year primary patency ranged from 46% to 87%. Heterogeneity was seen among studies, and publication bias could not be excluded.\nThe results of our meta-analysis suggest that stent placement in the femoropopliteal occlusive disease does not increase the patency rate when compared with angioplasty alone at 1 year. This conclusion should be viewed in the light of study-design considerations and all limitations in this meta-analysis that may have an impact of the outcome of stenting and angioplasty after a 1-year follow-up.",

In our meta-analysis, there were a total of 934 patients with 452 patients who underwent balloon angioplasty (273 patients were male) and 482 patients who underwent stenting (297 patients were male). Primary patency at 1-year and postoperative ABI post intervention was used to evaluate the pooled odds ratio (OR) of all studies. The pooled OR of all studies estimate for the 12-month patency rates was 0.989 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.623 to 1.570, P = .962) showing no difference in outcome between the two groups (SE 0.269% to 1.025%). The pooled OR estimate for the postoperative ABI was 0.869 (95% CI, 0.557 to 1.357, P = .561) showing a slight advantage in favor of the angioplasty group but the P value was not statistically significant (SE 0.282% to 1.326%). The 1-year primary patency rates following balloon angioplasty ranged from 45% to 84.2% and at 2 years it varied from 25% to 77.2%. In the stent implantation group, the 1-year primary patency rates varied from 63% to 90%, and 2-year primary patency ranged from 46% to 87%. Heterogeneity was seen among studies, and publication bias could not be excluded.",

Although distal revascularization with interval ligation appears to offer the greatest likelihood of symptom relief and vascular access salvage, not all fistulas are amenable to this procedure, particularly distal radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas. In this report, we describe the treatment of steal syndrome in a patient with a distal radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula using a percutaneous approach and endovascular coils. After coil embolization of the distal radial artery and multiple collateral vessels, steal was no longer visualized using angiography, and the patient's symptoms resolved.",

    "abstract": "Albeit uncommon, delayed renal dysfunction after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) can be attributed to proximal stent graft migration or unrecognized partial renal artery coverage. We report two patients who were found to have renal artery occlusion 1 week after EVAR with Zenith (Cook, Bloomington, Ind) infrarenal devices despite patent bilateral renal arteries shown on completion angiograms. Both patients presented with prolonged symptoms of acute renal failure, and uremic encephalopathy developed in one. Both patients were successfully treated with renal artery stenting, which led to symptom resolution and recovery of renal function. Our cases highlight that although postoperative renal occlusion after EVAR is rare, a high index of suspicion and urgent intervention are warranted because renal salvage can be achieved after prolonged ischemic insult.",

    "abstract": "Thrombosis in unusual locations in the lower extremity veins has not been assessed. These veins are not imaged routinely and therefore information about them is lacking.\nThis study was designed to evaluate the natural history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in unusual sites. Patients with DVT in all thigh veins but the femoral vein were included. Patients with thrombi in any other vein in the first examination and those with history of DVT were excluded. Duplex ultrasound (DU) examination was performed to exclude thrombosis in the lower extremity in patients with signs and symptoms of venous thromboembolism and also in high-risk, asymptomatic patients. All veins from the distal external iliac vein to the lower calf were imaged. The deep femoral, femoropopliteal, lateral thigh, sciatic, and muscular thigh veins were examined. These patients were followed at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and yearly thereafter, for thrombus propagation, resolution, and reflux.\nAmong the 15,850 DU performed in the vascular laboratory at Loyola University Medical Center, in a 10-year period to rule out DVT, 2568 (16.2%) were positive and 14 cases (7 males, 0.54% among the patients with DVT and 0.088% among the entire population) involved thromboses in unusual locations. Ten cases involved the left lower extremity and four the right. The unusual DVT cases were associated with medical and surgical conditions or were idiopathic in 11 patients, whereas three had Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS). The veins involved in the first group of patients were the deep femoral (8), the femoropopliteal (2), and the deep external pudendal (1). The patients with KTS had involvement of muscular thigh veins (1), and the lateral thigh vein and the sciatic vein (2). Thrombi propagation with extension to the common femoral vein was seen in four of the 14 patients: two from the deep femoral vein, one from the femoropopliteal vein, and one from the deep external pudendal vein. There were two incidences of pulmonary embolism (PE) one of which was fatal. At final follow-up, two patients developed recurrent DVT and nine had signs and symptoms of chronic venous disease.\nThe involvement of the studied veins in DVT is extremely rare. Thrombosis in these veins can follow the natural course of thrombosis in the more usual locations and is associated with lethal incidences of PE. Therefore, the association of these veins with all the grave sequelae of thromboembolic disease suggests that inclusion of these veins in routine lower extremity duplex scans would be beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Bone marrow-derived cells are recruited into the thrombus during resolution. This study explored whether mobilization of bone marrow cells with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) could enhance the resolution of venous thrombi and the accumulation of macrophages in thrombi and explored the effect of rhG-CSF on cysteine-cysteine chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) expression.\nThe Sprague-Dawley adult rats were randomly divided into four groups: control, sham-operated, thrombus, and treatment groups. Thrombi were induced in the thrombus and treatment group, which received a subcutaneous injection of rhG-CSF once daily for 6 days postoperatively. The thrombus, sham-operated, and control groups received equal volumes of 0.9% saline. The mononuclear cells in peripheral blood were analyzed by an automated hematology analyzer and counted under microscope. The cell marker CD68 was used to determine the number of macrophages in thrombi tissue sections. Levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP1alpha) in the peripheral blood were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to analyze, respectively, the expression of CCR2 messenger RNA in the peripheral blood and CCR2 protein of THP-1 monocyte.\nAt postoperative days 3 (P < .05) and 7 (P < .01), mononuclear cells significantly increased in treatment group (2.1 +/- 0.3, 4.4 +/- 0.3 x 10(6)/L) vs the thrombus group (1.7 +/- 0.2, 1.3 +/- 0.4 x 10(6)/L). The organization and recanalization of thrombi in treatment group progressed more quickly compared with the thrombus group (P < .01). The macrophage number of the thrombus in the treatment group (338 +/- 26 cells/15 high-power fields) increased significantly vs the thrombus group (125 +/- 11 cells/15 high-power fields, P < .01). No statistical difference was observed between the thrombus and treatment group in the MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha level in peripheral blood. Expressions of the CCR2 gene in the peripheral blood of the treatment group significantly increased compared with the thrombus group (P < .05). Recombinant human G-CSF induced higher expression of CCR2 protein of human monocytic cell line THP-1.\nBone marrow mobilization enhanced the resolution and recanalization of venous thrombi. This process was associated with increased macrophage accumulation in thrombi, which might be the result of higher CCR2 expression of monocytes.\nThe classic treatment of venous thrombi is anticoagulation. Anticoagulant therapy and thrombolysis both have limited effects on existing thrombi and have a small but significant risk of severe hemorrhage. In clinical practice, we lack specific treatment for patients with venous thrombosis combined with brain hemorrhage or a gastrointestinal activated ulcer, which are contraindicated for anticoagulation and thrombolytic therapy. Enhancing the resolution of venous thrombi would contribute to its therapy. Bone marrow-derived cells are recruited into the thrombus during resolution. Many of these cells express a macrophage phenotype and may represent a population of plastic stem cells that orchestrate thrombus recanalization. Recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) can mobilize monocytic lineage cells into peripheral blood and may contribute to this cell in the thrombi. If rhG-CSF enhances the resolution of venous thrombi and recanalization, it might be used to treat patients with venous thrombi, especially those who have contraindication for anticoagulation and thrombolytic therapy.",

    "abstract": "Neovascularization at the saphenofemoral junction is one of the principal causes of recurrent varicose veins after great saphenous vein surgery. Because angiogenic stimulation from the exposed endothelium of the great saphenous vein stump is considered an important trigger for this process, we hypothesized that complete resection of the stump with endothelial inversion might lessen grade 2 groin neovascularization and thereby decrease recurrence of thigh varicosities.\nTwo groups of consecutive patients with primary varicose veins of the great saphenous vein were studied. Group A was a historical control group of 70 limbs (48 patients) in which conventional flush ligation was performed at the level of the saphenofemoral junction. Group B was a prospectively studied clinical trial cohort of 65 limbs (45 patients), wherein the great saphenous vein stump was completely resected using a side-biting clamp to isolate the saphenofemoral junction, and the resulting common femoral vein venotomy was closed with a running inverting suture. Early postoperative follow-up was performed at 6 weeks. Clinical examinations and duplex ultrasound scans were performed after 2 years of follow-up. Grade 2 groin neovascularization was defined by the presence of >3 mm tortuous new refluxing veins, typically communicating with recurrent varicosities in the thigh.\nAfter 2 years, recurrent varicose veins were present in the thighs of 13 of 65 limbs (20%) in group A and in 22 of 61 limbs (36%) of group B (P = .049). Grade 2 neovascularization was present at the saphenofemoral junction in six of 65 limbs (9%) of group A and in 12 of 61 limbs (20%) of group B (P = .127).\nComplete resection of the great saphenous vein stump and inversion suturing of the common femoral vein venotomy, instead of simple flush ligation at the level of the saphenofemoral junction, do not appear to decrease grade 2 neovascularization and related thigh varicosity recurrence after great saphenous vein stripping for primary varicose veins.",

    "abstract": "Given improvements in care for peripheral vascular disease and diabetes over the last two decades, it was of interest whether racial disparities in lower extremity amputation rates had changed.\nHospital data for 18 years (1987-2004) were used to compute above, below, and through foot amputation rates for over eight million people living in the Chicago metropolitan area. Three areas were created from zip code level census data. Differences in amputation rates were compared between residents of zip code areas that were >50% African American, 10% to 50% African American, or <10% African American.\nThe largely African American area of the South and West sides of Chicago, with less than 15% of the area population, accounted for 27% of all amputation discharges (n = 33,775) over the 18 years. For all residents of northern Illinois, major (above and below knee) amputation rates declined to 17 per 100,000 residents over the last decade, and both inpatient mortality and length of stay fell throughout the period. However, residents of largely African American zip codes had over five times higher per capita amputation rates than residents of primarily white zip codes.\nRacial disparities have remained remarkably constant, despite progress in reducing the overall major amputation rate in northern Illinois. Addressing these disparities will require that low income, medically complex patients at risk of limb loss receive timelier, high performance care, combined with community-based public health and preventive medicine interventions that address the social determinants of health.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is an increasingly popular treatment option for patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), although open repair is considered the standard by virtue of its durability. Octogenarians, as a subgroup, may stand to benefit the most by EVAR. The purpose of this study is to review operative results and durability of open AAA repair and EVAR in octogenarians.\nFrom May 1996 to August 2006, 150 patients aged >or=80 years underwent elective repair of their infrarenal AAA. Eighty-one underwent EVAR and 69 had open repair. Demographic data, aneurysm specifics, comorbidities, operative morbidity and mortality, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, and late outcomes were analyzed.\nIn the EVAR group, 27 of 81 (33%) patients died during a mean follow-up of 25 months. In the open repair group, 34 of 69 (49%) patients died during a mean follow-up of 43 months. The median survival time for EVAR was 350 weeks (range, 145-404 weeks) compared with 317 weeks (range, 233-342 weeks) for the open repair group. A Kaplan-Meier log-rank analysis showed no difference in early or long-term survival between EVAR and open repair (P = .13). EVAR was associated with decreased blood loss, decreased length of intensive care unit and hospital stays, and a greater number of patients discharged to home.\nEVAR and open repair are comparable in safety and efficacy in octogenarians. Operative repair outcomes remain acceptable. Mid- and long-term survival are similar, indicating no survival advantage of one procedure compared with the other.",

    "abstract": "Increased blood flow causes neointimal atrophy, whereas relief of wall tension with an external wrap causes arterial medial atrophy. To study the effects of blood flow and wall tension separately and together, we applied tight or loose wraps on high-flow or normal-flow iliac arteries in baboons.\nBaboon external iliac arteries were wrapped with loose-fitting and tight-fitting expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), leaving part unwrapped. A downstream arteriovenous fistula was constructed on one side to increase blood flow approximately twofold. The arteries were perfusion-fixed with 10% formalin after 4 (n = 5) and 28 days (n = 5).\nAt 4 days, compared with the unwrapped artery, the loosely and tightly wrapped normal-flow artery showed significant medial atrophy (23% and 30%, respectively; P < .05). The tightly wrapped artery showed a loss of cells (27%; P = .02) but no change in cell density. At 28 days, the medial cross-sectional area was decreased by the tight wrap and loose wrap under normal (45% and 28%, respectively; P < .05) and high (43% and 29%, respectively; P < .05) flow. High flow did not alter the effect of wrapping nor did it affect the unwrapped medial area. At 28 days, the normal and high flow tightly wrapped media showed an insignificant loss of cells but had increased cell density (47% and 30%, respectively; P < .05), suggesting preferential loss of extracellular matrix. Decorin was expressed at the late time only in the tightly wrapped normal and high-flow media and was associated with tight packing of the collagen, as detected by picrosirius red staining.\nLoose-fitting and tight-fitting ePTFE wraps induced an inflammatory foreign body response that caused medial atrophy with loss of cells and extracellular matrix; the tight wrap was more effective. High blood flow did not prevent or augment medial atrophy.\nResearch in arterial restenosis has focused on the biologic mechanisms and pharmacologic approaches to the prevention of intimal hyperplasia. An alternative therapeutic approach might be to induce atrophy of established intimal hyperplasia. We have previously reported that high blood flow induces neointimal regression in expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in baboons. Here we provide another model of vascular atrophy induced by external wrapping. The similarity between baboons and humans in their vascular systems and individual genetic heterogeneity makes these experiments of great relevance. Up- or down-regulated genes common to both models might be key regulators of vascular atrophy and therefore suitable therapeutic targets for pharmacologic treatment of established lesions.",

    "abstract": "Report the results of a phase II multicenter, prospective trial comparing endovascular treatment of descending thoracic aneurysm (TEVAR) with the TAG device to surgical controls after 5 years of follow-up.\nThe Gore TAG trial compared the TAG endograft patients (n = 140) with standard open surgical controls (n = 94) with enrollment from September of 1999 to May of 2001. An additional 51 patients were enrolled in 2003 after revision of the endograft. Follow-up consisted of patient visits, computed tomography (CT) scans and x-rays at 1, 6, and 12 months and yearly. Significant sac size change was defined as >or=5 mm increase or decrease from the 1 month baseline measurement. Migration was defined as >or=10 mm cranial or caudal movement of the device inside the aorta. Significance was determined as P <or= .05.\nAt 5 years, aneurysm-related mortality was lower for TAG patients at 2.8% compared with open controls at 11.7% (P = .008). No differences in all-cause mortality were noted, with 68% of TAG patients and 67% of open controls surviving to 5 years (P = .43). Major adverse events at 5 years were significantly reduced in the TAG group; 57.9% vs 78.7% (P = .001). Endoleaks in the TAG group decreased from 8.1% at 1 month to 4.3% at 5 years. Five TAG patients have undergone major aneurysm-related re-interventions at 5 years (3.6%), including one arch aneurysm repair for type 1 endoleak and migration, one open conversion and five endovascular procedures for endoleaks in three patients. There were fewer secondary procedures not directly related to aneurysm repair in the TAG vs the open repair group at 5 years, 15.0% vs 31.9%, (P = .01). For TAG patients, sac size at 60 months decreased in 50% and increased in 19% compared with the 1-month baseline. Comparison with the modified low-porosity device at 24 months showed sac increase in 12.9% of original vs 2.9% in modified grafts (P = .11). At 5 years, there have been no ruptures, one migration, no collapse, and 20 instances of fracture in 19 patients, all before the revision of the TAG graft.\nIn anatomically suitable patients, TAG treatment of thoracic aneurysms is superior to surgical repair at 5 years. Although sac enlargement is concerning, early modified device results indicate this issue may be resolved.",

    "abstract": "Neointimal hyperplasia is strikingly suppressed in an endothelium injury model in mice deficient in the growth factor midkine. Knockdown of midkine expression by means of antisense oligonucleotide or small interfering RNA has been shown to lead to suppression of neointimal hyperplasia in a balloon injury model and a rabbit vein graft model; therefore, midkine is an essential factor for neointimal hyperplasia. These findings, however, do not necessarily apply to the function of midkine in vascular stenoses such as in-stent restenosis, because human vascular stenosis is often accompanied by atherosclerosis.\nWe investigated midkine expression in the neointima induced by implantation of a bare metal stent in the atheromatous lesions of hypercholesterolemic rabbits. We analyzed midkine expression during a THP-1 cell differentiation and in peritoneal macrophages exposed to low-density lipoprotein or oxidized low-density lipoprotein.\nMidkine expression reached the maximum level within 7 days after stenting and was detected in infiltrating macrophages. Differentiation of THP-1 cells to macrophage-like cells did not trigger midkine expression. Neither low-density lipoprotein nor oxidized low-density lipoprotein enhanced midkine expression in peritoneal macrophages that had been activated by thioglycollate, although these cells expressed a significant amount of midkine.\nThe results indicate that macrophages are the major source of midkine in the atherosclerotic neointima. The amount of midkine expressed in macrophages may be sufficient (ie, further enhancement of the expression is not necessary) for the pathogenesis, because oxidized low-density lipoprotein stimulation did not induce the midkine expression.\nThe growth factor midkine is induced during vascular stenosis in mouse and rat models with normal diet. Knockdown of midkine expression suppresses neointimal hyperplasia. The vascular response after stenting differs from that after balloon injury in that the inflammation is more prolonged and the accumulation of macrophages is more abundant in stent-injured vessel. We found here that macrophages are the major source of midkine in the atherosclerotic neointima of in-stent restenosis in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. Our data suggest that midkine has an important role in in-stent restenosis of atherosclerotic vessels and is a candidate molecular target to prevent in-stent restenosis.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the possibility of restoring a physiologic vascular wall using undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) seeded on a polyurethane vascular prosthesis.\nUndifferentiated MSCs were seeded on a vascular prosthesis and implanted into Wistar male rats (weight, 350 g) to investigate differentiation into smooth muscle cells and to determine graft endothelialization in vivo.\nSeeded or nonseeded grafts were surgically implanted. Undifferentiated MSCs were first labelled for green fluorescent protein. After 2 weeks in vivo, MSC that were initially self-expanded on the graft in a monolayer were organized in a multicellular layer mimicking media of aortic adjacent wall. They coexpressed green fluorescent protein and smooth muscle proteins that were not present before the in vivo engraftment, indicating that in vivo conditions induced smooth muscle protein maturation. Undifferentiated MSC showed an electrophysiologic profile quite different than mature smooth muscle cells. In both in vitro- and in vivo-differentiated MSCs, adenosine triphosphate, an IP(3)-dependent agonist, induced an increase in calcium similar to that which occurred in mature smooth muscle cells. However, MSCs failed to respond to caffeine, a ryanodine receptor activator, indicating the absence of mature calcium signaling, and finally, contraction was absent. Endothelialization attested by immunohistology and scanning electron microscopy was greater in MSC-seeded grafts that prevent thrombosis.\nOnly partial smooth muscle cell differentiation of MSCs resulted when seeded on vascular grafts, but MSCs spontaneously restore a media-like thick wall.

In part 2, heparin equivalent to that in normal plasma was added to blood samples from 15 patients with short-distance claudication (n = 4) or rest pain (n = 11), and baseline (without heparinase) thromboelastography was performed to exclude lack of antithrombin as a cause of diminished heparin-like activity.\nIn part 1, all patients with PAOD had a significant increase in coagulability compared with controls. Heparinase-modified thromboelastography in controls showed a significant decrease in the latent period between placing the sample in the analyser, where it is recalcified, to the initial fibrin formation (DeltaR time; P = .002) compared with native TEG, confirming endogenous heparin-like activity. Using DeltaR time as a measure of heparin-like activity, a significant reduction was found in patients with claudication (0.33 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.004-0.65; P = .02) and in those with rest pain (0.25 minutes; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.52; P = .02) compared with that in controls (0.78 minutes; 95% CI, 0.39-1.16). The DeltaR time also correlated with the ABPI (r = 0.35, P = .02), suggesting declining heparin-like activity with increasing ischemia. In part 2, exogenous heparin restored the thromboelastography in PAOD patients to normal, suggesting that lack of endogenous heparin-like compounds rather than reduced antithrombin levels was responsible for changes in coagulation.\nPatients with PAOD have reduced endogenous heparin-like activity that correlates with disease severity.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous access during endovascular aortic repair has been shown to be feasible and safe using a suture-mediated closure device (\"Preclose\" technique) for closure of up to 24F introducer sheaths. The purpose of this study is to examine the late outcomes of those femoral arteries repaired in this manner.\nThe Preclose technique has been previously described. Briefly, the technique involves two Perclose Proglide devices deployed in the femoral artery prior to insertion of the large diameter introducer sheath and then closure of the arteriotomy by tying down knots of the Proglide following removal of the sheath. The medical records of all patients who underwent endovascular aortic repairs using the Preclose technique between December 2004 and August 2007 were reviewed. Follow-up protocol consisted of computed tomography (CT) angiograms performed at 1, 6, and 12 months, and annually thereafter. All Preclose patients who had at least a 6-month postoperative scan were included in the study. For each patient, the most recent postoperative scan was compared with the preoperative scan for evidence of any new anatomic abnormalities of the femoral artery such as dissection, stenosis, or pseudoaneurysm. Three-dimensional post processing with multiplanar reconstructions was also performed as necessary to confirm axial scan findings.\nA total of 292 patients underwent percutaneous endovascular aortic repairs (TEVAR-125, EVAR-167). Four hundred thirty-two femoral arteries were closed with 870 devices. Four hundred eighteen vessels were approximated with two devices, while 30 arteries required three devices for hemostasis and an additional four vessels only required a single device. Two hundred seventy-eight (64.3%) vessels were accessed with sheaths 18 to 24F. Four hundred eight femoral arteries (94.4%) were closed successfully with the Preclose technique. There were 100 patients (TEVAR-35, EVAR-65) who had adequate postoperative CT scan at 6-months or later. The mean follow up was 11.6 +/- 5.0 months. Of the 156 femoral arteries in these 100 patients repaired using the Preclose technique, there were 3 late complications in 3 patients, 1 asymptomatic femoral artery dissection, and 2 femoral artery pseudoaneurysms requiring surgical repair, resulting in a late complication rate of 1.92% (3/156).\nPercutaneous closure of femoral arteries after large diameter introducer sheaths using the Preclose technique has a low incidence of early and late complications related to the closure site.",

    "abstract": "This study retrospectively evaluated the technical and hemostatic outcomes of reconstructive and deconstructive endovascular management in patients with head and neck cancers associated with carotid blowout syndrome (CBS).\nTwenty-four patients with head and neck cancers with CBS involving the main trunk of carotid artery underwent endovascular therapy. This included reconstructive management with self-expandable stent grafts to preserve the diseased carotid artery in 11 patients and deconstructive management with balloons, coils, or acrylic adhesives to occlude the diseased carotid artery in 13 patients. Based on clinical severity and therapeutic priority, we classified CBS in our patients into two groups: acute or impending and threatened. The angiographic severity was graded from 0 to 3. Evaluation of technical outcome included technical success, initial and delayed complications, and patency of stent graft in the reconstructive group. The hemostatic outcome was evaluated by immediate hemostatic result, rebleeding, and duration of hemostasis. Sex, age, clinical and angiographic severities, local wound complications, and location of the pathologic lesion were examined as predictors of the technical and hemostatic outcomes of endovascular management by using Cox regression method.\nTechnical success and immediate hemostasis were achieved in all patients of both groups. Initial complications during the procedures were encountered in four patients (36.4%) who underwent reconstructive management and in one patient (7.7%) who underwent deconstructive management (P = .142). Delayed complications during the follow-up were seen in one patient (9.1%) with reconstructive management and one patient (7.7%) with deconstructive management (P > .99). Rebleeding occurred in five patients (45.5%) in the reconstructive management group and in three patients (23.1%) in the deconstructive management group (P = .659). The mean duration of hemostasis after initial reconstructive and deconstructive management was 4.0 +/- 8.1 and 8.5 +/- 10.1 months, respectively (P = .249). Rebleeding was noted in 7 of 11 patients (63.6%) with acute CBS and in 1 of 13 patients (7.7%) with impending and threatened CBS (P = .008).\nThere is no significant difference in technical and hemostatic outcomes between the reconstructive and deconstructive endovascular management methods. Hemostatic results were influenced by clinical severity. The rebleeding rate is higher in patients with advanced and acute clinical severity.",

    "abstract": "Our institution previously reported an association between elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and carotid artery stenosis. Based on this finding, we sought to further evaluate the association of CRP levels with ultrasound progression of carotid artery stenosis, and/or clinical events.\nA prospective observational study of patients evaluated for carotid artery stenosis was performed at a tertiary medical center from 2003-2007. Patients underwent serial lab draws for serum CRP, as well as serial duplex ultrasounds of their carotid bifurcations. Examinations were performed at 6-month intervals. Initial risk factors and CRP levels were evaluated with univariate statistics. Ultrasound progression of disease was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis.\nDuring the study period, 271 patients completed study requirements with a mean follow-up of 37 (+/-6) months. Initial duplex examination revealed 114 (41%) of patients had 0% to 15%, 94 (35%) had 16% to 49%, and 63 (23%) had 50% to 79% stenosis of the carotid bifurcation. Sixty-three patients (23%) demonstrated progression of disease by ultrasound examination, 27 (10%) progressed to carotid endarterectomy, and three (1%) experienced a stroke during follow-up. Mean CRP levels were higher among patients that progressed on duplex examination (6.7 +/- 1.28 vs 4.6 +/- 0.4 mg/dl, P < .05). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant difference in freedom from progression of carotid artery disease for patients with 1(st) and 3(rd) quartile CRP levels (log-rank test P < .05). Adjusting for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, coronary artery disease, aspirin or other anti-inflammatory uses, and statin therapy, 4(th) quartile CRP was independently associated with disease progression (OR 1.8, 95% CI; 1.03-2.99, P < .05).\nHigh CRP levels predict ultrasound progression of disease in patients with carotid artery stenosis. In addition, CRP levels may provide additional information to help guide ultimate therapy for evaluation and follow-up of patients with borderline lesions identified by duplex exam.",

    "abstract": "Management of lower extremity arterial disease with endovascular intervention is on the rise. Current practice patterns vary widely across and within specialty practices that perform endovascular intervention. This study evaluated reimbursement and costs of different approaches for offering endovascular intervention and identified strategies to improve cost-efficiency.\nThe medical records of all patients admitted to a university health system during 2005 for an endovascular intervention were retrospectively reviewed. Procedure type, setting, admission status, and financial data were recorded. Groups were compared using analysis of variance, Student t test for independent samples, and chi2.\nA total of 296 endovascular interventions were completed, and 184 (62%) met inclusion criteria. Atherectomy and stenting were significantly more costly when performed in the operating room than in the radiology suite: atherectomy, dollars 6596 vs dollars 4867 (P = .002); stent, dollars 5884 vs dollars 3292, (P < .001); angioplasty, dollars 2251 vs dollars 1881 (P = .46). Reimbursement was significantly higher for inpatient vs ambulatory admissions (P < .001). Costs were lowest when the endovascular intervention was done in the radiology suite on an ambulatory basis and highest when done as an inpatient in the operating room (dollars 5714 vs dollars 12,278; P < .001). Contribution margins were significantly higher for inpatients. Net profit was appreciated only for interventions done as an inpatient in the radiology suite. Reimbursement, contribution margins, and net profit were significantly lower among private pay patients in both the ambulatory and inpatient setting. The 30-day hospital readmission after ambulatory procedures was seven patients (6%).\nPractice patterns for endovascular interventions differ considerably. Costs vary by procedure and setting, and reimbursement depends on admission status and accurate documentation; these dynamics affect affordability. Organizing vascular services within a hub will ensure that care is delivered in the most cost-efficient manner. Guidelines may include designating the radiology suite as the primary venue for endovascular interventions because it is less costly than the operating room. Selective stenting policies should be considered. Contracts with private insurers must include carve-outs for stent costs and commensurate reimbursement for ambulatory procedures, and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT; American Medical Association, Chicago, Ill) coding must be proficient to make ambulatory endovascular interventions fiscally acceptable.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzed device-specific aneurysm sac morphology after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with low-permeability devices.\nBetween September 2004 and May 2006, 122 patients were treated with EVAR. Three different devices were implanted: 47 Zenith (Cook, Indianapolis, Ind), 46 AneuRx (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif) with Resilient Dacron Graft Material, and 29 Excluder (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) with low-porosity polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Patients were followed up at 1, 6, and 12 months and then biannually with computed tomography (CT) angiography. Standard axial two-dimensional CT measurements were obtained and compared with preoperative imaging. The preoperative scan served as a baseline, and the minor axis diameter, measured at the largest axial cut of the abdominal aortic aneurysm, was compared with the same measurement at follow-up.\nPatient age, sex, and preoperative aneurysm morphology were similar among groups. Patients receiving the Zenith endograft had a significantly larger neck diameter; however, there was no difference in the neck length between groups. The rate of type II endoleaks was similar for the Zenith (17%), AneuRx (17%), and Excluder (14%). At 1, 6, 12, and 18 months, all three grafts were associated with sac shrinkage. The resulting decreases in mean aneurysm size at 18 months and corresponding shrinkage were Zenith, 11%, 6.4 +/- 1.8 mm; AneuRx, 18.9%, 12.7 +/- 2.7 mm; and the Excluder, 5.5%, 3.3 +/- 0.9 (P < .05). The sac size in the 19 patients with a type II endoleak decreased 8.06% compared with a 15.43% decrease in sac size in patients without endoleak at 6 months. No significant sac expansion > or =5 mm has been observed among any of the groups to date.\nSac regression with all devices appears to have been favorably influenced by the new generation of graft materials and is improved compared with published reports of older generation graft materials for the AneuRx and Excluder. However, there is a trend toward greater sac regression with devices using Dacron vs PTFE. The relationship of aneurysm morphology and long-term effects on aortic stent grafts is yet to be determined.",

    "abstract": "This study compared postoperative patient comfort and the surgical outcome of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) or stripping of the great saphenous vein, both performed in conjunction with high ligation.\nThe study randomized 100 patients with primary trunk varicosities of the great saphenous vein (CEAP clinical class II to IV) to EVLA or stripping. The success of surgery was followed-up by duplex ultrasound imaging at 1, 4, and 16 weeks. Primary end points were the size of the hematoma 1 week after the operation and the preoperative disease-specific Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIVIQ) quality of life score compared with 4 weeks postoperatively. Secondary end points were postoperative symptoms (pain, use of analgesics, paresthesia at the ankle, residual hematoma), complications, time taken to resume work, the patient's satisfaction with the cosmetic outcome, and the CIVIQ quality of life score at 16 weeks.\nThe groups were well matched at baseline. In all, 95 patients could be followed up in accordance with the protocol. The treatment was successful in all patients. Endovenous laser ablation was associated with an occlusion rate of 100%. Hematomas were significantly smaller after EVLA (median [quartiles]) at 125 (55-180) cm(2) vs stripping 200 (123-269) cm(2) (P = .001). No difference was registered between groups for the CIVIQ quality of life score, with EVLA at -1.25 (-7.5-11.25) vs stripping at 4.38 (-5.94-14.38; P = .34). Several postoperative symptoms favored EVLA, but the only significant differences were seen in the minor side effects of surgery at 1 and 4 weeks and discomfort due to paresthesia at the ankle in the first postoperative week. EVLA was associated with a longer period of time until return to work (median [quartiles]) of 20 (14-25.5) days vs 14 (12.8-25) days (P = .054).\nEndovenous laser ablation combined with high ligation is safe and effective. Postoperative hematomas are significantly smaller than those after stripping. Short-term quality of life is at least as good as that after stripping. The long-term results warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The optimal prophylactic strategy and treatment regimen for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in hospitalized pediatric patients is not clearly established. This study assessed the incidence, risk factors, and treatment patterns for DVT among pediatric patients admitted to a hospital ward.\nChildren (aged <17 years) admitted to a single tertiary-care hospital during a 14-year period who developed or presented with DVT were retrospectively identified. Patient demographic and clinical data were analyzed retrospectively. Patients who developed DVT in the hospital were stratified according to the Wells clinical probability scoring system from criteria noted before the diagnosis. Treatment patterns and outcomes were evaluated between the two time intervals of 1992 to 2001 (group I) and 2002 to 2005 (group II).\nBetween 1992 and 2005, 358 children were evaluated for DVT, and 99 (52 boys, 47 girls) were admitted to the hospital and were determined to have DVT by confirmatory imaging. A prior DVT (12 total) was present in eight of the 21 patients admitted for DVT treatment; of the remaining, only seven received DVT prophylaxis on admission. In those developing a DVT, the inpatient clinical probability score was 21% (low), 40% (moderate), and 39% (high). The most common risk factor in those with prehospital DVT was a prior DVT (38%) or thrombophilic condition (33%), whereas inpatients had a central catheter (45%), with nearly 50% in the femoral vein. Children acquiring an inpatient DVT had concomitant severe respiratory (17%), oncologic (14%), and/or infectious (15%) diseases and required a prolonged intensive care unit (12.7 days) stay. Prehospital DVT was lower extremity predominant (90%) and statistically different from inpatient-acquired DVT (62%, P = .01). Treatment patterns between periods I and II revealed a trend to more low-molecular-weight heparin and less unfractionated heparin use (P = .09). Three patients died (one fatal pulmonary embolism). The number of recognized cases per 10,000 admissions increased from 0.3 to 28.8 from 1992 to 2005.\nThe incidence of DVT in hospitalized children is increasing. Those presenting with DVT typically have prior DVT, thrombophilia, or lower extremity disease. Our study suggests that children admitted with severe medical conditions who require a prolonged intensive care unit stay in addition to central venous access (especially via the femoral vein) should be considered candidates for DVT prophylaxis. A clinical probability scoring system alone cannot stratify patients sufficiently to forgo prophylaxis in hopes of a rapid clinical diagnosis. Childhood-specific level 1 trials aimed at determining guidelines for DVT prophylaxis are urgently required.",

    "abstract": "The use of a distal filter cerebral protection device with carotid artery stenting is commonplace. There is little evidence, however, that filters are effective in preventing embolic lesions. This study examined the incidence of embolic phenomenon during carotid artery stenting with and without filter use.\nThis was a prospective, randomized, single-center study of carotid artery stenting with or without a distal cerebral protection filter. A 1:1 scheme was used to randomize 36 carotid artery stenting procedures in 35 patients. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW MRI) 24 hours after stenting was used to assess the occurrence of new embolic lesions. Blinded observers calculated lesion number and volume.\nThe mean age was 78.6 +/- 7.0 in the cerebral protection group compared with 74.1 +/- 8.7 in the no cerebral protection group (P = .92). Despite similar average age, the percentage of octogenarians was higher in the cerebral protection group (61.1% vs 22.2%; P = .04). Two procedures in the cerebral protection group were not successful. One was completed without protection because of inability to track the filter, and the second was aborted because of severe tortuosity with a later carotid endarterectomy. New MRI lesions were noted in 72% of the cerebral protection group compared with 44% in the no cerebral protection group (P = .09). The average number of lesions in these patients was 6.1 and 6.2, respectively, with mean DW MRI lesion size of 16.63 mm(3) vs 15.61 mm(3) (P = .79 and .49, respectively). Four strokes occurred (11%), two in each group, in patients aged 75, 80, 82, and 84 years. The only major stroke occurred in the no cerebral protection group.\nThe use of filters during carotid artery stenting provided no demonstrable reduction of microemboli, as expected. Routine use of cerebral protection filters should undergo a more critical assessment before mandatory universal adoption.",

    "abstract": "This study retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of the 6F Angio-Seal (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, Minn) as a closure device for transbrachial artery access for endovascular procedures in diabetic patients with critical limb ischemia.\nFrom January 2005 and September 2007, 1887 diabetic patients underwent interventional procedures in the lower limbs at a two diabetic foot centers. Patients presented with rest pain (16%), ulcers (80%), or gangrene (4%). Systemic anticoagulation with sodium heparin (70 IU/kg) was obtained for all patients at the beginning of the endovascular treatment. A total of 249 brachial arteries (238 patients) were evaluated for possible Angio-Seal use after endovascular recanalization of the leg. Color Doppler ultrasound imaging of the artery was obtained before revascularization only in patients with previous Angio-Seal placement in the brachial artery. No further imaging studies were done in the remaining brachial arteries where the Angio-Seal was deployed at the operator's discretion. Impairment or disappearance of the radial pulse or onsets of hand ischemia or hand pain, or impairment of hand function during or at the end of the endovascular revascularization were all regarded as contraindications to Angio-Seal usage. Evidence of a highly calcified plaque of the brachial artery access site at the time of vessel puncture was regarded as an absolute contraindication to the Angio-Seal use. Patients were seen before discharge, at 1, 3, and 8 weeks after the procedure, and at 3-month intervals thereafter. Complications included hemorrhage, pseudoaneurysm, infection, and vessel occlusion.\nA total of 1947 Angio-Seal collagen plugs were deployed in 1709 diabetic patients (90.5%). The Angio-Seal was used for brachial artery closure in 159 patients (8.4%) in 161 procedures (159 in the left, 2 in the right brachial artery). In 79 patients (4.2%) in 88 procedures (87 in the left and 1 in the right brachial artery), the device was deemed contraindicated due to small vessel size in 73 patients (92.4%) or presence of calcium at the access site in five patients (6.3%). One patient (1.3%) refused the collagen plug closure after revascularization. The non-Angio-Seal group was evaluated for comparison. The success rate for achieving hemostasis in the Angio-Seal group was 96.9%. Five major complications (3.1%) at 30 days consisted of two puncture site hematomas >4 cm, two brachial artery occlusions, and one brachial artery pseudoaneurysm, with three patients requiring open surgery. Minor complications (7.50%) were three puncture site hematomas < 4 cm, three oozing of blood from the access site, and six patients had mild pain in the cubital fossa. No further complications were recorded in the 14-month follow-up (range 1-25 months) of a total of 140 patients.\nThis retrospective study shows that the 6F Angio-Seal is a valuable and safe vascular closure device for transbrachial access in diabetic patients undergoing interventional procedures for critical limb ischemia.",

The Angio-Seal was used for brachial artery closure in 159 patients (8.4%) in 161 procedures (159 in the left, 2 in the right brachial artery). In 79 patients (4.2%) in 88 procedures (87 in the left and 1 in the right brachial artery), the device was deemed contraindicated due to small vessel size in 73 patients (92.4%) or presence of calcium at the access site in five patients (6.3%). One patient (1.3%) refused the collagen plug closure after revascularization. The non-Angio-Seal group was evaluated for comparison. The success rate for achieving hemostasis in the Angio-Seal group was 96.9%. Five major complications (3.1%) at 30 days consisted of two puncture site hematomas >4 cm, two brachial artery occlusions, and one brachial artery pseudoaneurysm, with three patients requiring open surgery. Minor complications (7.50%) were three puncture site hematomas < 4 cm, three oozing of blood from the access site, and six patients had mild pain in the cubital fossa.

    "abstract": "Lower extremity arterial injury is a rare complication following total knee (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). To date, no multi-institutional study has identified preoperative factors that may portend increased risk for these injuries. We queried a large clinical database for the incidence and predictors of arterial injury and/or compromise following lower extremity arthroplasty.\nProspectively collected preoperative and postoperative data by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) of the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers were analyzed. All patients from 1996 to 2003 in the NSQIP database who underwent TKA or THA were identified via CPT codes. NSQIP defined, 30-day, postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Data were compared using bivariable analysis, as well as limited multivariable logistic regression.\nA total of 41,633 arthroplasties (24,029 TKA, 2077 redo-TKA, 13,494 THA, 2033 redo-THA) were identified in the NSQIP database. A total of 34 (0.08%) lower extremity arterial injuries were recognized (0.08% TKA, 0.19% redo-TKA, 0.04% THA, 0.20% redo-THA). Eighteen injuries were repaired on the same day of surgery (seven intraop, 11 postop), eight between postoperative days 1 and 5, and 8 between days 6 and 30. Only two patients underwent lower extremity amputation (overall limb loss rate of 5.9% of patients who had arterial injury). Statistically significant predictors of lower extremity arterial injury identified on logistic regression analysis included redo procedure (odds ratio [OR] 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-6.0, P = .013) and African American race (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-5.3, P = .02).\nLower extremity arterial injury was exceedingly rare after total knee or total hip arthroplasty. There is an increased incidence in African American patients and those undergoing redo arthroplasty. Among patients who sustain vascular injury, excellent limb salvage rates can be achieved with close postoperative surveillance to achieve early detection and repair of injuries.",

Aorto-iliac aneurysm repair under cPK selective hypothermic perfusion was successfully accomplished in all cases. All the cPK arteries were spared and were selectively reimplanted when required. No major complications or death were reported at long-term follow-up. Open surgical repair of aorto-iliac aneurysm in patients with cPK is safe and effective and, in our short series, we observed no worsening of the renal function; besides, we reported a persistent improvement of the renal function in two out of the four cases.",

Blood samples showed a leukocyte count of 10.9 x 10(9)/l and a C-reactive protein of 239 mg/l. The computed tomography (CT)-scan showed fluid collections behind the proximal part of the endovascular graft and dorsal to the aorta. CT-guided translumbar needle aspiration of these collections yielded growth with Listeria monocytogenes. Prosthetic endograft infection is an extremely rare event, especially when it is caused by L. monocytogenes. Given the scarcity of this complication, no consensus has been reached for its treatment. In the described case, radiological drainage and prolonged antibiotic treatment resulted in favourable outcome at midterm follow-up with preservation of the endograft.",

    "abstract": "Vein wall endothelial turnover after stasis deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has not been well characterized. The purpose of this study was to quantify re-endothelialization after DVT and determine if low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) therapy affects this process.\nStasis DVT was generated in the rat by inferior vena cava ligation, with harvest at 1, 4, and 14 days. Immunohistologic quantification of vascular smooth muscle cells and luminal endothelialization was estimated by positive staining for alpha-smooth muscle actin and von Willebrand factor, respectively. In separate experiments, rats were treated either before or after DVT with subcutaneous LMWH (3 mg/kg daily) until harvesting at 4 and 14 days. The inferior vena cava was processed for histologic analysis or was processed for organ culture after the thrombus was gently removed. The vein wall was stimulated in vitro with interleukin-1beta (1 ng/mL), and the supernatant was processed at 48 hours for nitric oxide. Cells were processed by real-time polymerase chain reaction for endothelial nitric oxide synthase, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, and thrombomodulin at 4 and 14 days, and collagen I and III at 14 days. Comparisons were done with analysis of variance or t test. A P < .05 was significant.\nThrombus size peaked at 4 days, whereas luminal re-endothelialization increased over time (1 day, 11% +/- 2%; 4 days, 23% +/- 4%; 14 days, 64% +/- 7% (+) von Willebrand factor staining; P < .01, n = 3 to 4, compared with non-DVT control). Similarly, vascular smooth muscle cell staining was lowest at day 1 and gradually returned to baseline by 14 days. Both before and after DVT, LMWH significantly increased luminal re-endothelialization, without a difference in thrombus size at 4 days, but no significant difference was noted at 14 days despite smaller thrombi with LMWH treatment. Pretreatment with LMWH was associated with increased vascular smooth muscle cell area and recovery of certain inducible endothelial specific genes. No significant difference in nitric oxide levels in the supernatant was found at 4 days. At 14 days, type III collagen was significantly elevated with LMWH treatment.\nVenous re-endothelialization occurs progressively as the DVT resolves and can be accelerated with LMWH treatment, although this effect appears limited to the early time frame. These findings may have clinical relevance for LMWH timing and treatment compared with mechanical forms of therapy.\nHow the vein wall endothelium responds after deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has not been well documented owing to limited human specimens. This report shows that low-molecular-weight heparin accelerates or protects the endothelium and preserves medial smooth muscle cell integrity after DVT, but that this effect is limited to a relatively early time period. Although most DVT prophylaxis is pharmacologic (a heparin agent), use of nonpharmacologic measures is also common. The use of heparin prophylaxis, compared with after DVT treatment, and the acceleration of post-DVT re-endothelialization require clinical correlation.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to evaluate the ability of recombinant human thrombomodulin (rTM) to inhibit neointimal hyperplasia when bound to expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) stent grafts placed in a porcine balloon injured carotid artery model.\nThe left carotid artery of male pigs, weighing 25 to 30 Kg, was injured with an angioplasty balloon. Two weeks later either a non-coated standard ePTFE stent graft (Viabahn, 6 x 25 mm, W. L. Gore & Associates) or a rTM coated stent graft was implanted into the balloon-injured segment using an endovascular technique. Carotid angiography was performed at the time of the balloon injury, two weeks later and then at 4 weeks to assess the degree of luminal stenosis. One month after stent graft deployment, the grafts were explanted following in situ perfusion fixation for histological analysis. The specimens were then cross-sectioned into proximal, middle and distal segments, and the residual arterial lumen and intimal to media (I/M) ratios were calculated with computerized planimetry.\nrTM binding onto ePTFE-grafts was confirmed by functional activation of protein C and histopathology with immuno-scanning electron microscopy, backscatter electron emission imaging and x-ray microanalysis. All seven of the rTM coated stent grafts and six of the seven uncoated stent grafts were patent at the time of explantation. The mean luminal diameter of the rTM coated stents was 93% +/- 2.0% of the original diameter, compared with 67% +/- 23% (P = .006) in the control group. Histological analysis demonstrated that the area obliterated by intimal hyperplasia at the proximal portion of the rTM stent was -27% compared with the control group: (2.73 +/- 0.69 mm(2), vs 3.47 +/- 0.67 mm(2), P <.05).\nNeointimal hyperplasia is significantly inhibited in ePTFE stent grafts coated with rTM compared with uncoated grafts, as documented by improved luminal diameter by angiography and by computerized planimetry measurements of residual lumen area. These findings suggest that binding of recombinant human thrombomodulin onto ePTFE grafts may improve the long-term patency of covered stents grafts.\nDecrease of neointimal hyperplasia of the magnitude observed in this study could significantly improve blood flow and patency of small caliber prosthetic grafts. If the durability of these results can be confirmed by long-term studies, this technique may prove useful in preventing graft stenosis and arterial thrombosis following angioplasty or vascular bypass procedures.",

    "abstract": "The vascular mediator, nitric oxide regulates vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and can react with superoxide to form peroxynitrite, a highly reactive free radical. The intracellular mechanisms by which nitric oxide and peroxynitrite inhibit smooth muscle cell growth remain undefined, as is the potential role of peroxynitrite formation in the antiproliferative effects of nitric oxide. We sought to define the intracellular effects and signaling mechanisms of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite in smooth muscle cells.\nCultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells were treated with exogenous nitric oxide or peroxynitrite and inhibitors of nitric oxide and redox signaling pathways. Cell growth, DNA synthesis, apoptosis, cyclic guanosine 3'-5' monophosphate (cGMP) levels, poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity, and cytotoxicity were assayed. Peroxynitrite formation was determined by nitrotyrosine immunoblotting. Vasoreactivity was assessed in isolated rat aortic rings after treatment with nitric oxide/peroxynitrite and redox agents.\nBoth exogenous nitric oxide and peroxynitrite decreased cell growth and DNA synthesis of cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells, but peroxynitrite-induced growth arrest was irreversible and associated with apoptosis and cytotoxicity. Inhibition of guanylate cyclase, PARP activity, mitogen-activated protein kinase, or bypass of ornithine decarboxylase did not reverse growth arrest by nitric oxide. The antioxidants N-acetylcysteine, ascorbate, and glutathione selectively reversed growth inhibition by nitric oxide but not by peroxynitrite. Antioxidants did not impair nitric oxide-induced cGMP generation in smooth muscle cells or nitric oxide-induced vasodilatation of isolated aortic rings. Nitric oxide treatment did not result in peroxynitrite formation and augmentation of superoxide levels did not induce peroxynitrite-like effects. Peroxynitrite-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis were not reversed by antioxidants or PARP inhibition, because peroxynitrite activated PARP in J774 macrophages but failed to activate PARP in smooth muscle cells.\nExogenous nitric oxide induces reversible cytostasis in smooth muscle cells by a redox-sensitive mechanism independent of peroxynitrite formation and distinct from the nitric oxide vasodilating mechanism. Peroxynitrite does not activate PARP selectively in smooth muscle cells and induces redox-independent smooth muscle cell cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Thus, the antiproliferative effects of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite on smooth muscle cells use divergent intracellular pathways with distinct redox sensitivities. These findings are relevant to the pathogenesis of vascular disease and the potential application of nitric oxide-based therapy for vascular disease.\nVascular smooth muscle cell proliferation is an important component of atherosclerosis, vein graft failure, and arterial restenosis, and is known to be regulated by the vascular signaling molecule nitric oxide. Nitric oxide can combine with the free radical superoxide to form the unstable metabolite peroxynitrite, which has been detected in human vascular lesions. This study examines the role of peroxynitrite in mediating the antiproliferative effects of nitric oxide. We identify important differences in the effects and intracellular mechanisms of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite in regulating vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and programmed cell death. Defining the differential effects of these free radicals in vascular cells is important to our understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular disease and the development of novel therapy aimed at treating proliferative vascular lesions.",

The antioxidants N-acetylcysteine, ascorbate, and glutathione selectively reversed growth inhibition by nitric oxide but not by peroxynitrite. Antioxidants did not impair nitric oxide-induced cGMP generation in smooth muscle cells or nitric oxide-induced vasodilatation of isolated aortic rings. Nitric oxide treatment did not result in peroxynitrite formation and augmentation of superoxide levels did not induce peroxynitrite-like effects. Peroxynitrite-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis were not reversed by antioxidants or PARP inhibition, because peroxynitrite activated PARP in J774 macrophages but failed to activate PARP in smooth muscle cells.",

    "abstract": "Early failure (within 6 weeks of construction) of prosthetic arteriovenous access (AVA) is traditionally treated by surgical revision rather than endovascular intervention because it is assumed to be related to technical factors related to the surgery. This premise is not evidence based and our results for surgical thrombectomy have been poor. Based on our previous experience with angiography and thrombolysis in newly constructed autogenous AVAs, we changed our approach to perform endovascular thrombolysis initially, instead of proceeding directly to surgical revision.\nWe prospectively studied all patients who had an early failure of new prosthetic AVA from January 2000 to June 2004 to determine the cause of and treat the occlusions by endovascular means. Thrombolysis took place at least 7 days after surgery, allowing sufficient tissue incorporation to prevent puncture site bleeding. No patients were excluded from the study.\nDuring the 54 months of the study, 269 prosthetic AVAs were constructed at our center. Twenty patients had early occlusion. The mean time from creation of the prosthetic AVA to occlusion was 15.8 +/- 10.9 (median 13, range 3-41) days and the mean time to intervention was 25.0 +/- 11.6 (median 21, range 9-54) days. Of the 20 patients, 17 underwent successful endovascular thrombolysis. The only patient of the 20 found to have a technical problem related to surgery had this resolved angiographically. There was one complication in a patient with failed endovascular thrombolysis, who had extravasation from the arterial anastomosis that halted the procedure. This patient later had surgical revision in keeping with the angiographic findings. Cumulative patency rates at 6 months and 1 year were 75% and 68%, respectively.\nEndovascular thrombolysis for early occlusion of prosthetic AVAs is feasible, safe, and is associated with a good patency rate. It appears to be a better initial approach than surgical revision in these patients because technical-surgical problems related to AVA construction are rare.",

    "abstract": "To compare the clinical outcome between ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) and ultrasound-guided liquid form sclerotherapy (UGLS) in patients with venous malformations (VM).\nEighty-nine patients with symptomatic VM were treated with ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy. There were 22 males and 67 females with mean age of 14.5 years. The sclerosing agents used were 1% polidocanol (POL) or 10% ethanolamine oleate (EO). POL was injected predominantly into smaller, superficial lesions, whereas EO was used for large, deeper lesions. Foam sclerosing solution was provided using Tessari's method. Patients were randomized to receive either UGFS or UGLS. Post-sclerotherapy surveillance was done at 6 months after last session using duplex ultrasound. Findings obtained by duplex scanning were divided into four groups: (1) disappeared group: the venous space was occluded and was totally shrunk; (2) partially recanalized group: the venous space was partially recanalized and was partially shrunk; (3) totally recanalized group: the venous space was totally recanalized and returned at the same size; and (4) worsened group: the venous space was totally recanalized and became worse.\nForty-nine patients were treated with UGFS and the remaining 40 were treated with UGLS. There were no significant differences in age and men:women ratio. There was no significant difference in the anatomic distribution of VMs between the two groups. The amount of POL was significantly smaller in patients who were treated with UGFS (P = .022). Similarly, there was a significant reduction in the use of EO in patients treated with UGFS (P = .005). The proportion of VM with total disappearance and partial recanalization was significantly higher in patients treated with UGFS (P = .002). No major complications related to sclerotherapy were encountered in both groups.\nThese findings suggest that UGFS could have greater promise compared with UGLS in the treatment of VMs.",

    "abstract": "The management of venous trauma remains controversial. Critics of venous repair have cited an increased incidence of associated venous thromboembolic events with this management. We analyzed the current treatment of wartime venous injuries in United States military personnel in an effort to answer this question.\nFrom December 1, 2001, to October 31, 2005, all United States casualties with named venous injuries were evaluated. A retrospective review of a clinical database was performed on demographics, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, treatment, outcomes, and venous thromboembolic events. Data were analyzed using the Fisher exact test, analysis of variance, and logarithmic transformation.\nDuring this 5-year period, 82 patients sustained 103 named venous injuries due to combat operations. All patients were male, with an average age of 27.9 years (range, 20.3-58.3 years). Blast injuries accounted for 54 venous injuries (65.9%), gunshot wounds for 25 (30.5%), and motor vehicle accidents for 3 (3.6%). The venous injury was isolated in 28 patients (34.1%), and 16 (19.5%) had multiple venous injuries. The venous injury in two patients was associated with acute phlegmasia, with fractures in 33 (40.2%), and 22 (28.1%) sustained neurologic deficits. Venous injuries were treated by ligation in 65 patients (63.1%) and by open surgical repair in 38 (36.9%). Postoperative extremity edema occurred in all patients irrespective of method of management. Thrombosis after venous repair occurred in six of the 38 cases (15.8%). Pulmonary emboli developed in three patients, one after open repair and two after ligation (P > .99).\nIn the largest review of military venous trauma in more than three decades, we found no difference in the incidence of venous thromboembolic complications between venous injuries managed by open repair vs ligation. Blast injuries of the extremities have caused most of the venous injuries. Ligation is the most common modality of treatment in combat zones. Long-term morbidity associated with venous injuries and their management will be assessed in future follow-up studies.",

    "abstract": "It is generally accepted that failed infrainguinal bypass with prosthetic material significantly compromises arterial run off, which may limit future revascularization. It is well known that the negative consequences of early vein graft thrombosis are limited, but the effect of failed peripheral angioplasty on the distal vasculature is poorly studied. The purpose of this study was to determine whether early failure after superficial femoral artery intervention influences subsequent revascularization options.\nBetween July 1, 1998, and June 30, 2006, 276 patients underwent endovascular intervention of the superficial femoral artery. A prospective analysis of angiograms done before the intervention and after early failure (<or=200 days) was performed in a blinded fashion by three attending vascular surgeons to determine the optimal distal bypass site if an operation were to be performed. Inter-rater reliability of the angiogram scores was assessed using the Fleiss generalized kappa for multiple raters. Potential distal anastomotic sites were classified as above knee popliteal, below knee popliteal, tibial, or no adequate site. A consensus classification was determined for each patient (2 of 3 raters).\nOf the 276 patients who underwent endovascular intervention of the superficial femoral artery, early failure was noted in 24 limbs in 23 patients. Angiographic records were available for 21 limbs in 20 patients (60% men; mean age, 65.3 +/- 11.3 years), of which 60% had critical limb ischemia, 40% had claudication, and 65% had diabetes. The distal bypass site was altered in six limbs (28.6%); four from popliteal to tibial and two from above knee to below knee popliteal. Inter-rater reliability was 0.54 (moderate/good). The procedures performed on these early failures were percutaneous transluminal angioplasty +/- stent (n = 14), infrainguinal bypass (n = 5), and no treatment (n = 1). Only 0.4% (1 of 276) of patients required major limb amputation due to early failure of a superficial femoral artery intervention.\nEarly failure after isolated endovascular intervention of the superficial femoral artery is infrequent and alters the distal target in 30% of early-failure patients if open bypass is planned. Salvage with repeat angioplasty, if necessary, can be accomplished in most patients, and the need for limb amputation is exceedingly rare. The early failure results in this study support a more liberal application of endovascular intervention to the superficial femoral artery in patients with lower extremity ischemia, especially claudication. The repercussions of late endovascular failure as well as the effects of disease progression need further study.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed the Veterans Affairs (VA) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), a large clinical database, to investigate which factors, other than technical, were associated with a higher incidence of early graft failure in infrainguinal bypass.\nData are prospectively collected in NSQIP from 123 participating VA Medical Centers. All patients from 1995 to 2003 in the NSQIP database who underwent infrainguinal arterial bypass were identified by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes (CPT is a registered trademark of the American Medical Association, Chicago, Ill, Copyright 2007). Data for 30-day graft failure were evaluated by univariate analysis, and multivariate logistic regression was used to control for possible confounders.\nThe NSQIP database identified 14,788 patients who underwent infrainguinal lower extremity arterial bypasses during the study period, and 723 acute graft failures (4.9%) occurred. On multivariate analysis, compared with patients aged >70 years, patient ages of <50 and 51 to 60 years were significantly associated with early graft failure (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-3.0; P < .001; OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6, P < .001; respectively); age range of 61 to 70 years was not significantly associated with early graft failure. African American race was also associated with early graft failure, and diabetes mellitus had a negative association with early graft failure (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3-1.5; P < .001; OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58-0.89; P = .002; respectively). Although smoking was a significant factor for acute graft failure on univariate analysis, it was not significant on multivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis of the type of procedure performed revealed that femoral to popliteal bypass with vein or prosthetic graft was associated with better early graft patency than any of the tibial vessel bypass procedures except for popliteal to tibial bypass with autogenous vein.\nThese data suggest that factors other than technique have an effect on the 30-day graft failure rates of infrainguinal bypasses. These results help the vascular surgeon to predict more accurately early bypass failure rates while planning the procedure and counseling patients about its prognosis.",

On multivariate analysis, compared with patients aged >70 years, patient ages of <50 and 51 to 60 years were significantly associated with early graft failure (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-3.0; P < .001; OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6, P < .001; respectively); age range of 61 to 70 years was not significantly associated with early graft failure. African American race was also associated with early graft failure, and diabetes mellitus had a negative association with early graft failure (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3-1.5; P < .001; OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58-0.89; P = .002; respectively). Although smoking was a significant factor for acute graft failure on univariate analysis, it was not significant on multivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis of the type of procedure performed revealed that femoral to popliteal bypass with vein or prosthetic graft was associated with better early graft patency than any of the tibial vessel bypass procedures except for popliteal to tibial bypass with autogenous vein.",

    "abstract": "Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) is an effective method of leg inflow enhancement and amelioration of claudication in patients with peripheral arterial disease. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of IPC in patients with chronic critical limb ischemia, tissue loss, and nonhealing wounds of the foot after limited foot surgery (toe or transmetatarsal amputation) on whom additional arterial revascularization had been exhausted.\nPerformed in a community and multidisciplinary health care clinic (1998 through 2004), this retrospective study comprises 2 groups. Group 1 (IPC group) consisted of 24 consecutive patients, median age 70 years (interquartile range [IQR], 68.7-71.3) years, who received IPC for tissue loss and nonhealing amputation wounds of the foot attributable to critical limb ischemia in addition to wound care. Group 2 (control group) consisted of 24 consecutive patients, median age 69 years (IQR, 65.7-70.3 years), who received wound care for tissue loss and nonhealing amputation wounds of the foot due to critical limb ischemia, without use of IPC. Stringent exclusion criteria applied. Group allocation of patients depended solely on their willingness to undergo IPC therapy. Vascular assessment included determination of the resting ankle-brachial pressure index, transcutaneous oximetry (TcPO(2)), duplex graft surveillance, and foot radiography. Outcome was considered favorable if complete healing and limb salvage occurred, and adverse if the patient had to undergo a below knee amputation subsequent to failure of wound healing. Follow-up was 18 months. Wound care consisted of weekly d\u00e9bridement and biologic dressings. IPC was delivered at an inflation pressure of 85 to 95 mm Hg, applied for 2 seconds with rapid rise (0.2 seconds), 3 cycles per minute; three 2-hourly sessions per day were requested. Compliance was closely monitored.\nBaseline differences in demography, cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes mellitus, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, renal impairment), and severity of peripheral arterial disease (ankle-brachial indices, TcPO(2), prior arterial reconstruction) were not significant. The types of local foot amputation that occurred in the two groups were not significantly different. In the control group, foot wounds failed to heal in 20 patients (83%) and they underwent a below knee amputation; the remaining four (17%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59%-32.7%) had complete healing and limb salvage. In the IPC group, 14 patients (58%, 95% CI, 37.1%-79.6%) had complete foot wound healing and limb salvage, and 10 (42%) underwent below knee amputation for nonhealing foot wounds. Wound healing and limb salvage were significantly better in the IPC group (P < .01, chi(2)). Compared with the IPC group, the odds ratio of limb loss in the control group was 7.0. On study completion, TcPO(2) on sitting was higher in the IPC group than in the control group (P = .0038).\nIPC used as an adjunct to wound care in patients with chronic critical limb ischemia and nonhealing amputation wounds/tissue loss improves the likelihood of wound healing and limb salvage when established treatment alternatives in current practice are lacking. This controlled study adds to the momentum of IPC clinical efficacy in critical limb ischemia set by previously published case series, compelling the pursuit of large scale multicentric level 1 studies to substantiate its actual clinical role, relative indications, and to enhance our insight into the pertinent physiologic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Independent audits have been proposed to improve carotid endarterectomy (CEA) effectiveness. This study used the online registry Modification of Outcomes by Lowering Ischemic Events after Reconstruction of Extracranial Vessels (MOLIERE) to evaluate the effectiveness of CEA in the Province of Quebec. The concept of MOLIERE is that surgeon involvement in a prospective manner is a prerequisite for them to evaluate, compare, and improve their practice.\nAll Quebec surgeons who performed CEA were invited to participate in this study sponsored by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des sciences vasculaires du Qu\u00e9bec, the Canadian Society for Vascular Surgery and the Association des chirurgiens vasculaires du Qu\u00e9bec. Surgeons prospectively entered data for 60 variables relevant to CEA in an online, secure, and confidential database between May 24, 2004, and May 31, 2005. Patient inclusion had to occur before surgery. After the study was completed, charts of all CEAs performed in each participating center were reviewed to validate the results of MOLIERE. For each participating institution, results of CEA that were not entered in the registry were also reviewed.\nA total of 279 patients (mean age, 69 years; range, 46-91 years) undergoing a CEA were enrolled in MOLIERE by 23 surgeons from 10 institutions in Quebec; 157 (56%) were symptomatic, and 122 (44%) were asymptomatic. Carotid endarterectomies were performed with patch angioplasty in 252 (89%), primary closure in 24 (9%), and by eversion in six (2%). Follow-up at 30 days was achieved for all patients. The 30-day stroke or death rates for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were 3.2% (5 of 157, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2%-7.4%) and 0%. Validation was excellent for patients who were entered in the registry, with no additional deaths or strokes than those reported by the surgeons. The validation process revealed that participating surgeons entered 66% (279 of 424) of their patients in the registry. Indications and stroke or death rates (SDRs) for those patients who were not entered in the registry were not statistically different (symptomatic, 54% [79 of 145]; SDR of 1.3% [1 of 76] for symptomatic and 1.5% [1 of 66] for asymptomatic). In participating institutions, 11 surgeons did not participate. The SDRs for patients operated on by nonparticipating surgeons were higher but not statistically different than rates for patients operated on by participating surgeons (3.7% [5 of 136] vs 1.7% [7 of 424], P = .16). There was a trend toward higher stroke rate for patients operated on by nonparticipating surgeons (3.7% [5 of 136] vs 1.2% [5 of 424], P = .056). Mean postoperative length of stay was statistically higher for patients operated on by nonparticipating surgeons (4.7 vs 3.4 days, P = .046). The SDRs were adequate for all surgeons in participating centers, with 95% CI within accepted standards for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.\nMOLIERE is the first Canadian online prospective registry allowing surgeons to audit CEA results. The SDRs for participating surgeons were valid and within standards. Scientific vascular societies played a key role in supporting this project. Such audits allow surgeons and medical stroke experts to examine the appropriateness and results of CEAs in their institutions to improve them. The future of MOLIERE is in validation of its concept, increased participation by surgeons, and integration of a multidisciplinary approach.",

    "abstract": "Macrophage infiltration and expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) are markers of high-risk atherosclerotic carotid plaques and strong indicators of plaque instability. Use of statins is associated with a decreased risk of stroke and reportedly improves stability of atherosclerotic plaques, but available data addressing the mechanism of this effect are conflicting.\nWe retrospectively analyzed data from 94 consecutive patients with internal carotid artery stenosis who underwent carotid endarterectomy. Excised plaques underwent systematic quantitative immunohistochemical analysis to determine the percentage of macrophage area and the percentage of MMP-9 area. Associations between percentage of macrophage area and percentage of MMP-9 area and use of statins and cerebrovascular disease were examined by univariate and multivariate analysis.\nWe found significantly higher values of percentage of macrophage area and of MMP-9 area in recently symptomatic (n = 26) compared with asymptomatic (n = 68) internal carotid artery stenoses: median (IQR) percentage of macrophage area was 2.29 (1.53-4.129) vs 0.53 (0.27-0.96) and percentage of MMP-9 area was 0.61 (0.36-0.89) vs 0.08 (0.02-0.27; both P < .0005). Patients treated with statins (n = 49) showed lower percentage values of macrophage area and MMP-9 area than untreated patients: the percentage of macrophage area was 0.54 (0.31-1.18) vs 1.03 (0.57-2.08; P = .01) and percentage of MMP-9 area was 0.06 (0.02-0.22) vs 0.36 (0.16-0.62; P < .0005). These associations between statin treatment and percentages of macrophage area and MMP-9 area did not change after controlling for symptomatic cerebrovascular disease and the effects of other potential confounders in multivariable analysis.\nOur results confirm the value of percentage of macrophage area and percentage of MMP-9 area as markers of plaque instability and provide further evidence to support the hypothesis that statins reduce inflammatory responses and thereby stabilize carotid atherosclerotic plaques.",

    "abstract": "Device cost is a substantial component of the overall cost of endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair (EVAR), and the four commercially available devices differ significantly in the cost of their basic configuration. This study examined the impact of three different endografts and their product lines on the overall cost of repair.\nImplant records of 467 EVAR procedures performed during 2000 through 2006 were reviewed. The three devices used were the AneuRx in 178 (38.1%; Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Ca), the Excluder in 123 (26.3%; W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz), and the Zenith in 166 (35.5%; the Cook Zenith (Bloomington, Ind). The Powerlink device (Endologix, Irvine, Calif) was not studied. The specific device implanted was determined by its commercial availability at the time of repair, patient anatomy, and surgeon preference. Retail list prices were used for all calculations, and only devices used during the original repair were used for analysis.\nThe device cost of the most basic configuration for repair (ie, 2 pieces for AneuRx and Excluder, 3 pieces for Zenith) differed by $3022 between the most expensive (Zenith) to the least expensive (AneuRx). However, the AneuRx system required the most number of extensions (1.90 +/- 1.25 per case; range, 0-7), whereas the Zenith required the fewest (0.21 +/- 0.51 per case; range, 0-3). When the costs of the extensions were added, the overall mean device costs per case were similar.\nThe initial cost advantage of the AneuRx and Excluder endograft systems were offset by the more frequent need for proximal and distal extensions. The minimum device cost of a basic repair should not factor into the decision to select one specific device over another because additional devices may be required depending on the design and construction of the endograft system and the accuracy and reliability of their deployment mechanisms.",

Group A (22 patients; creatinine clearance, 64.2 +/- 8.1 mL/min) received 50 mL of the contrast agent. Group B (23 patients; creatinine clearance, 89.4 +/- 7.3 mL/min) received 100 mL of the contrast agent. The injection rate was 3.5 mL/s, followed by 30 mL of saline at 3.5 mL/s. Studies were performed on the same 64-detector computed tomography scanner using a real-time bolus-tracking technique. Quantitative analysis was performed by determination of mean vascular attenuation at 10 regions of interest from the suprarenal aorta to the common femoral artery by one reader blinded to type and amount of contrast agent and compared using the Student t test. Image quality according to a 4-point scale was assessed in consensus by two readers blinded to type and amount of contrast medium and compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Multivariable adjustments were performed using ordinal regression analysis.\nMean total attenuation did not differ significantly between both groups (196.5 +/- 33.0 Hounsfield unit [HU] in group A and 203.1 +/- 44.2 HU in group B; P = .57 by univariate and P > .05 by multivariable analysis). Accordingly, attenuation at each region of interest was not significantly different (P > .35). Image quality was excellent or good in all patients. No significant differences in visual assessment were found comparing both contrast medium protocols (P > .05 by univariate and by multivariable analysis).\nAortoiliac aneurysm imaging can be performed with substantially reduced amounts of contrast medium using 64-detector computed tomography angiography technology.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) is emerging as a therapeutic option for patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia. This study evaluated patency and mortality, and their relationship between degree of vessel occlusion (stenotic or totally occluded), stent characteristics, and comorbidities in patients who were treated with PTAS of the visceral vessels for chronic mesenteric ischemia.\nA retrospective review was performed of the records of all patients who underwent PTAS of the celiac, superior mesenteric, or inferior mesenteric arteries, or both, for symptomatic chronic mesenteric ischemia between January 2001 and December 2005. Patient demographics, lesion characteristics (stenosis or occlusion), interventional details, and early and late mortality rates were recorded. Cumulative mortality and patency rates and factors associated with outcomes were determined using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards modeling.\nEighty-seven mesenteric vessels (57 superior mesenteric, 23 celiac, and 7 inferior mesenteric arteries) were treated in 65 patients (29 men and 36 women). Completely occluded vessels were treated in 18 patients (28%), and >60% stenosis was treated in 47 patients (72%). Mesenteric angina was the most common symptom (97%). For the entire series, the cumulative 1-year results were primary patency, 65% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50%-80%); primary assisted patency, 97% (95% CI, 92%-100%); secondary patency, 99% (95% CI, 96%-100%); and survival, 89% (95% CI, 80%-98%). All deaths occurred <or=60 days after treatment. The endovascular treatment of visceral artery occlusion was not associated with diminished patency or survival, irrespective of stent size or number. Patients requiring bowel resection were less likely to survive than those who did not (odds ratio [OR], 26; 95% CI, 3.5-192; P < .001). One-year primary patency was worse among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.4-7.7; P = .009) or who had femoral access (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1-7.9; P = .015).\nFor patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia, the results of endovascular treatment of occluded mesenteric arteries are indistinguishable from those treated for stenotic vessels. Patients requiring bowel resection are less likely to survive, and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or who had femoral access have higher reintervention rates.",

The primary objective was to evaluate perioperative efficacy (incidence of thromboembolic ischemic stroke). The secondary objective was to evaluate safety, including avoidance of hematoma at the site of surgery, gastrointestinal bleeding, rate of blood transfusions, and occurrence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.\nFrom July 2005 to June 2006, 338 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were enrolled; of these, 115 patients did not fulfill inclusion criteria, and 63 patients refused to participate. The remaining 160 patients were assigned in a 3:1 randomization to receive enoxaparin (0.5 mg/kg) or unfractionated heparin (5000 IU) intraoperatively as an intravenous bolus (120 and 40 patients, respectively). The mean patient age was 70.3 years (range, 43.3-94.7 years), and 54 were women. Internal carotid artery stenosis was asymptomatic in 55% and symptomatic in 45%. The difference in baseline characteristics between these groups was not significant. The rate of cerebral embolic events was 0.8% in the enoxaparin group (n = 1) and 2.5% in the unfractionated heparin group (n = 1). The rate of severe bleeding complications was 1.7% in the enoxaparin group (n = 2) and 5% in the unfractionated heparin group (n = 2; P > .05). No case of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was observed.\nThis pilot study found no difference between enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin during carotid endarterectomy in perioperative bleeding or embolic events.

    "abstract": "Previous reports indicate that the prevalence and severity of carotid stenoses is greater in peripheral artery disease (PAD) than in coronary artery disease (CAD). To date, no study has compared these two populations with respect to plaque echogenicity, which is an independent risk factor for cerebrovascular events.\nIn 43 PAD patients without CAD and in 43 CAD patients without PAD, carotid plaques were studied with high-resolution B-mode ultrasound and by computerized measurement of the gray-scale median.\nAt visual analysis, the prevalence of hypoechoic plaques was 39.5% in PAD and 18.6% in CAD (P = .033). The corresponding values for gray-scale median analysis were 34.9% and 14.0% (P = .024). At multivariate analysis, PAD patients showed a greater risk of having hypoechoic plaques than CAD patients at visual (odds ratio [OR], 4.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-15.92, P = .025) and gray-scale median analysis (OR, 5.13; 95% CI, 1.27-20.67; P = .021). This association was no longer significant when neutrophil number was included among the covariates. In this model, only an increased neutrophil count was associated with hypoechoic plaques (P < .01 for both visual and gray-scale median analysis). Indeed, neutrophil count was greater in PAD than in CAD (4.4 +/- 1.0 vs 3.9 +/- 1.2 10(9)/L, P = .030). The concordance between visual typing of carotid plaques and gray-scale median measurement was good (rho = 0.714, P < .01).\nCompared with CAD patients, those with PAD, in addition to a greater atherosclerotic burden, may have characteristics of instability of carotid plaques that, in turn, may result in cerebrovascular events. Prospective studies are needed to assess specifically whether the greater prevalence of hypoechoic plaques in PAD vs CAD patients is associated with a greater risk of cerebrovascular events.",

    "abstract": "Claudication secondary to peripheral arterial disease leads to reduced mobility, limited physical functioning, and poor health outcomes. Disease severity can be assessed with quantitative clinical methods and qualitative self-perceived measures of quality of life. Limited data exist to document the degree to which quantitative and qualitative measures correlate. The current study provides data on the relationship between quantitative and qualitative measures of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease.\nThis descriptive case series was set in an academic vascular surgery unit and biomechanics laboratory. The subjects were symptomatic patients with peripheral arterial disease patients presenting with claudication. The quantitative evaluation outcome measures included measurement of ankle-brachial index, initial claudication distance, absolute claudication distance, and self-selected treadmill pace. Qualitative measurements included the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey. Spearman rank correlations were performed to determine the relationship between each quantitative and qualitative measure and also between the WIQ and SF-36.\nIncluded were 48 patients (age, 62 +/- 9.6 years; weight, 83.0 +/- 15.4 kg) with claudication (ABI, 0.50 +/- 0.20). Of the four WIQ subscales, the ankle-brachial index correlated with distance (r = 0.29) and speed (r = 0.32); and initial claudication distance and absolute claudication distance correlated with pain (r = 0.40 and 0.43, respectively), distance (r = 0.35 and 0.41, respectively), and speed (r = 0.39 and 0.39 respectively). Of the eight SF-36 subscales, no correlation was found for the ankle-brachial index, initial claudication distance correlated with Bodily Pain (r = 0.46) and Social Functioning (r = 0.30), and absolute claudication time correlated with Physical Function (r = 0.31) and Energy (r = 0.30). The results of both questionnaires showed reduced functional status in claudicating patients.\nInitial and absolute claudication distances and WIQ pain, speed, and distance subscales are the measures that correlated the best with the ambulatory limitation of patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. These results suggest the WIQ is the most specific questionnaire for documenting the qualitative deficits of the patient with claudication while providing strong relationships with the quantitative measures of arterial disease. Future studies of claudication patients should include both quantitative and qualitative assessments to adequately assess disease severity and functional status in peripheral arterial disease patients.",

Qualitative measurements included the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey. Spearman rank correlations were performed to determine the relationship between each quantitative and qualitative measure and also between the WIQ and SF-36.",

Of the four WIQ subscales, the ankle-brachial index correlated with distance (r = 0.29) and speed (r = 0.32); and initial claudication distance and absolute claudication distance correlated with pain (r = 0.40 and 0.43, respectively), distance (r = 0.35 and 0.41, respectively), and speed (r = 0.39 and 0.39 respectively). Of the eight SF-36 subscales, no correlation was found for the ankle-brachial index, initial claudication distance correlated with Bodily Pain (r = 0.46) and Social Functioning (r = 0.30), and absolute claudication time correlated with Physical Function (r = 0.31) and Energy (r = 0.30). The results of both questionnaires showed reduced functional status in claudicating patients.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this population-based study was to determine the optimal dividing-line between normal aorta and aneurysm for different aortic segments in 70-year-old men and women by means of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging.\nTwo hundred thirty-one subjects (116 men), randomly recruited from a population-based cohort study, were included. The smallest outer diameter (dia) was measured on the axial survey scan on six predefined aortic segments: (1) ascending aorta, (2) descending aorta, (3) supraceliac aorta, (4) suprarenal aorta, (5) largest infrarenal abdominal aorta, and (6) aortic bifurcation. Relative aortic dia were calculated by dividing a given aortic dia by the suprarenal aortic dia. The dividing-line between normal aorta and aneurysm at different aortic segments was estimated by taking the mean dia +2 SD and/or mean ratio of the aortic segment to the suprarenal aorta +2 SD.\nThe mean dia of the six segments were 4.0 cm (SD 0.4), 3.2 cm (0.3), 3.0 cm (0.3), 2.8 cm (0.3), 2.4 cm (0.5), and 2.3 cm (0.3) in men. The corresponding dia in women were 3.4 cm (0.4), 2.8 cm (0.3), 2.7 cm (0.3), 2.7 cm (0.3), 2.2 cm (0.3), and 2.0 cm (0.2). The mean ratio to the suprarenal aorta was 1.4 (SD 0.2) for the ascending aorta, 1.2 (0.1) for the descending aorta, and 0.9 (0.2) for the infrarenal aorta in men. The corresponding ratios in women were 1.3 (0.2), 1.0 (0.1), and 0.8 (0.1).\nFor men the suggested dividing-line (dia and ratio) between normal aorta and aneurysm for the ascending aorta is 4.7 cm dia and 1.8 ratio, for the descending aorta 3.7 cm dia and 1.5 ratio, and for the infrarenal aorta is 3.0 cm dia and 1.1 ratio. The corresponding dividing-lines for women are 4.2 cm dia and 1.7 ratio, 3.3 cm dia and 1.3 ratio, and 2.7 cm dia and 1.0 ratio.",

DSA depicted 28 inflow stenoses in the remaining 21 patients (11 radiocephalic AVFs and 10 brachiocephalic AVFs). Clinical improvement was obtained in 18 out of 19 patients with a technically successful intervention (<30% residual stenosis after angioplasty or stent placement). Following endovascular therapy, access flow of 12 patients with a low flow access improved from 431 +/- 150 ml/min to 818 +/- 233 ml/min, and four patients with steal symptoms became symptom free. One nonmaturing fistula could be salvaged by angioplasty, and access cannulation problems were solved in another patient following angioplasty. Brachial artery stent placement did not reduce steal symptoms in one case, whereas two patients, in whom stent placement was not thought desirable, showed a >30% residual arterial stenosis after angioplasty. No complications were observed at DSA and endovascular intervention.\nRetrograde venous access puncture and catheterization, as an alternative to a potentially more hazardous brachial artery or more invasive femoral artery approach, should be considered for the visualization of the arterial inflow and endovascular treatment of inflow stenoses.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an age-related disease. In an aging population, the prevalence of AAA is likely to increase. Open AAA repair in patients aged >80 years is often not considered because of their advanced age as such or because of comorbidities. In addition, little is known about the natural history in such patients or survival after successful repair. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine peri-operative and late survival after AAA repair in octogenarians\nThe Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched to identify all studies reporting on octogenarians undergoing AAA repair published between January 1966 and June 2006. Two independent observers assessed the methodologic quality of the included studies and the data extraction. Outcomes were rates of perioperative mortality, complications, and long-term survival after open or endovascular repair (EVAR). Summary estimates with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random effects model.\nThirty-nine articles were included. The median aneurysm size was 6.7 cm in the conventional AAA repair group of 1534 patients. The perioperative mortality was 0% to 33%, with a pooled mortality of 7.5% (95% CI, 6.2% to 9.0%). The median 5-year survival rate for this group was 60% (range, 14% to 86%). In the 1045 patients treated with EVAR, the median aneurysm size was 5.9 cm. Their pooled perioperative mortality varied from 0% to 6%, with a pooled mortality of 4.6% (95% CI, 3.4 to 6.0%). We could not derive 5-year survival rates from articles describing endovascular repair of AAA.\nThe mortality rate after open or endovascular AAA repair in carefully selected octogenarians seems acceptable but is higher than the mortality rate in younger patients. Long-term survival rates were acceptable, but small sample size, selection, and publication bias must be taken into account. Finally, selection criteria for successful surgery with low mortality and morbidity rates cannot be derived from the literature.",

Transcriptional activity of long GT-repeat alleles in HO1 gene (HMOX1) is lower as compared with short alleles.

    "abstract": "Stent grafting has become the first-line approach to traumatic thoracic aortic transections (TTAT) in some trauma centers due to a perceived decrease in morbidity and mortality compared with standard open repair. We reviewed contemporary outcomes of patients undergoing endovascular repair of TTAT (endoTTAT) and those undergoing open repair (openTTAT) to determine if current reported results support first-line use of endoTTAT.\nRetrospective, nonrandomized studies published in English (>5 cases/report) involving TTAT listed in PubMed between 2001 and 2006 were systematically reviewed. Periprocedural outcomes between endoTTAT and openTTAT were analyzed. Mean follow-up was 22.9 months for endoTTAT (reported for 22 of 28 studies) and 48.6 months for openTTAT (reported for 5 of 12 studies). For statistical analysis, t tests were used.\nWe analyzed 33 articles reporting 699 procedures in which 370 patients treated with endoTTAT and 329 patients managed with openTTAT. No statistical differences were found between patient groups in mean age (41.3 vs 38.8 years, P < .10), injury severity score (39.8 vs 36.0, P < .10), or technical success rates of the procedure (96.5% vs 98.5%, P = .58). In contrast, mortality was significantly lower in the endoTTAT group (7.6% vs 15.2%, P = .0076) as were rates of paraplegia (0% vs 5.6%, P < .0001) and stroke (0.85% vs 5.3%, P = .0028). The most common procedure-related complications for each technique were iliac artery injury during endoTTAT and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury after openTTAT.\nTo our knowledge, no large multicenter prospective randomized trial comparing endoTTAT and openTTAT has been published in the literature. This meta-analysis of pooled data serves as a surrogate, demonstrating a significant reduction in mortality, paraplegia, and stroke rates in patients who undergo endoTTAT; however, the long-term durability of endoTTAT remains in question.",

    "abstract": "Regardless of the type of arterial reconstruction, luminal narrowing (stenosis or restenosis) develops in approximately one third of the vessels. In the past, the focus of research has been on the mechanisms of stenosis (intimal hyperplasia, pathologic remodeling) and pharmacologic approaches to prevention. An alternative approach is to induce intimal atrophy after luminal narrowing has developed, thus limiting treatment to only those patients that develop a problem. This approach to treat established disease by reducing wall mass through induction of cell death and extracellular matrix removal would be particularly useful for treating stenosis in synthetic bypass grafts or stented vessels, in which intimal hyperplasia is the primary mechanism of stenosis. This approach may be applicable as well to other vascular proliferative disorders, such as pulmonary hypertension and chronic transplant arteriopathy. Proof of principle has been shown in experiments with antibodies to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors that cause neointimal regression in baboon polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts and with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors that induce medial atrophy in hypertensive arteries. Possible molecular targets could include PDGF receptors, A20, and BMP4. Further studies are needed to determine the utility of such a therapeutic approach to vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal obesity and its associated metabolic consequences are major determinants for the development of vascular disease. Fat tissue close to arteries may also directly affect atherogenesis. The study examined whether intra-abdominal fat accumulation is an independent determinant of infrarenal aortic diameter in patients with clinically evident arterial disease. The relationship between metabolic syndrome and infrarenal aortic diameter was also assessed in this patient group.\nCross-sectional study was done of 2726 patients with clinically evident arterial disease enrolled in the Second Manifestations of ARTerial Disease (SMART) study. Intra-abdominal fat was measured with ultrasonography and by measuring waist circumference. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel III. The maximal anteroposterior diameter of the infrarenal aorta was measured using ultrasonography. The relation between intra-abdominal fat, metabolic syndrome, and infrarenal aortic diameter was determined with linear regression analyses and adjusted for age, sex, height, and smoking.\nInfrarenal aortic diameters (mm) increased across quartiles of intra-abdominal fat derived by ultrasonography (quartile 4, 19 +/- 7 mm vs quartile 1, 17 +/- 5 mm; adjusted beta, 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-1.94) and across quartiles of waist circumference (quartile 4, 19 +/- 7 mm vs quartile 1, 17 +/- 5 mm; adjusted beta, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.82-2.04). Patients with metabolic syndrome had slightly larger infrarenal aortic diameters (18 +/- 7 mm vs 17 +/- 6 mm; adjusted beta, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.27-1.13) compared with those without metabolic syndrome.\nIntra-abdominal fat accumulation and metabolic syndrome are associated with larger infrarenal aortic diameters in patients with clinically evident arterial disease. These data may indicate a role for intra-abdominal fat in the development of larger aortic diameters.",

This report examines the clinical results for the vascular surgery subgroup of patients enrolled in a larger double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial, which evaluated the comparative safety and efficacy of rThrombin and bovine plasma-derived thrombin (bThrombin) when used as adjuncts to surgical hemostasis.\nData from the 164 vascular patients who underwent either a peripheral arterial bypass (PAB) or arteriovenous graft (AV) procedure are included in this analysis. Time to hemostasis at proximal and distal anastomotic sites at 1.5-, 3-, 6-, and 10-minute intervals was determined by procedure (PAB or AV) and overall (PAB + AV). Baseline and day 29 immunologic sera were analyzed. The incidences of postoperative adverse events were compared between treatment groups. Categorical adverse events were evaluated in relation to thrombin product antibody formation.\nPatients were randomized to either bThrombin (n = 82) or rThrombin (n = 82). Procedures included PAB (n = 88) and AV (n = 76). The bThrombin and rThrombin groups were well matched for demographics and baseline characteristics. A comparable incidence of anastomotic hemostasis was observed in both treatment groups at 10 minutes (94% bThrombin, 91% rThrombin). The incidence of hemostasis was lower at all time points for PAB procedures compared with AV procedures. In the PAB group, a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving rThrombin (55%) achieved hemostasis at 3 minutes compared with bThrombin (39%; P < .05). Adverse event profiles and laboratory findings were similar between groups. No patients in the rThrombin group developed anti-rThrombin product antibodies at day 29, whereas 27% of patients in the bThrombin group developed antibodies to bThrombin product (P < .0001).\nrThrombin or bThrombin used as a hemostatic ancillary for anastomotic bleeding was equally effective at 10 minutes; however, rThrombin compared with bThrombin may provide a more rapid onset of hemostasis at 3 minutes in PAB procedures. Adverse events were similar between the two thrombins. In patients undergoing vascular surgery, both treatments were similarly well tolerated, although rThrombin demonstrated a superior immunogenicity profile.",

Of the seven renal artery aneurysms patients, four were hypertensive and three had rheumatoid arthritis. Both pancreaticoduodenal arcade artery aneurysms patients manifested severe stenosis of the celiac axis. Our transcatheter coil embolization procedure includes coil embolization and coil-packing of the aneurysmal sac, preserving the native arterial circulation.\nTranscatheter coil embolization with aneurysm packing was technically successful in 16 (72.7%) of the 22 patients and the native arterial circulation was preserved. Postprocedure angiograms confirmed complete disappearance of the VAA. In four of the nine splenic artery aneurysm patients, the native arterial circulation was not preserved. In one renal artery aneurysm patient, stenosis at the aneurysmal neck necessitated placement of a stent before transcatheter coil embolization. Magnetic resonance angiographs obtained during the follow-up period (mean 27 months) demonstrated complete thrombosis of the VAA in all 22 patients. Infarction occurred in one splenic- and two renal artery aneurysms patients; the latter developed flank pain and fever after the procedure.\nTranscatheter coil embolization is an effective alternative treatment for patients with saccular and proximal VAA.

    "abstract": "The remodeling of vein bypass grafts after arterialization is incompletely understood. We have previously shown that significant outward lumen remodeling occurs during the first month of implantation, but the magnitude of this response is highly variable. We sought to examine the hypothesis that systemic inflammation influences this early remodeling response.\nA prospective observational study was done of 75 patients undergoing lower extremity bypass using autogenous vein. Graft remodeling was assessed using a combination of ultrasound imaging and two-dimensional high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging.\nThe vein graft lumen diameter change from 0 to 1 month (22.7% median increase) was positively correlated with initial shear stress (P = .016), but this shear-dependent response was disrupted in subjects with an elevated baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level of >5 mg/L. Despite similar vein diameter and shear stress at implantation, grafts in the elevated hsCRP group demonstrated less positive remodeling from 0 to 1 month (13.5% vs 40.9%, P = .0072). By regression analysis, the natural logarithm of hsCRP was inversely correlated with 0- to 1-month lumen diameter change (P = .018). Statin therapy (beta = 23.1, P = .037), hsCRP (beta = -29.7, P = .006), and initial shear stress (beta = .85, P = .003) were independently correlated with early vein graft remodeling. In contrast, wall thickness at 1 month was not different between hsCRP risk groups. Grafts in the high hsCRP group tended to be stiffer at 1 month, as reflected by a higher calculated elastic modulus (E = 50.4 vs 25.1 Mdynes/cm2, P = .07).\nEarly positive remodeling of vein grafts is a shear-dependent response that is modulated by systemic inflammation. These data suggest that baseline inflammation influences vein graft healing, and therefore, inflammation may be a relevant therapeutic target to improve early vein graft adaptation.",

    "results": "The vein graft lumen diameter change from 0 to 1 month (22.7% median increase) was positively correlated with initial shear stress (P = .016), but this shear-dependent response was disrupted in subjects with an elevated baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level of >5 mg/L. Despite similar vein diameter and shear stress at implantation, grafts in the elevated hsCRP group demonstrated less positive remodeling from 0 to 1 month (13.5% vs 40.9%, P = .0072). By regression analysis, the natural logarithm of hsCRP was inversely correlated with 0- to 1-month lumen diameter change (P = .018). Statin therapy (beta = 23.1, P = .037), hsCRP (beta = -29.7, P = .006), and initial shear stress (beta = .85, P = .003) were independently correlated with early vein graft remodeling. In contrast, wall thickness at 1 month was not different between hsCRP risk groups. Grafts in the high hsCRP group tended to be stiffer at 1 month, as reflected by a higher calculated elastic modulus (E = 50.4 vs 25.1 Mdynes/cm2, P = .07).",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting is a relatively new intervention for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis, and the long-term outcomes and complications are therefore yet to be determined. In one surgeon's practice, it was found that a stent fracture was the etiological factor for recurrent stenosis. A retrospective study was therefore performed with the hypothesis that carotid stent fractures are common. The aims were to determine prevalence of fractures in this surgeon's series, risk factors, and most importantly, clinical relevance.\nPatients from one surgeon's private practice who had carotid stenosis deemed suitable for intervention (>80% asymptomatic, >70% symptomatic, 50% to 70% if an ulcerated lesion) and had suitable aortic and carotid morphology for carotid stenting between March 2004 and December 2006 were included. To enhance the quality of the measurement, two vascular surgeons and one radiologist examined the films independently to determine if there was a fracture present. Given that this was a retrospective study, there was no preconceived sample size determined.\nFracture prevalence was found to be 29.2% or 14 out of 48 stents. Restenosis occurred in 21% of those stents with a detected fracture, after an average follow-up of 15 months. Several anetiological factors are proposed, with a finding in this series, of a strong and significant association between the presence of calcified vessels and the presence of fractures (odds ratio 7.7; standard error 5.6; 95% confidence interval 1.9-32.0, P =.003).\nAlthough this is a small study, it demonstrates that carotid stent fractures do exist, and importantly, not all of them are benign. Therefore, the authors recommend regular surveillance with plain radiography in addition to duplex ultrasonography to enable early detection of fracturing. Following detection, institution of increased surveillance frequency and/or any appropriate intervention can be implemented, to aid in the prevention of complications resulting from restenosis should it become apparent.",

    "abstract": "Radiofrequency and laser vein treatment, which entail preservation of the saphenous confluence, have called into question the dogma of ligation of all tributaries at the sapheno-femoral confluence (SFC), so called \"crossectomy\". Nevertheless, crossectomy is still done when saphenous vein stripping is chosen for varicose vein treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate results after stripping procedures in which the SFC was preserved.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study for which limbs treated for varicose veins by surgical stripping of the great saphenous vein and preservation of the SFC were studied. All limbs had a preoperative duplex examination and showed SFC and truncal incompetence of the great saphenous vein. Periodic postoperative standing duplex ultrasound and clinical examinations were carried out, and results were recorded and analyzed retrospectively.\nA total of 195 lower limbs were operated on in 151 patients (128 women and 25 men) aged from 22 to 88 years (mean age 56.8). The preoperative diameter of the SFC ranged from 4.7 to 17 mm (mean 9.5 mm). The preoperative CEAP class distribution was C1 1.5%, C2 82.1%, C3 6.7%, and C4-C6 9.7%. Preoperative symptoms were present in 61.8% of cases. Postoperative thrombosis of the SFC was observed in one case with an extension to the deep femoral vein and pulmonary embolization at 1 month. Recovery was complete. At a mean of 24.4 months postoperatively (median 27.3 months, range 8 to 34.8), persistent SFC reflux was observed in only two cases (1.8%) and a SFC neovascularization in one case (0.9%). Recurrence of varicose veins appeared in seven cases (6.3%) but in conjunction with SFC reflux in only one case. Post treatment 83.9% of limbs were converted to CEAP clinical class 0 to 1 and significant symptom improvement was observed in 91.3% of cases with an aesthetic benefit in 95.5%.\nPreservation of the SFC during saphenous stripping gave good results with regard to hemodynamics and neovascularization on the SFC, varicose vein recurrence, improvement of symptoms, and aesthetic appearance for legs with a median follow-up of 27.3 months.",

    "abstract": "The American Vascular Association/Lifeline Foundation is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. This remarkable two-decade journey represents a cumulative effort by the leaders and members of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS). For the historical record, we would like to chart the sequence of events leading to various programs. In 1986, the Executive Council of SVS approved the formation of an Education/Research Foundation, from which the Lifeline Foundation evolved, with the mission to support the career development of young research-oriented vascular surgeons. Since that time, Lifeline has awarded 141 Student Fellowships, 21 Wylie Traveling Fellowships, 17 Mentored Clinical Scientist Development (K08) Awards, and three Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development (K23) Awards. In 2001, the American Vascular Association (AVA) was established under the aegis of American Association for Vascular Surgery (formerly International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery-North American Chapter). In 2004, with the merger of the SVS and the American Association of Vascular Surgery into a single entity (SVS), Lifeline and the AVA merged into a single foundation, the AVA. As AVA/Lifeline is poised to launch a campaign for an endowment fund, we hope this report will let the members of the SVS know what has been accomplished, what we plan to do, and, most importantly, what we need to do in the future.",

    "abstract": "Evidence regarding the influence of cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and patient characteristics on the growth of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is limited. We assessed, in an observational cohort study, rupture rates, risks of mortality, and the effects of cardiovascular risk factors and patient demographics on growth rates of small AAAs.\nBetween September 1996 and January 2005, 5057 patients with manifest arterial vascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors were included in the Second Manifestation of ARTerial disease (SMART) study. Measurements of the abdominal aortic diameter were performed in all patients. All patients with an initial AAA diameter between 30 and 55 mm were selected for this study. All AAA measurements during follow-up until August 2007 were collected. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to calculate the effects of demographic patient characteristics, initial AAA diameter, and cardiovascular risk factors on AAA growth.\nIncluded were 230 patients, with a mean age of 66 years and 90% were male. Seven AAA ruptures (six fatal) occurred in 755 patient years of follow-up (rupture rate 0.9% per patient-year). In 147 patients, AAA measurements were performed for a period of more than 6 months. The median follow-up time was 3.3 years (mean 4.0, range 0.5 to 11.1 years, standard deviation (SD) 2.5). Mean AAA diameter was 38.8 mm (SD 6.8) and mean expansion rate 2.5 mm/y. Patients using lipid-lowering drugs had a 1.2 mm/y (95% confidence interval [CI] -2.34 to -0.060 mm/y) lower AAA growth rate compared to nonusers of these drugs. Initial AAA diameter was associated with a 0.09 mm/y (95% CI 0.01 to 0.18 mm/y) higher growth rate per millimetre increase of the diameter. No other factors, including blood lipid values, were independently associated with AAA growth.\nLipid-lowering drug treatment and initial AAA diameter appear to be independently associated with lower AAA growth rates. The risk of rupture of these small abdominal aortic aneurysms was low, which pleads for watchful waiting.",

    "abstract": "We performed a device-specific comparison of long-term outcomes following endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) to determine the effect(s) of device type on early and late clinical outcomes. In addition, the impact of performing EVAR both within and outside of specific instructions for use (IFU) for each device was examined.\nBetween January 8, 1999 and December 31, 2005, 565 patients underwent EVAR utilizing one of three commercially available stent graft devices. Study outcomes included perioperative (< or =30 days) mortality, intraoperative technical complications and need for adjunctive procedures, aneurysm rupture, aneurysm-related mortality, conversion to open repair, reintervention, development and/or resolution of endoleak, device related adverse events (migration, thrombosis, or kinking), and a combined endpoint of any graft-related adverse event (GRAE). Study outcomes were correlated by aneurysm morphology that was within or outside of the recommended device IFU. chi2 and Kaplan Meier methods were used for analysis.\nGrafts implanted included 177 Cook Zenith (CZ, 31%), 111 Gore Excluder (GE, 20%), and 277 Medtronic AneuRx (MA, 49%); 39.3% of grafts were placed outside of at least one IFU parameter. Mean follow-up was 30 +/- 21 months and was shorter for CZ (20 months CZ vs 35 and 31 months for GE and MA, respectively; P < .001). Overall actuarial 5-year freedom from aneurysm-related death, reintervention, and GRAE was similar among devices. CZ had a lower number of graft migration events (0 CZ vs 1 GE and 9 MA); however, there was no difference between devices on actuarial analysis. Combined GRAE was lowest for CZ (29% CZ, 35% GE, and 43% MA; P = .01). Graft placement outside of IFU was associated with similar 5-year freedom from aneurysm-related death, migration, and reintervention (P > .05), but a lower freedom from GRAE (74% outside IFU vs 86% within IFU; P = .021), likely related to a higher incidence of graft thrombosis (2.3% outside IFU vs 0.3% within IFU; P = .026). The differences in outcome for grafts placed within vs outside IFU were not device-specific.\nEVAR performed with three commercially available devices provided similar clinically relevant outcomes at 5 years, although no graft migration occurred with a suprarenal fixation device. As anticipated, application outside of anatomically specific IFU variables had an incremental negative effect on late results, indicating that adherence to such IFU guidelines is appropriate clinical practice.",

Graft placement outside of IFU was associated with similar 5-year freedom from aneurysm-related death, migration, and reintervention (P > .05), but a lower freedom from GRAE (74% outside IFU vs 86% within IFU; P = .021), likely related to a higher incidence of graft thrombosis (2.3% outside IFU vs 0.3% within IFU; P = .026). The differences in outcome for grafts placed within vs outside IFU were not device-specific.",

    "abstract": "Intermittent claudication is the primary symptom of peripheral arterial disease, affecting between 1 and 3 million Americans. Symptomatic improvement can be achieved by endovascular revascularization, but such procedures are invasive, expensive, and may be associated with procedural adverse events. Medical treatment options, including claudication medications and supervised exercise training, are also known to be effective, albeit also with associated limitations. The CLEVER (Claudication: Exercise Vs. Endoluminal Revascularization) study, funded by the Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the relative efficacy, safety, and health economic impact of four treatment strategies for people with aortoiliac peripheral arterial disease and claudication. The treatment arms are: (1) optimal medical care (claudication pharmacotherapy); (2) primary stent placement; (3) supervised exercise rehabilitation; and (4) combined stenting with supervised exercise rehabilitation. The CLEVER study is a 5-year randomized, controlled clinical trial to be conducted at approximately 25 centers in the United States that will monitor 252 patients and their responses to treatment during an 18-month follow-up period. The primary end point is change in maximum walking duration on a graded treadmill test. Secondary end points include the change at 18 months in maximum walking duration from baseline, comparisons of free-living daily activity levels assessed by pedometer, health-related quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Other analyses include the effect of these treatment strategies on anthropomorphic and physiologic variables, including body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, pulse pressure, and resting pulse as well as biochemical markers of cardiovascular health, including fasting lipids, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and hemoglobin A 1c values.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the clinical outcome, morphologic changes, and behavior of acute and chronic type B aortic dissections after endovascular repair and evaluated the extent of dissection and diameter changes in the true (TL), false (FL), and whole lumen (WL) during follow-up.\nFrom May 2000 to September 2006, preprocedural and follow-up computed tomography scans were evaluated in 106 patients. Indices of the TL (TLi) and FL (FLi) were calculated at the proximal (p), middle (m), and distal (d) third of the descending thoracic aorta by dividing the TL or FL diameter by the WL. Analyses were by paired t test and chi2.\nStent grafts were used to treat 106 patients (mean age, 55 years, 70% men) with acute 59 (55.7%) and chronic 47 (44.3%) lesions. The entry site was successfully covered in 100 patients. The incidences of paraplegia and paresis were 2.8% and 1.0%. Mortality was 7.5% (8 patients), including two intraoperative deaths of contained ruptures. Seven (6.6%) early endoleaks occurred. At a mean follow-up of 15.6 months, TLi improved from 0.45 to 0.88 in the proximal third (p/3), from 0.42 to 0.81 in the middle third (m/3), and from 0.44 to 0.74 in the distal third (d/3), demonstrating expansion of the TL. Two patients had decrease in TL due to endoleak needing reintervention. The FLi decreased from 0.41 to 0.06 in p/3, from 0.44 to 0.10 in the m/3, and from 0.42 to 0.21 in the d/3, indicating FL shrinkage. Changes in the TLi and FLi were statistically significant. The decrease in the WL after repair was statistically significant in the proximal and middle aorta. Fourteen patients (13.2%) had increase in WL; seven required a second intervention. FL thrombosis occurred in 69 (65.1%). During follow-up, 36 (36.9%) patients had no retrograde flow, with complete shrinkage of the FL. The FL completely shrank in 28 patients (26.4%) despite retrograde flow. The FL increased in eight patients (7.5%); five needed reintervention. Thrombosis of FL was statistically significant with acute dissections and when dissection remained above the diaphragm (type IIIA; P = .001 and P = .0133).\nRemodeling changes were seen when the entry tear was covered. The fate of the FL was determined by persistent antegrade flow and the level of the retrograde flow. Endografting for thoracic type B dissection was successful and promoted positive aortic remodeling changes.",

The primary outcome variable was death <or=30 days of operation or before hospital discharge. We determined the effect of total hospital volume on operative mortality for all types of repair and for endovascular and open repair separately. All analyses were adjusted for patient risk using logistic regression.\nThe proportion of abdominal aortic aneurysms repaired with an endovascular approach increased from 27% to 39% during the 3-year study period.

Patients were assessed on PAD-specific measures consisting of ankle-brachial index (ABI), initial claudication distance, absolute claudication distance, physical function measures, health-related quality of life, and calf blood flow and transcutaneous oxygen tension responses after 3 minutes of vascular occlusion.\nInitial claudication distance (mean +/- SD) progressively declined (P = .019) in those with three (203 +/- 167 m), four (124 +/- 77 m), and five (78 +/- 57 m) metabolic syndrome components, and absolute claudication distance progressively declined (P = .036) in these groups as well (414 +/- 224 m vs 323 +/- 153 m vs 249 +/- 152 m, respectively). Furthermore, compared with patients with only three components of metabolic syndrome, those with all five components had impaired values (P < .05) for peak oxygen uptake, ischemic window, 6-minute walk distance, self-perceived walking ability and health, daily physical activity, health-related quality of life on six of eight domains, calf hyperemia, and calf ischemia after vascular occlusion. Abdominal obesity was the predictor (P < .05) of exercise performance during the treadmill and 6-minute walk tests, as well as physical activity. Elevated fasting glucose was the predictor (P < .05) of peripheral vascular measures, self-perceived walking ability and health, and health-related quality of life.\nPAD patients with more metabolic syndrome components have worsened intermittent claudication, physical function, health-related quality of life, and peripheral circulation. Abdominal obesity and elevated fasting glucose are the metabolic syndrome components that are most predictive of these outcome measures.

This study examined the long-term clinical outcome and incidence of restenosis after carotid endarterectomy using the new ACUSEAL (Gore-Tex) patching vs Hemashield Finesse (Boston Scientific Corp, Natick, Mass) patching.\nThe study randomized 200 patients (1:1) undergoing carotid endarterectomy to 100 with ACUSEAL patching and 100 with Hemashield-Finesse patching. All patients underwent immediate and 1-month postoperative duplex ultrasound studies, which were repeated at 6-month intervals. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the freedom from stroke, stroke-free survival, and the risk of restenosis for both groups.\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics, the mean operative diameter of the internal carotid artery, and the length of the arteriotomy were similar in both groups. The mean hemostasis time was 5.1 for the ACUSEAL patching vs 3.7 minutes for Finesse patching (P = .01); however, the mean operative times were similar for both groups (P = .61). The incidence of ipsilateral stroke was 2% for ACUSEAL patching (both early perioperative strokes) vs 3% for Finesse patching (2 early and 1 late stroke) at a mean follow-up of 21 months. The respective cumulative stroke-free rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 98%, 98%, and 98% for ACUSEAL patching vs 97%, 97%, and 97% for Finesse patching (P = .7). The respective cumulative stroke-free survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 97%, 92%, and 88% for ACUSEAL patching vs 96%, 96%, and 91% for Finesse patching (P = .6). The respective freedom from > or =70% carotid restenosis at 1, 2, and 3 years was 98%, 96%, and 89% for ACUSEAL patching vs 92%, 85%, and 79% for Finesse patching (P = .04).\nCarotid endarterectomy with ACUSEAL patching and Finesse patching had similar stroke-free rates and stroke-free survival rates. The mean hemostasis time for the ACUSEAL patch was 1.4 minutes longer than that for the Finesse patch; however, the Finesse patch had higher restenosis rates than the ACUSEAL patch.",

    "abstract": "Although mortality and complication rates for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) have declined over the last 20 years, operative complication rates and perioperative mortality are still high, specifically for repair of ruptures. The goal of this study was to determine the influence of insurance type and ethnicity while controlling for the influences of potential confounders on procedure selection and outcome following endovascular AAA repair (EVAR).\nUsing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, we identified patients who underwent EVAR repair of ruptured and elective infrarenal AAA, between 1990 and 2003. Insurance type and ethnicity were analyzed against the primary outcome variables of mortality and major complications. The potential confounders of age, gender, operative location, diabetes, and Deyo index of comorbidities, were controlled.\nBivariate analyses demonstrated significant differences between insurance types and ethnicity and mortality and complications. Patients who were self pay had adverse outcomes in comparison to Private insurance. Whites encountered less perioperative mortality and postoperative complications than Blacks and Hispanics.\nAfter controlling for previously identified associative factors for AAA outcome, ethnicity and insurance type does influence EVAR surgical outcome. Subsequent studies that break down emergent repair vs elective surgery and that longitudinally stratify delay in surgery, or time to admission may be useful.",

    "abstract": "Wounding patterns, methods of repair, and outcomes from femoropopliteal injury have been documented in recent civilian literature. In Operation Iraqi Freedom, as in past conflicts, these injuries continue to be a therapeutic challenge. Therefore, the objective of the current study is to document the pattern of femoropopliteal injuries, methods of repair, and early outcomes during the current military campaign in Iraq.\nFrom September 1, 2004, to April 30, 2007, all vascular injuries arriving at the Air Force Theater Hospital (the central echelon III medical facility in Iraq; equivalent to a civilian level I trauma center), Balad Air Base, Iraq were prospectively entered into a registry. From this, injuries involving the lower extremities were reviewed.\nDuring the 32-month study period, 9289 battle-related casualties were assessed. Of these, 488 (5.3%) were diagnosed with 513 vascular injuries, and 142 casualties sustained 145 injuries in the femoropopliteal domain. Femoral level injury was present in 100, and popliteal level injury occurred in 45. Injuries consisted of 59 isolated arterial, 11 isolated venous, and 75 combined. Fifty-eight casualties were evacuated from forward locations. Temporary arterial shunts were placed in 43, of which 40 (93%) were patent on arrival at our facility. Our group used shunts for early reperfusion before orthopedic fixation, during mass casualty care, or autogenous vein harvest in 11 cases. Arterial repair was accomplished with autogenous vein in 118 (88%), primary means in nine (7%), or ligation in seven (5%). Venous injury was repaired in 62 (72%). Associated fracture was present in 55 (38%), and nerve injury was noted in 19 (13%). Early limb loss due to femoropopliteal penetrating injury occurred in 10 (6.9%). Early mortality was 3.5% (n = 5).\nFemoropopliteal vascular injury remains a significant reality in modern warfare. Femoral injuries appear more prevalent than those in the popliteal region. Early results of in-theater repair are comparable with contemporary civilian reports and are improved from the Vietnam era. Rapid evacuation and damage control maneuvers such as temporary shunting and early fasciotomy assist timely definitive repair and appear effective.",

    "abstract": "The maximal strain, stress, elastic modulus, and stress-strain curve fitting of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) and bidirectional nonaneurysmal abdominal aorta (NAA) were measured and analyzed to obtain the ultimate mechanical properties, the more approximate stress-strain curve-fitting, and the elastic modulus formula of AAA and NAA.\nFourteen human AAA samples were harvested from patients undergoing elective aneurysm repair. Twelve NAA samples comprised of six longitudinal-circumferential pairs of NAA from six cadaveric organ donors were used as controls. Samples were mounted on a tensile-testing machine and force was applied until breakage occurred. The maximal strain, stress, and elastic modulus were calculated and a stress-strain curve was plotted for each sample. Exponential and second-order polynomial curves were used to fit the stress-strain curve, and the means were estimated by comparing the R2 (coefficient of determination that represents the strength of a curve fitting). Coefficients of elastic modulus were calculated and analyzed, and the incremental tendency of each modulus was evaluated by comparing the difference of coefficients.\nThere was no significant difference in maximal stress among AAA, circumferential aortic aneurysms (CAA), and longitudinal aortic aneurysms (LAA). However, AAA maximal strain was significantly less (P < .01) than that of bidirectional NAA. AAA maximal elastic modulus was significantly greater than that of CAA and LAA (P < .01 and .05, respectively). R2 of AAA for second-order polynomial curve was significantly greater (P < .05) than that for the exponential curve. For the elastic modulus formula from the second-order polynomial curve, E = 2ax + b, the average value of a for the AAA was significantly greater (P < .01) than that for the bidirectional NAA, but there was no significant difference (P > .05) among the three groups for the average value of b.\nTensile test measurements can successfully analyze ultimate mechanical properties of AAA and NAA. AAA is stiffer and less distensible than NAA under the same maximal stress. Second-order polynomial curve fitting provides a more approximate description for AAA stress-strain curve than exponential curve fitting does. Formula variables a of the elastic modulus formula from second-order polynomial curve fitting can determine the incremental tendency of the elastic modulus, while b has negligible effect on the incremental tendency of the elastic modulus.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) has become widely accepted in the elective setting but remains controversial for emergency repair of ruptured aneurysms (rAAA). We sought to examine the national trends in use and associated outcomes with EVAR.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to analyze all admissions for rAAA from 2001 through 2004. Nationwide temporal trends and demographics using weighted samples were evaluated. Focused univariate and multivariate analyses comparing outcomes from open repair and EVAR were done for the years 2003 and 2004.\nThere were 28,123 admissions for rAAA, with a stepwise decline in admissions from 2001 to 2004. Use of EVAR increased significantly from 6% of all emergency repairs in 2001 to 11% in 2004 (P < .01). Mortality for EVAR declined significantly from 43% to 29% (P < .01), but mortality with open repair showed no change (40% to 43%). From the 2003 to 2004 data set, 949 EVAR and 8982 open repairs were identified. Compared with open repair, the EVAR patients had lower mortality (31% vs 42%), shorter hospital stay (6 vs 9 days), and were more likely to be discharged to home (59% vs 37%, all P < .01). The total hospital charges for EVAR and open repair were similar (dollars 71,428 vs $74,520, P = .59). Mortality for EVAR was significantly higher at nonteaching hospitals compared with teaching centers (55% vs 21%, P < .01) and at nonteaching centers, even exceeding that of open repair (46%). Regression modeling confirmed the overall benefits of EVAR as well as the worse outcomes at nonteaching facilities after adjusting for patient comorbidities, disease severity, and hospital or system covariates.\nEndovascular repair is being increasingly used in the emergency management of ruptured AAA, with steadily decreasing mortality during the study period. Endovascular AAA repair is associated with improved mortality and outcomes compared with open repair, but results in nonteaching centers are substantially worse than those in teaching hospitals.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of congenital venous malformations poses a major clinical challenge. Great successes have been achieved with ethanol sclerotherapy in most lesions; however, severe complications are more likely to occur when more ethanol is used.\nThis study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a new sclerotherapy treatment that uses absolute alcohol and bleomycin A5. We evaluated our experience to present a safe treatment method for venous malformations.\nThe study population comprised 201 patients. Before treatment, lesions were categorized according to magnetic resonance imaging features: 120 patients had limited venous malformations, and 81 had infiltrating venous malformations. Percutaneous sclerotherapy was performed by direct injection of absolute alcohol and bleomycin A5 under fluoroscopy. The mean dose of the two medicines was 3.4 mL and 3.7 mg, respectively. We investigated 592 sclerotherapy sessions. A retrospective study was performed of medical records and color photographs and magnetic resonance imaging before and after treatment The mean follow-up was 29 months (range, 12-65 months).\nAfter embolization of the drainage vein with ethanol, a subsequent sclerosis therapy with bleomycin A5 was judged beneficial in 196 of 201 patients. Among the 196 responders, 56 showed disappearance of their chief symptoms, 42 showed improvement to nearly normal, and 62 showed marked improvement. The best response to our treatment was among the patients with limited venous malformations, with 114 (95%) showing at least marked improvement. Complications were tissue necrosis in 6 sessions, peripheral nerve palsy in 5, pigmentation in 10, blistering in 5, and 87 sessions resulted in transient side effects related to bleomycin A5, such as fever and gastrointestinal irritation. All were self-limited. No major complications such as cardiopulmonary collapse or pulmonary fibrosis were observed.\nPercutaneous sclerotherapy of venous malformations using absolute ethanol and bleomycin A5 is safe and effective.

The best response to our treatment was among the patients with limited venous malformations, with 114 (95%) showing at least marked improvement. Complications were tissue necrosis in 6 sessions, peripheral nerve palsy in 5, pigmentation in 10, blistering in 5, and 87 sessions resulted in transient side effects related to bleomycin A5, such as fever and gastrointestinal irritation. All were self-limited. No major complications such as cardiopulmonary collapse or pulmonary fibrosis were observed.",

    "abstract": "Suprarenal clamping in abdominal aortic surgery is associated with a significant risk of postoperative renal failure, general morbidity, and mortality. Arterial access for temporary shunting in these patients is difficult, and arterial perfusion techniques are typically complex. This study evaluated if renal perfusion with venous blood using a minimal pump setup and intermediate-level heparinization prevents a decline in postoperative renal function in patients requiring suprarenal clamping for aortic reconstructive surgery.\nRenal perfusion was achieved using a roller pump supplied with venous blood from a central venous catheter under medium-level heparinization to feed two perfusion balloon catheters. The calculated glomerular filtration rate was observed for 10 postoperative days and compared with the rate in patients with suprarenal clamping without renal perfusion.\nFrom 2001 to 2007, 158 patients underwent surgical reconstruction involving the pararenal aorta through a midline abdominal incision. Renal perfusion was started in 2006 and was always attempted if suprarenal clamping was anticipated preoperatively. Twenty-six patients received renal perfusion, and 132 also requiring suprarenal clamping did not. Of the latter, 109 were included in the control group. Five patients died <or=30 days (3.7%), one in the perfusion group. On average, there was a postoperative loss of renal performance in both groups. Dialysis was required postoperatively in 13 patients without renal perfusion, 4 of them long term (3.7%), but not in patients with renal perfusion. The reduction in glomerular filtration rate at 10 days in the nonperfused group was significantly higher than in the perfused group (7.24 vs 0.89 mL/min) despite a significantly longer suprarenal clamp time in the latter (25.5 vs 45.5 minutes). Multivariate analysis showed a significant reduction in the loss of glomerular filtration rate with perfusion (P = .007) if clamp time and preoperative renal function were taken into account. Patients with preoperative renal impairment showed the greatest benefit from the perfusion.\nThe setup for renal perfusion with venous blood during suprarenal clamping was simple and safe. Perfusion significantly reduced the reduction of renal function in the immediate postoperative period, suggesting that clamp time may thus be safely be extended to allow for complex reconstruction of the pararenal aortic segment. The benefit was most marked for patients with preoperative renal impairment.",

    "abstract": "Descending thoracic and abdominal aortic coarctations are characterized by a segmental narrowing that frequently involves the origin of the visceral and renal arteries. Optimal primary treatment is debated, being reported for both surgical and percutaneous complications. We describe our surgical experience with two youths presenting with failure of distal descending aortic stenting and with abdominal aortic coarctation post-balloon angioplasty, and associated thrombosis of a stented right renal artery and stenosis of the origin of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). In both cases, a longitudinal aortoplasty was performed with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patch, using simple aortic cross-clamping. Renal thrombosis and SMA stenosis were managed with eversion technique. In-hospital course was uneventful. Midterm follow-up showed absence of significant restenosis and better control of hypertension. In order to refrain from operating on these patients as long as possible, and also because of the very high risk of a redo-surgery, we think that an initial balloon angioplasty should be considered. Surgical management can be adopted, even after failure of percutaneous treatments, with satisfactory short- and midterm vessels patency.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that graft porosity hampers aneurysm shrinkage in patients who have been treated with the original Excluder device. To our knowledge, this suspected porosity has never been visualized in such patients. We present three patients treated with the original Excluder device whose aneurysms did not shrink in the first 2 years after treatment. Computed tomography (CT) angiography and late phase CT did not show endoleak. We performed late phase magnetic resonance imaging with a blood pool agent to visualize graft porosity. Our cases illustrate the usability of a new contrast agent and a new imaging strategy for visualizing slow-flow endoleaks that can not be imaged using currently used imaging techniques with conventional contrast agents.",

    "abstract": "Follow-up mortality is high in patients with type B aortic dissection (TB-AD) approaching one in four patients at 3 years. A predictor of increased mortality is partial thrombosis of the false lumen which may occlude distal tears. The hemodynamic consequences of differing tear size, location, and patency within the false lumen is largely unknown. We examined the impact of intimal tear size, tear number, and location on false lumen pressure.\nIn an ex-vivo model of chronic type B aortic dissection connected to a pulsatile pump, simultaneous pressures were measured within the true and false lumen. Experiments were performed in different dissection models with tear sizes of 6.4 mm and 3.2 mm in the following configurations; model A: proximal and distal tear simulating the most common hemodynamic state in patients with TB-AD; model B: proximal tear only simulating patients with partial thrombosis and occlusion of distal tear; and model C: distal tear only simulating patients sealed proximally via a stent graft with persistent distal communication. To compare false lumen diastolic pressure between models, a false lumen pressure index (FPI%) was calculated for all simulations as FPI% = (false lumen diastolic pressure/true lumen diastolic pressure) x 100.\nIn model A, the systolic pressure was slightly lower in the false lumen compared with the true lumen while the diastolic pressure (DP) was slightly higher in the false lumen (DP 66.45 +/- 0.16 mm Hg vs 66.20 +/- 0.12 mm Hg, P < .001, FPI% = 100.4%). In the absence of a distal tear (model B), diastolic pressure was elevated within the false lumen compared with the true lumen (58.95 +/- 0.10 vs 54.66 +/- 0.17, P < .001, FPI% = 107.9%). The absence of a proximal tear in the presence of a distal tear (model C) diastolic pressure was also elevated within the false lumen versus the true lumen (58.72 +/- 0.24 vs 56.15 +/- 0.16, P < .001, FPI% 104.6%). The difference in diastolic pressure was greatest with a smaller tear (3.2 mm) in model B. In model B, DBP increased by 13.9% (P < .001, R(2) 0.69) per 10 beat per minute increase in heart rate (P < .001) independent of systolic pressure.\nIn this model of chronic type B aortic dissection, diastolic false lumen pressure was the highest in the setting of smaller proximal tear size and the lack of a distal tear. These determinants of inflow and outflow may impact false lumen expansion and rupture during the follow-up period.",

    "abstract": "This study prospectively assessed the diagnostic accuracy of a novel bilateral photoplethysmography toe pulse measurement technique for the detection of significant lower limb peripheral arterial disease.\nBilateral photoplethysmography toe pulse measurements were compared with the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) gold standard reference.

These characteristics were compared with previously obtained normative ranges, and the accuracy was assessed for all significant disease (ABPI <0.9) and higher-grade disease (ABPI <0.5). Measurements were collected in a controlled environment within a tertiary vascular surgical unit for 111 subjects (age range, 42-91 years), of whom 48 had significant lower limb peripheral arterial disease and 63 were healthy. Subjects were matched in age, sex, height, body mass index, and heart rate. Diagnostic performance was assessed using diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, negative-predictive and positive-predictive value, and the kappa statistic representing agreement between techniques beyond chance.\nThe degree that pulse shape fell beyond the normal range of normalized pulse shapes was at the threshold of substantial to almost perfect agreement compared with ABPI for significant disease detection (diagnostic accuracy, 91% [kappa = 0.80]; sensitivity, 93%; specificity, 89%), and with 90% accuracy (kappa = 0.65) for higher-grade disease detection. Pulse transit time differences between right and left toes also had substantial agreement with ABPI, with diagnostic accuracy of 86% for significant disease detection (pulse transit time to pulse foot [kappa = 0.71] and to pulse peak [kappa = 0.70]) and reached at least 90% for these for the higher-grade disease. The performance ranking for the different pulse features mirrored an earlier pilot study. With the shape and pulse transit time measurements, the negative-predictive values of the 5% disease population screening-prevalence level were at least 99% and had positive-predictive values of at least 98% for the 90% disease-prevalence level for vascular laboratory referrals.\nThis simple-to-use technique could offer significant benefits for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease in settings such as primary care where noninvasive, accurate, and diagnostic techniques not requiring specialist training are desirable.

    "abstract": "Evidence suggesting a beneficial effect of cardioprotective medications in patients with lower extremity atherosclerosis derives largely from secondary prevention studies of heterogeneous populations. Patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) have a large atherosclerotic burden with related high mortality. The effect of such therapies in this population is largely inferred and unproven.\nThe Project of Ex-Vivo vein graft Engineering via Transfection III (PREVENT III) cohort comprised 1404 patients with CLI who underwent lower extremity bypass grafting in a multicenter, randomized prospective trial testing the efficacy of edifoligide for the prevention of graft failure. Propensity scores were used to evaluate the influence of statins, beta-blockers, and antiplatelet agents on outcomes while adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, medications, and surgical variables that may influence drug use. Primary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events < or =30 days, vein graft patency, and 1-year survival assessed by Kaplan-Meier method. Potential determinants of 1-year survival were modeled using a multivariate Cox regression.\nIn this cohort, 636 patients (45%) were taking statins, 835 (59%) were taking beta-blockers, and 1121 (80%) were taking antiplatelet drugs. Perioperative major adverse cardiovascular events (7.8%) and early mortality (2.7%) were not measurably affected by the use of any drug class. Statin use was associated with a significant survival advantage at 1 year of 86% vs 81% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.98; P = .03) by analysis of both unweighted and propensity score-weighted data. Use of beta-blockers and antiplatelet drugs had no appreciable impact on survival. None of the drug classes were associated with graft patency measures at 1 year. Significant predictors of 1-year mortality by Cox regression modeling were statin use (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51-0.90; P = .001), age >75 (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.60-2.82; P = .001), coronary artery disease (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.15-2.01; P = .001), chronic kidney disease stages 4 (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.17-3.55; P = .001) and 5 (HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.39-4.73; P < .001), and tissue loss (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.23-2.80; P = .003).\nStatin use is associated with improved survival in CLI patients 1 year after surgical revascularization. Further studies are indicated to determine optimal dosing in this population and to definitively address the question of relationship to graft patency. These data add to the growing literature supporting statin use in patients with advanced peripheral arterial disease.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the short- and midterm results following endovascular repair of a traumatic rupture of the aortic isthmus.\nBetween January 2001 and January 2007, 27 patients underwent endovascular repair for acute traumatic rupture of the aortic isthmus (8 women, 19 men, mean age 40.2 +/- 16.7 years [19-78]). All patients underwent a computed tomography scan resulting in the preoperative diagnosis of aortic disruptions. Twenty-one patients were treated within the first 5 days following diagnosis. Follow-up computed tomography scans were performed at 1 week, at 3 and 6 months, and annually thereafter. The median follow-up was 40 months.\nAll endografts were successfully deployed (Excluder-TAG [16], Talent [10], Zenith [2]). Three patients required common iliac artery access. The morbidity rate was 14.8%: two cases of inadvertent coverage of supra-aortic trunks occurred peroperatively, a proximal type I endoleak was successfully treated by a proximal implantation of a second endograft, and one collapse of an endograft was successfully treated by open repair and explantation. No patient suffered transient or permanent paraplegia, cerebral complication, endograft migration, or secondary endoleak. The overall mortality rate was 3.7%.\nShort and midterm results following endovascular treatment for traumatic rupture of the aortic isthmus favor the proposition of endovascular repair as the first-line treatment in hemodynamically unstable patients. In hemodynamically stable patients, the preoperative morphological evaluations aim to assess aortic anatomy and thereby detect possible technical limitations (aortic diameter <20 mm, severe aortic isthmus angulation, short proximal aortic neck <20 mm, conical aorta). In the presence of any one of these technical restrictions, open surgical treatment should be discussed to avoid major per- or postoperative complications related to endovascular repair. Further studies and long-term survival studies are mandatory to determine the efficacy and durability of this technique.",

    "abstract": "We report our 6-year experience with the visceral hybrid procedure for high-risk patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) and chronic expanding aortic dissections (CEAD).\nHybrid procedure includes debranching of the visceral and renal arteries followed by endovascular exclusion of the aneurysm. A series of 28 patients (20 male, mean age 66 years) were treated between January 2001 and July 2007. Sixteen patients had TAAAs type I-III, one type IV, four thoracoabdominal placque ruptures, and seven patients CEAD. Patients were treated for asymptomatic, symptomatic, and ruptured aortic pathologies in 20, and 4 patients, respectively. Two patients had Marfan's syndrome; 61% had previous infrarenal aortic surgery. The infrarenal aorta was the distal landing zone in 70%. In elective cases, simultaneous approach (n = 9, group I) and staged approach (n = 11, group II) were performed. Mean follow-up is 22 months (range 0.1-78).\nPrimary technical success was achieved in 89%. All stent grafts were implanted in the entire thoracoabdominal aorta. Additionally, three patients had previous complete arch vessel revascularization. Left subclavian artery was intentionally covered in three patients (11%). Thirty-day mortality rate was 14.3% (4/28). One patient had a rupture before the staged endovascular procedure and died. Overall survival rate at 3 years was 70%, in group I 80%, and in group II 60% (P = .234). Type I endoleak rate was 8%. Permanent paraplegia rate was 11%. Three patients required long-term dialysis (11%). Peripheral graft occlusion rate was 11% at 30 days. Gut infarction with consecutive bowel resection occurred in two patients. There was no significant difference between group I and II regarding paraplegia and complications.\nEarly results of visceral hybrid repair for high-risk patients with complex and extended TAAAs and CEADs are encouraging in a selected group of high risk patients in whom open repair is hazardous and branched endografts are not yet optional.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular management of both acute and chronic thoracic aortic pathology has emerged as an alternative to open surgery. We reviewed our single center experience with endovascular devices for the treatment of thoracic aortic pathology.\nBetween April 2000 and October 2007, 116 thoracic aortic stent grafts were placed to treat a variety of acute or chronic thoracic aortic lesions. Thirty-five percent of the cases were performed emergently. Sixty-five percent of the patients were male; the average age was 63.9 years (range 20-93 years). Indications for treatment were chronic degenerative aneurysms (n = 70), traumatic aortic disruption (n = 20), complicated dissection, intramural hematoma, or penetrating aortic ulcer (n = 14), pseudoaneurysm (n = 10), and Diverticulum of Kommerell (n = 2). Arch vessel revascularization (n = 32) or mesenteric debranching (n = 7) was performed in select cases. Devices used were industry-approved thoracic aortic devices (n = 80), aortic cuff extenders (n = 19), or custom made by the surgeon (n = 17).\nThe 30-day death, stroke and paraplegia/paresis rates were 5.2%, 8.6%, and 2.6%, respectively. Arterial access complications requiring immediate operative repair occurred at a rate of 11.2% (n = 13). The endoleak rate requiring repeat intervention was 6.9% (n = 8). The delayed graft infection rate was 5.2% (n = 6), with four of these cases resulting in death. The mean follow-up is 15 months (range 1-78 months). Computed tomography angiograms were performed at 1, 6, and 12 months following the index procedure, and yearly thereafter.\nEndovascular therapy for acute and chronic thoracic aortic pathology is a viable alternative to open surgery with comparable operative morbidity and mortality. Midterm results suggest that endografts are durable, but require more secondary interventions and imaging surveillance than open reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Iliac artery aneurysms are rare but associated with significant morbidity and mortality when ruptured. This study compares recent open and endovascular repairs of iliac aneurysms at a single institution.\nPatients were identified and charts reviewed using ICD-9 and CPT codes for iliac artery aneurysm and open or endovascular repair performed between January 2000 and January 2006. Baseline characteristics, procedure-related variables, and follow-up data were retrospectively reviewed.\nA total of 71 patients were treated with isolated iliac artery aneurysms. There were 19 open and 52 endovascular repairs. Seven presented with acute ruptures and were treated by open (4) or endovascular (3) repair. Preoperative comorbidities were similar between the two groups. Major perioperative (30 day) complications included three deaths in the open group from cardiovascular complications, all after ruptured aneurysm repair, and one death in the endovascular group (after rupture; one additional perioperative death occurred after 30 days due to colonic infarction) (P = NS). Postoperative complications were less frequent in the endovascular group, although this did not reach statistical significance. The mortality was 50% in the open group and 33% in the endovascular group for patients presenting with a ruptured aneurysm (P = NS). Transfusion requirement was significantly higher in the open group (47%) than in the endovascular group (6%) (P = .03). The mean follow-up was 20 +/- 5 months in the open group and 17 +/- 2 months in the endovascular group (P = NS). Long-term complications included two limb thromboses following repair with a bifurcated stent graft that were treated with thrombolysis plus stenting or a fem-fem bypass. Three endoleaks were identified on postop CT scans, all of which were successfully managed with endovascular techniques. There were no postoperative ruptures or aneurysm-related death. The mean postoperative length of stay was 5.2 +/- 2.3 days (open) and 1.3 +/- 1.0 days (endovascular) (P = .04).\nThis is the first large, case control study comparing open vs endovascular repair of isolated iliac artery aneurysms. Endovascular repair of iliac artery aneurysms is safe and results in decreased length of stay, lower requirement for perioperative blood transfusion, and similar intermediate term outcomes as open repair.",

Calcification and intraluminal thrombus can be commonly found in AAAs, but the relationship between calcification/intraluminal thrombus and AAA wall stress is not completely described.\nPatient-specific three-dimensional AAA geometries were reconstructed from computed tomographic images of 20 patients. Structural analysis was performed to calculate the wall stresses of the 20 AAA models and their altered models when calcification or intraluminal thrombus was not considered. A nonlinear large-strain finite element method was used to compute the wall stress distribution. The relationships between wall stresses and volumes of calcification and intraluminal thrombus were sought.\nMaximum stress was not correlated with the percentage of calcification, and was negatively correlated with the percentage of intraluminal thrombus (r = -0.56; P = .011). Exclusion of calcification from analysis led to a significant decrease in maximum stress by a median of 14% (range, 2%-27%; P < .01). When intraluminal thrombus was eliminated, maximum stress increased significantly by a median of 24% (range, 5%-43%; P < .01).\nThe presence of calcification increases AAA peak wall stress, suggesting that calcification decrease the biomechanical stability of AAA. In contrast, intraluminal thrombus reduces the maximum stress in AAA. Calcification and intraluminal thrombus should both be considered in the evaluation of wall stress for risk assessment of AAA rupture.",

All analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle.\nThe primary end point occurred in 11 patients (13.1%) in the treatment group compared with 17 (20.0%) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-1.28; P = .19). Mean follow-up was 3.2 years and 2.9 years, respectively. Five additional patients in the control group required compression therapy owing to post-thrombotic signs and symptoms not included in the primary end point. No venous ulceration was observed in either group. Within subgroup analyses of the primary end point, we observed a large sex-specific difference between women (HR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.02-0.91) and men (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.42-2.73). Symptom relief was significant in favor of compression treatment during the first year but not thereafter.\nProlonged compression therapy after proximal deep vein thrombosis significantly reduces symptoms and may prevent post-thrombotic skin changes. Whether these findings translate to the prevention of advanced disease states with ulcerations remains unclear.",

    "abstract": "To validate the use of a novel mathematical algorithm applied to digital imaging and communication in medicine (DICOM) computed tomography (CT) data to automate the generation of complex endovascular graft planning.\nAn algorithm was developed enabling the creation of patient-specific mathematical model based upon DICOM CT data to allow for detailed efficient geometric analysis with repeatable results. This algorithm was applied to high resolution DICOM CT datasets of 15 patients, selected at random from 350 patients with aneurysms involving the visceral arteries. The longitudinal and rotational relationships of the visceral vessels were determined by the algorithm. For comparison purposes, the same measurements were acquired manually using centerline of flow software by a blinded investigator. The distance between the renal arteries, and location of the renal origins calculated with each method were then compared.\nAutomated results were readily created for all 15 randomly selected patients. The measured versus calculated mean inter-renal artery distances were exceptionally close, differing by a mean of only 1.3 mm with a maximal range of 3.0 mm. The rotational position of the renal origins differed by only 10.5 degrees of arc (21 clock-face minutes) on average and by 32.5 degrees in the worst case.\nThe generation of an automated mathematical model to represent complex aortic geometry is feasible and reproducible in the context of high-resolution CT data. This process has been validated in 15 patients, where results corresponded with manual measurements that were used to successfully implant customized devices that accommodate the imaged vessels. Additional attributes include the expression of the 3D aorta in a compact form (on the order of kilobytes) for purposes of data storage, transfer, and other manipulations.\nThe construct of mathematical representation of patient specific anatomy from CT data is both feasible and applicable, allowing for automated endograft device design even in the setting of markedly tortuous anatomy where the repair must incorporate major aortic branches. The process has been validated in 15 patients, where results corresponded with manual measurements that were used to successfully implant customized devices that accommodate the imaged vessels. The application of this technology must now be studied in a prospective manner and incorporated into a system users may readily apply to patients undergoing evaluation. Additional attributes of a mathematical representation of the arterial tree include the 3D expression from a very compact set of parameters (on the order of kilobytes) for purposes of data storage, transfer, and other manipulations.",

    "abstract": "The pattern and distribution of arterial occlusions and stenoses in patients with critical limb ischemia presenting at two academic medical centers was described.\nFrom January 1998 to December 2006, 450 consecutive critical limb ischemia patients who underwent arteriography and infrainguinal revascularization at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center or Southern Illinois University were retrospectively evaluated. Demographics, clinical morbidities, and Fontaine stage were recorded. The arterial tree was categorized into three groups: the aorta and iliac arteries (A-I); the common femoral, superficial femoral, and profunda femoral arteries (Fem); and the popliteal and tibial arteries (Pop-Tib). Arterial segments within groups were categorized as subcritical stenoses (patent or <50% stenoses), critical stenoses (single or multiple >50% stenoses), or occluded (segmental occlusions of any length). Patients with diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, and Fontaine stage (III vs IV) were analyzed for differing disease patterns according to their chart history.\nOcclusive disease was present in 5% in all arterial segments (A-I + Fem + Pop-Tib), in 1% in the A-I + Fem group, in 2% in the A-I + Pop-Tib group, in 3% in A-I group, in 4% in the Fem group, in 30% in the Fem + Pop-Tib group, and in 55% in the Pop-Tib group. Descriptive comparisons among subgroups demonstrated a 61% to 69% prevalence of popliteal and tibial occlusive patterns in patients with diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, and Fontaine stage IV. Furthermore, 65% of patients with Pop-Tib occlusions had associated critical stenoses in the proximal arterial groups.\nMore than half of critical limb ischemia patients undergoing infrainguinal revascularization have arterial occlusions in the popliteal or tibial arterial segments, or both, with associated critical stenoses in the femoral arterial segments, which is even greater in the subgroups with diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, and Fontaine stage IV. Knowledge of such occlusive patterns is important for the development of novel infrainguinal endovascular and angiogenesis therapies for critical limb ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Though the peroneal artery (PA) often remains patent despite disease or occlusion of other infrapopliteal arteries, there is skepticism about using the terminal PA as the outflow tract in distal revascularizations for limb salvage, especially when a patent inframalleolar artery is available. We analyzed our experience of using the distal PA and inframalleolar or pedal branches arteries as outflow tracts in revascularizations for critical limb ischemia.\nOver a decade, among 651 infrapopliteal arterial reconstructions performed in 597 patients, the PA was the outflow vessel in 214, its distal third being involved in 69 vein revascularizations (study group). During the same period, 187 vein bypass grafts were performed to 179 inframalleolar and 8 pedal branches arteries (control group). Patency, limb salvage and survival rates were assessed using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis. Complete follow-up (range, 0.1-10.2 years; mean, 5.8 years) was obtained in 245 (95.7%) patients (66 were in the study group).\nThe distal PA was chosen as the target vessel: (1) because the proximal, mid-PA was occluded or severely diseased and no other adequate inframalleolar or pedal branches arteries were identified preoperatively (n = 30; 43.5%); (2) because an alternative inframalleolar target vessel was present but severely diseased (n = 9; 13%); (3) because of the length limitations of the available vein (n = 12; 17.4%; or (4) because of the presence of invasive infection or necrosis overlying the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial arteries (n = 18; 26.1%). The study group was significantly younger than the control group (68 +/- 7 years vs 70 +/- 6 years, P = .039), and included significantly more patients with diabetes mellitus (65.2% vs 50.2%, P = .033) and insulin dependence (52.2% vs 37.9%, P = .041), dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (5.8% vs 1.1%, P = .047), and history of smoking (75.3% vs 58.2%, P = .012). None of the patients died in the perioperative period. Although the overall need for minor amputation was statistically higher in the PA group (78.2% vs 63.1%, P = .022), especially as concerns partial calcanectomy (8.7% vs 2.1%, P = .026), the proportion of wounds completely healed during the follow-up and the mean time to wound healing were comparable in the two groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed comparable long-term patency, limb salvage, and survival rates in the two groups.\nRevascularization to the distal third of the PA can achieve much the same outcome in terms of patency and limb salvage rates, wound healing rate and timing, as when other inframalleolar or pedal branches are used. The skepticism surrounding use of the terminal PA as an outflow vessel appears to be unwarranted.",

    "abstract": "Simulator-based endovascular skills training measurably improves performance in catheter-based image-guided interventions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether structured global performance assessment during endovascular simulation correlated well with trainee-reported procedural skill and prior experience level.\nFourth-year and fifth-year general surgery residents interviewing for vascular fellowship training provided detailed information regarding prior open vascular and endovascular operative experience. The pretest questionnaire responses were used to separate subjects into low (<20 cases) and moderate (20 to 100) endovascular experience groups. Subjects were then asked to perform a renal angioplasty/stent procedure on the Procedicus Vascular Intervention System Trainer (VIST) endovascular simulator (Mentice Corporation, Gothenburg, Sweden). The subjects' performance was supervised and evaluated by a blinded expert interventionalist using a structured global assessment scale based on angiography setup, target vessel catheterization, and the interventional procedure. Objective measures determined by the simulator were also collected for each subject. A postsimulation questionnaire was administered to determine the subjects' self-assessment of their performance.\nSeventeen surgical residents from 15 training programs completed questionnaires before and after the exercise and performed a renal angioplasty/stent procedure on the endovascular simulator. The beginner group (n = 8) reported prior experience of a median of eight endovascular cases (interquartile range [IQR], 6.5-17.8; range, 4-20), and intermediate group (n = 9) had previously completed a median of 42 cases (IQR, 31-44; range, 25-89, P = .01). The two groups had similar prior open vascular experience (79 cases vs 75, P = .60). The mean score on the structured global assessment scale for the low experience group was 2.68 of 5.0 possible compared with 3.60 for the intermediate group (P = .03). Scores for subcategories of the global assessment score for target vessel catheterization (P = .02) and the interventional procedure (P = .05) contributed more to the differentiation between the two experience groups. Total procedure time, fluoroscopy time, average contrast used, percentage of lesion covered by the stent, placement accuracy, residual stenosis rates, and number of cine loops utilized were similar between the two groups (P > .05).\nStructured endovascular skills assessment correlates well with prior procedural experience within a high-fidelity simulation environment. In addition to improving endovascular training, simulators may prove useful in determining procedural competency and credentialing standards for endovascular surgeons.",

    "abstract": "A recent randomized trial suggested nitinol self-expanding stents (SES) were associated with reduced restenosis rates compared with simple percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). We evaluated our results with superficial femoral artery (SFA) SES to determine whether TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus (TASC) classification, indication for intervention, patient risk factors, or Society of Vascular Surgery (SVS) runoff score correlated with patency and clinical outcome, and to evaluate if bare nitinol stents or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) covered stent placement adversely impacts the tibial artery runoff.\nA total of 109 consecutive SFA stenting procedures (95 patients) at two university-affiliated hospitals from 2003 to 2006 were identified. Medical records, angiographic, and noninvasive studies were reviewed in detail. Patient demographics and risk factors were recorded. Procedural angiograms were classified according to TASC Criteria (I-2000 and II-2007 versions) and SVS runoff scores were determined in every patient; primary, primary-assisted, secondary patency, and limb salvage rates were calculated. Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine if indication, TASC classification, runoff score, and comorbidities affected outcome.\nSeventy-one patients (65%) underwent SES for claudication and 38 patients (35%) for critical limb ischemia (CLI). Average treatment length was 15.7 cm, average runoff score was 4.6. Overall 36-month primary, primary-assisted, and secondary rates were 52%, 64%, and 59%, respectively. Limb salvage was 75% in CLI patients. No limbs were lost following interventions in claudicants (mean follow-up 16 months). In 24 patients with stent occlusion, 15 underwent endovascular revision, only five (33%) ultimately remained patent (15.8 months after reintervention). In contrast, all nine reinterventions for in-stent stenosis remained patent (17.8 months). Of 24 patients who underwent 37 endovascular revisions for either occlusion or stenosis, eight (35%) had worsening of their runoff score (4.1 to 6.4). By Cox proportional hazards analysis, hypertension (hazard ratio [HR] 0.35), TASC D lesions (HR 5.5), and runoff score > 5 (HR 2.6) significantly affected primary patency.\nSelf-expanding stents produce acceptable outcomes for treatment of SFA disease. Poorer patency rates are associated with TASC D lesions and poor initial runoff score; HTN was associated with improved patency rates. Stent occlusion and in-stent stenosis were not entirely benign; one-third of patients had deterioration of their tibial artery runoff. Future studies of SFA interventions need to stratify TASC classification and runoff score. Further evaluation of the long-term effects of SFA stenting on tibial runoff is needed.",

    "abstract": "The optimal treatment for hemodynamically significant infrainguinal vein bypass graft stenosis is not known. This study compares three options as first choice for the revision of failing infrainguinal vein grafts: cutting balloon angioplasty (CBA), standard percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA), and open surgical revision (OS).\nInfrainguinal vein bypass graft lesions treated in a single institution during a 12-year period were evaluated. Of these, 161 lesions in 124 infrainguinal bypasses (101 patients) were treated with OS (n = 42), PTA (n = 57), or CBA (n = 62). The initial indication for the bypass in these patients was limb salvage in 73% and claudication in 27%. The primary outcome of interest was the development of vein graft occlusion or significant stenosis (>or=70%) as detected by surveillance duplex ultrasound scanning or arteriography some time after repair.\nThe stenosis-free patency rates at 48 months for OS, CBA, and PTA were 74%, 62%, and 34%, respectively. PTA was associated with an increased risk of treatment failure compared with both OS (hazard ratio [HR], 3.9; P < .0001) and CBA (HR, 3.1; P < .0001). There was no significant difference between OS and CBA (HR, 1.3 for CBA vs OS, P = .6). Pseudoaneurysms developed in two CBA patients. One ruptured and required interposition graft, and one was monitored.\nCutting balloon angioplasty is a reasonable, initial treatment for infrainguinal vein graft stenosis in most patients. It is a safe, minimally invasive, outpatient procedure with patency rates that are comparable to OS and superior to PTA.",

    "abstract": "Our institution previously reported an association between elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and carotid artery stenosis. Based on this finding, we sought to further evaluate the association of CRP levels with ultrasound progression of carotid artery stenosis, and/or clinical events.\nA prospective observational study of patients evaluated for carotid artery stenosis was performed at a tertiary medical center from 2003-2007. Patients underwent serial lab draws for serum CRP, as well as serial duplex ultrasounds of their carotid bifurcations. Examinations were performed at 6-month intervals. Initial risk factors and CRP levels were evaluated with univariate statistics. Ultrasound progression of disease was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis.\nDuring the study period, 271 patients completed study requirements with a mean follow-up of 37 (+/-6) months. Initial duplex examination revealed 114 (41%) of patients had 0% to 15%, 94 (35%) had 16% to 49%, and 63 (23%) had 50% to 79% stenosis of the carotid bifurcation. Sixty-three patients (23%) demonstrated progression of disease by ultrasound examination, 27 (10%) progressed to carotid endarterectomy, and three (1%) experienced a stroke during follow-up. Mean CRP levels were higher among patients that progressed on duplex examination (6.7 +/- 1.28 vs 4.6 +/- 0.4 mg/dl, P < .05). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant difference in freedom from progression of carotid artery disease for patients with 1(st) and 3(rd) quartile CRP levels (log-rank test P < .05). Adjusting for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, coronary artery disease, aspirin or other anti-inflammatory uses, and statin therapy, 4(th) quartile CRP was independently associated with disease progression (OR 1.8, 95% CI; 1.03-2.99, P < .05).\nHigh CRP levels predict ultrasound progression of disease in patients with carotid artery stenosis. In addition, CRP levels may provide additional information to help guide ultimate therapy for evaluation and follow-up of patients with borderline lesions identified by duplex exam.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzed device-specific aneurysm sac morphology after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with low-permeability devices.\nBetween September 2004 and May 2006, 122 patients were treated with EVAR. Three different devices were implanted: 47 Zenith (Cook, Indianapolis, Ind), 46 AneuRx (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif) with Resilient Dacron Graft Material, and 29 Excluder (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) with low-porosity polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Patients were followed up at 1, 6, and 12 months and then biannually with computed tomography (CT) angiography. Standard axial two-dimensional CT measurements were obtained and compared with preoperative imaging. The preoperative scan served as a baseline, and the minor axis diameter, measured at the largest axial cut of the abdominal aortic aneurysm, was compared with the same measurement at follow-up.\nPatient age, sex, and preoperative aneurysm morphology were similar among groups. Patients receiving the Zenith endograft had a significantly larger neck diameter; however, there was no difference in the neck length between groups. The rate of type II endoleaks was similar for the Zenith (17%), AneuRx (17%), and Excluder (14%). At 1, 6, 12, and 18 months, all three grafts were associated with sac shrinkage. The resulting decreases in mean aneurysm size at 18 months and corresponding shrinkage were Zenith, 11%, 6.4 +/- 1.8 mm; AneuRx, 18.9%, 12.7 +/- 2.7 mm; and the Excluder, 5.5%, 3.3 +/- 0.9 (P < .05). The sac size in the 19 patients with a type II endoleak decreased 8.06% compared with a 15.43% decrease in sac size in patients without endoleak at 6 months. No significant sac expansion > or =5 mm has been observed among any of the groups to date.\nSac regression with all devices appears to have been favorably influenced by the new generation of graft materials and is improved compared with published reports of older generation graft materials for the AneuRx and Excluder. However, there is a trend toward greater sac regression with devices using Dacron vs PTFE. The relationship of aneurysm morphology and long-term effects on aortic stent grafts is yet to be determined.",

Secondary end points were postoperative symptoms (pain, use of analgesics, paresthesia at the ankle, residual hematoma), complications, time taken to resume work, the patient's satisfaction with the cosmetic outcome, and the CIVIQ quality of life score at 16 weeks.\nThe groups were well matched at baseline. In all, 95 patients could be followed up in accordance with the protocol. The treatment was successful in all patients. Endovenous laser ablation was associated with an occlusion rate of 100%. Hematomas were significantly smaller after EVLA (median [quartiles]) at 125 (55-180) cm(2) vs stripping 200 (123-269) cm(2) (P = .001). No difference was registered between groups for the CIVIQ quality of life score, with EVLA at -1.25 (-7.5-11.25) vs stripping at 4.38 (-5.94-14.38; P = .34). Several postoperative symptoms favored EVLA, but the only significant differences were seen in the minor side effects of surgery at 1 and 4 weeks and discomfort due to paresthesia at the ankle in the first postoperative week. EVLA was associated with a longer period of time until return to work (median [quartiles]) of 20 (14-25.5) days vs 14 (12.8-25) days (P = .054).\nEndovenous laser ablation combined with high ligation is safe and effective. Postoperative hematomas are significantly smaller than those after stripping. Short-term quality of life is at least as good as that after stripping. The long-term results warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The optimal prophylactic strategy and treatment regimen for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in hospitalized pediatric patients is not clearly established. This study assessed the incidence, risk factors, and treatment patterns for DVT among pediatric patients admitted to a hospital ward.\nChildren (aged <17 years) admitted to a single tertiary-care hospital during a 14-year period who developed or presented with DVT were retrospectively identified. Patient demographic and clinical data were analyzed retrospectively. Patients who developed DVT in the hospital were stratified according to the Wells clinical probability scoring system from criteria noted before the diagnosis. Treatment patterns and outcomes were evaluated between the two time intervals of 1992 to 2001 (group I) and 2002 to 2005 (group II).\nBetween 1992 and 2005, 358 children were evaluated for DVT, and 99 (52 boys, 47 girls) were admitted to the hospital and were determined to have DVT by confirmatory imaging. A prior DVT (12 total) was present in eight of the 21 patients admitted for DVT treatment; of the remaining, only seven received DVT prophylaxis on admission. In those developing a DVT, the inpatient clinical probability score was 21% (low), 40% (moderate), and 39% (high). The most common risk factor in those with prehospital DVT was a prior DVT (38%) or thrombophilic condition (33%), whereas inpatients had a central catheter (45%), with nearly 50% in the femoral vein. Children acquiring an inpatient DVT had concomitant severe respiratory (17%), oncologic (14%), and/or infectious (15%) diseases and required a prolonged intensive care unit (12.7 days) stay. Prehospital DVT was lower extremity predominant (90%) and statistically different from inpatient-acquired DVT (62%, P = .01). Treatment patterns between periods I and II revealed a trend to more low-molecular-weight heparin and less unfractionated heparin use (P = .09). Three patients died (one fatal pulmonary embolism). The number of recognized cases per 10,000 admissions increased from 0.3 to 28.8 from 1992 to 2005.\nThe incidence of DVT in hospitalized children is increasing. Those presenting with DVT typically have prior DVT, thrombophilia, or lower extremity disease. Our study suggests that children admitted with severe medical conditions who require a prolonged intensive care unit stay in addition to central venous access (especially via the femoral vein) should be considered candidates for DVT prophylaxis. A clinical probability scoring system alone cannot stratify patients sufficiently to forgo prophylaxis in hopes of a rapid clinical diagnosis. Childhood-specific level 1 trials aimed at determining guidelines for DVT prophylaxis are urgently required.",

    "abstract": "The use of a distal filter cerebral protection device with carotid artery stenting is commonplace. There is little evidence, however, that filters are effective in preventing embolic lesions. This study examined the incidence of embolic phenomenon during carotid artery stenting with and without filter use.\nThis was a prospective, randomized, single-center study of carotid artery stenting with or without a distal cerebral protection filter. A 1:1 scheme was used to randomize 36 carotid artery stenting procedures in 35 patients. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW MRI) 24 hours after stenting was used to assess the occurrence of new embolic lesions. Blinded observers calculated lesion number and volume.\nThe mean age was 78.6 +/- 7.0 in the cerebral protection group compared with 74.1 +/- 8.7 in the no cerebral protection group (P = .92). Despite similar average age, the percentage of octogenarians was higher in the cerebral protection group (61.1% vs 22.2%; P = .04). Two procedures in the cerebral protection group were not successful. One was completed without protection because of inability to track the filter, and the second was aborted because of severe tortuosity with a later carotid endarterectomy. New MRI lesions were noted in 72% of the cerebral protection group compared with 44% in the no cerebral protection group (P = .09). The average number of lesions in these patients was 6.1 and 6.2, respectively, with mean DW MRI lesion size of 16.63 mm(3) vs 15.61 mm(3) (P = .79 and .49, respectively). Four strokes occurred (11%), two in each group, in patients aged 75, 80, 82, and 84 years. The only major stroke occurred in the no cerebral protection group.\nThe use of filters during carotid artery stenting provided no demonstrable reduction of microemboli, as expected. Routine use of cerebral protection filters should undergo a more critical assessment before mandatory universal adoption.",

    "abstract": "This study retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of the 6F Angio-Seal (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, Minn) as a closure device for transbrachial artery access for endovascular procedures in diabetic patients with critical limb ischemia.\nFrom January 2005 and September 2007, 1887 diabetic patients underwent interventional procedures in the lower limbs at a two diabetic foot centers. Patients presented with rest pain (16%), ulcers (80%), or gangrene (4%). Systemic anticoagulation with sodium heparin (70 IU/kg) was obtained for all patients at the beginning of the endovascular treatment. A total of 249 brachial arteries (238 patients) were evaluated for possible Angio-Seal use after endovascular recanalization of the leg. Color Doppler ultrasound imaging of the artery was obtained before revascularization only in patients with previous Angio-Seal placement in the brachial artery. No further imaging studies were done in the remaining brachial arteries where the Angio-Seal was deployed at the operator's discretion. Impairment or disappearance of the radial pulse or onsets of hand ischemia or hand pain, or impairment of hand function during or at the end of the endovascular revascularization were all regarded as contraindications to Angio-Seal usage. Evidence of a highly calcified plaque of the brachial artery access site at the time of vessel puncture was regarded as an absolute contraindication to the Angio-Seal use. Patients were seen before discharge, at 1, 3, and 8 weeks after the procedure, and at 3-month intervals thereafter. Complications included hemorrhage, pseudoaneurysm, infection, and vessel occlusion.\nA total of 1947 Angio-Seal collagen plugs were deployed in 1709 diabetic patients (90.5%). The Angio-Seal was used for brachial artery closure in 159 patients (8.4%) in 161 procedures (159 in the left, 2 in the right brachial artery). In 79 patients (4.2%) in 88 procedures (87 in the left and 1 in the right brachial artery), the device was deemed contraindicated due to small vessel size in 73 patients (92.4%) or presence of calcium at the access site in five patients (6.3%). One patient (1.3%) refused the collagen plug closure after revascularization. The non-Angio-Seal group was evaluated for comparison. The success rate for achieving hemostasis in the Angio-Seal group was 96.9%. Five major complications (3.1%) at 30 days consisted of two puncture site hematomas >4 cm, two brachial artery occlusions, and one brachial artery pseudoaneurysm, with three patients requiring open surgery. Minor complications (7.50%) were three puncture site hematomas < 4 cm, three oozing of blood from the access site, and six patients had mild pain in the cubital fossa. No further complications were recorded in the 14-month follow-up (range 1-25 months) of a total of 140 patients.\nThis retrospective study shows that the 6F Angio-Seal is a valuable and safe vascular closure device for transbrachial access in diabetic patients undergoing interventional procedures for critical limb ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Lower extremity arterial injury is a rare complication following total knee (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). To date, no multi-institutional study has identified preoperative factors that may portend increased risk for these injuries. We queried a large clinical database for the incidence and predictors of arterial injury and/or compromise following lower extremity arthroplasty.\nProspectively collected preoperative and postoperative data by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) of the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers were analyzed. All patients from 1996 to 2003 in the NSQIP database who underwent TKA or THA were identified via CPT codes. NSQIP defined, 30-day, postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Data were compared using bivariable analysis, as well as limited multivariable logistic regression.\nA total of 41,633 arthroplasties (24,029 TKA, 2077 redo-TKA, 13,494 THA, 2033 redo-THA) were identified in the NSQIP database. A total of 34 (0.08%) lower extremity arterial injuries were recognized (0.08% TKA, 0.19% redo-TKA, 0.04% THA, 0.20% redo-THA). Eighteen injuries were repaired on the same day of surgery (seven intraop, 11 postop), eight between postoperative days 1 and 5, and 8 between days 6 and 30. Only two patients underwent lower extremity amputation (overall limb loss rate of 5.9% of patients who had arterial injury). Statistically significant predictors of lower extremity arterial injury identified on logistic regression analysis included redo procedure (odds ratio [OR] 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-6.0, P = .013) and African American race (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-5.3, P = .02).\nLower extremity arterial injury was exceedingly rare after total knee or total hip arthroplasty. There is an increased incidence in African American patients and those undergoing redo arthroplasty. Among patients who sustain vascular injury, excellent limb salvage rates can be achieved with close postoperative surveillance to achieve early detection and repair of injuries.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of vascular disease screening is early identification of atherosclerotic disease and the aim of an ankle-brachial index (ABI) is to identify lower extremity (LE) atherosclerosis as a marker for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, early evidence of atherosclerosis may be present in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) with a normal resting ABI. This study was performed to determine if SFA duplex ultrasound (DUS) could detect more patients with LE atherosclerosis than an ABI; be performed in the same or less time as the ABI measurement; and be associated with similar vascular disease markers as the ABI.\nFrom January through November 2006, 585 patients were screened for peripheral arterial disease. SFA DUS was included in this Institutional Review Board approved program and demographic/ultrasound data were collected prospectively. SFA DUS findings were divided into six categories. Plaque w/o color change or worse and ABI <0.90 or >1.20 were considered to be abnormal. Data were evaluated using decision matrix and logistical regression analysis.\nSensitivity and specificity of SFA DUS using the ABI as the benchmark was 100% and 88%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of ABI was 17% and 100%, respectively, using DUS as the standard. DUS detected atherosclerotic disease in 143 SFAs (93 patients) in which the ipsilateral ABI was normal, and there were no false negative SFA DUS studies. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated the following variables to be significantly and independently associated with an abnormal SFA DUS as well as an abnormal ABI: history of claudication, history of myocardial infarction, and an abnormal carotid DUS. Additional variables (current or past smoker and age >55) were also independently associated with an abnormal SFA DUS but not with an abnormal ABI. Mean time to complete bilateral testing was essentially the same for both tests.\nSFA DUS is an accurate screening tool and can be utilized in screening protocols in place of the time-honored ABI without prolonging the examination. Traditional vascular disease markers that are found in patients with an abnormal ABI are also associated with an abnormal SFA DUS. SFA DUS identifies more patients with early LE atherosclerosis than does ABI without missing significant popliteal/tibial artery occlusive disease. Finally, an abnormal SFA DUS can be used as an indirect marker to identify more potentially at risk patients with CAD.",

    "abstract": "The results of treatment for subclavian vein effort thrombosis were assessed in a series of competitive athletes.\nA retrospective review was conducted of high-performance athletes who underwent multidisciplinary management for venous thoracic outlet syndrome in a specialized referral center. The overall time required to return to athletic activity was assessed with respect to the timing and methods of diagnosis, initial treatment, operative management, and postoperative care.\nBetween January 1997 and January 2007, 32 competitive athletes (29 male and 3 female) were treated for venous thoracic outlet syndrome, of which 31% were in high school, 47% were in college, and 22% were professional. The median age was 20.3 years (range, 16-26 years). Venous duplex ultrasound examination in 21 patients had a diagnostic sensitivity of 71%, and the mean interval between symptoms and definitive venographic diagnosis was 20.2 +/- 5.6 days (range, 1-120 days). Catheter-directed subclavian vein thrombolysis was performed in 26 (81%), with balloon angioplasty in 12 and stent placement in one. Paraclavicular thoracic outlet decompression was performed with circumferential external venolysis alone (56%) or direct axillary-subclavian vein reconstruction (44%), using saphenous vein panel graft bypass (n = 8), reversed saphenous vein graft bypass (n = 3), and saphenous vein patch angioplasty (n = 3). In 19 patients (59%), simultaneous creation of a temporary (12 weeks) adjunctive radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula was done. The mean hospital stay was 5.2 +/- 0.4 days (range, 2-11 days). Seven patients required secondary procedures. Anticoagulation was maintained for 12 weeks. All 32 patients resumed unrestricted use of the upper extremity, with a median interval of 3.5 months between operation and the return to participation in competitive athletics (range, 2-10 months). The overall duration of management from symptoms to full athletic activity was significantly correlated with the time interval from venographic diagnosis to operation (r = 0.820, P < .001) and was longer in patients with persistent symptoms (P < .05) or rethrombosis before referral (P < .01).\nSuccessful outcomes were achieved for the management of effort thrombosis in a series of 32 competitive athletes using a multidisciplinary approach based on (1) early diagnostic venography, thrombolysis, and tertiary referral; (2) paraclavicular thoracic outlet decompression with external venolysis and frequent use of subclavian vein reconstruction; and (3) temporary postoperative anticoagulation, with or without an adjunctive arteriovenous fistula. Optimal outcomes for venous thoracic outlet syndrome depend on early recognition by treating physicians and prompt referral for comprehensive surgical management.",

    "abstract": "Carotid body tumor (CBT), an extra-adrenal paraganglioma, represents an uncommon entity arising in chemoreceptor tissue located at the carotid bifurcation. Only a few cases have been reported in the literature in the pediatric age group less than 14 years of age, primarily as case reports. Surgical excision is advisable in almost all ages, however, in childhood, it is known to carry risks and difficulties due to the smaller size of the involved anatomical structures. We report an unusual case of a large (50 x 43 x 30 mm) carotid paraganglioma of Shamblin type III in a 13-year-old female, living at high altitude until the age of 9 years. This cervical mass was present, but smaller in size, several years before admission. However, an intense hypoxic stimulus at high altitude for 2 months at the age of 13 years probably induced a fast growing period of the lesion. The tumor was removed en bloc with the involved carotid segments and vascular continuity was restored by means of a common carotid to internal carotid saphenous vein interposition graft. No malignant behavior or regional metastatic spread of the resected mass was demonstrated. Furthermore, no inheritance pattern between family members was confirmed. A clinical update on CBTs in childhood a propos of this case report is undertaken.",

    "abstract": "The American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) classification remains the most widely used risk-stratification system in the world. However, it is not practical in patients undergoing revascularization procedures because most are classified as ASA III. We hypothesized that ASA III patients can be subdivided into two subgroups, ASA IIIA and ASA IIIB, simply based on their preoperative functional capacity measured in metabolic equivalents (METS) of <4 or > or =4, which would allow the largest group of vascular surgery patients to be appropriately subgrouped for their predicted early and late postoperative morbidity and mortality.\nAll charts of 482 patients (99% men) who underwent revascularization for disabling claudication or critical limb ischemia between June 2001 and October 2006 were reviewed for demographics, comorbidities, operative and interventional details, postoperative complications, and outcomes defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. Preoperative functional capacity information was obtained from the anesthesia records in the electronic charts.\nThere were 35 patients (7%) in ASA II, 371 patients (77%) in ASA III (45% in ASA IIIA, 32% in ASA IIIB) and 76 patients (16%) in ASA IV. The age, albumin level, prevalence of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, renal insufficiency (creatinine >1.5 mg/dL), critical limb ischemia, and length of stay were significantly higher in ASA IIIB than IIIA patients. Significantly more myocardial infarctions and deaths occurred in IIIB than in IIIA patients. The overall survival rate was significantly better in ASA IIIA than in ASA IIIB patients. A univariate Cox proportional model identified coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), renal insufficiency, hypercholesterolemia, presence of critical limb ischemia, and preoperative albumin level of <3 g/dL or > or =3 g/dL as being significantly associated with survival. Multivariate analysis showed being ASA IIIA or IIIB is an independent predictor of survival, after adjusting for age, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, COPD, and preoperative albumin levels.\nFunctional capacity assessment is an integral part of routine preoperative anesthesia evaluation, and we found this to be very reliable in predicting postoperative morbidity and mortality as well as overall survival in ASA III patients undergoing peripheral revascularization. This simple modification allows ASA III patients (approximately 80% of vascular patients) to be unbundled into two very distinct subgroups, which will potentially lead to a more accurate preoperative risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "Renal ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury (IRI) is an important mechanism of acute renal failure (ARF) and a crucial factor of tissue damage during vascular surgery. IR may lead to tissue destruction and influence the early and long-term outcome of organs. The anti-anginal medication trimetazidine (TMZ) is a drug, the protective effects of which have been already assessed during cold preservation and warm ischemia (WI). The objective of this dose-effect study was to assess the role of TMZ in severe renal WI model.\nWe have used an established WI pig kidney model associated with a uninephrectomy condition and studied the dose-dependent role of TMZ (1, 5, and 10 mg/Kg, i.v. for 24 hours before WI) against deleterious effects of WI (60 minutes of WI followed by reperfusion) compared with sham-operated (control) and uninephrectomized animals (unif). Direct effect of TMZ was determined using different variables: renal function (creatinine clearance; C(cr)) and indirectly, the consequences on inflammation (cells infiltration), rate of apoptosis, fibrosis development, and renal epithelial cells change into myofibroblast, which defined epithelial to mesenchymal transition (alpha-smooth muscle actin [alpha-SMA] and vimentin expression).\nTMZ (5 or 10 mg/Kg) significantly increased C(cr) and reduced the inflammatory response prevalent in ischemic kidney injury and rate of apoptosis expression. In addition, the limitation of initial IRI was correlated with an earlier and greater expression of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), which is a hypoxia marker during kidney regeneration. A reduction of the tubulointerstitial development of fibrosis and a limitation of the alpha-smooth muscle actin expression (alpha-SMA) was observed with TMZ treatment. At 3 months, vimentin expression was increased in WI groups without TMZ or low TMZ dose treatment compared with 5 or 10 mg/Kg treated groups.\nCollectively, these data suggest that TMZ made the warm ischemic kidneys more resistant to the deleterious impact of a single episode of IR and could have a role in preserving the ischemic kidney from long-term damage.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesized that a subgroup of patients with frank stroke due to sudden occlusion of the internal carotid artery could safely undergo surgery to restore carotid patency and to rescue brain tissue not yet irreversibly damaged if current stroke diagnostic methods were applied.\nFrom November 1997 to March 2007, 1810 patients underwent carotid endarterectomy of the internal carotid artery for occlusive disease at our department. Within the same period, 5369 patients were examined at our stroke unit, and 502 from this cohort underwent internal carotid artery reconstruction. A subgroup of 35 patients (28 men, 7 women; mean age, 61 +/- 10 years) underwent urgent surgical revascularization due to an acute internal carotid artery occlusion < or =72 hours (mean 25 +/- 17 hours) after the onset of stroke symptoms and < or =36 hours (mean 16 +/- 10 hours) after admission to our stroke unit. Our diagnostic workup consisted of extracranial intracranial duplex sonography, cerebral computed tomography, digital subtraction angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography, including diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging, to discriminate between viable and irreversibly damaged brain tissue. The study excluded patients who presented an impaired level of consciousness, occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery, occlusion of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery, or infarction more than one-third of the territory perfused by the middle cerebral artery. Imaging showed signs of recent ischemic infarction in all 35 cases. On admission, eight patients (23%) scored 0 to 2 points and 27 (77%) scored 3 to 5 points in Rankin scale.\nConfirmed by postoperative Doppler and duplex sonography at discharge, internal carotid artery patency could be achieved in 30 of 35 cases (86%). Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in two patients (6%) and reinfarction in another two (6%). Two patients died during their hospital stay (30-day mortality, 6%). Compared with the preoperative neurologic status, rates of clinical improvement (> or =1 point in Rankin scale), stability, and deterioration were 57%, 31%, and 6%, respectively.\nRestoration of blood flow in an acutely occluded internal carotid artery can only be achieved in the acute stage. Our pilot study demonstrated that a thorough diagnostic workup allows selection of patients who may benefit from urgent revascularization of acute internal carotid artery occlusion in the stage of an acute stroke. A prospective randomized multicenter trial comparing surgery with conservative medical treatment is needed.",

    "abstract": "Widespread application of infrarenal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has resulted in a proportionate increase in open juxtarenal aortic aneurysm (JAA) repairs. Fenestrated endograft technology for JAA is developing rapidly, but only limited outcomes are known. The aim of this study was to review our open JAA experience in an era of fenestrated endograft technology, identify factors associated with increased surgical risk, determine early and midterm outcome, and provide a basis for comparison for future endovascular procedures.\nData from 126 consecutive patients who underwent elective JAA repair requiring suprarenal aortic clamping from 2001 to 2006 were analyzed retrospectively. Electronic medical chart reviews were used to record 30-day complication rates. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors associated with surgical morbidity. Mail-out questionnaires and telephone surveys were conducted to determine long-term follow-up.\nNinety-eight males and 28 females (median age 74 years; range 55 to 93) were included in the study. Preoperative risk factors included: coronary artery disease (CAD) 58%, pulmonary disease 41%, renal insufficiency (serum creatinine [Cr] > 1.5mg/dL) 17%, and diabetes 9%. Fifteen patients underwent concomitant renal artery revascularization. Mean operative time was 319 minutes (range 91 to 648). Thirty-day mortality was 1/126 (0.8%). Median hospital length of stay was 7 days (range 3 to 85); median intensive care unit length of stay was 2 days (1 to 64). Complications included renal insufficiency (Cr increase > 0.5 mg/dL) in 22 (18%), cardiac in 17 (13%), and pulmonary in 14 (11%). Five patients required temporary hemodialysis; only one after hospital dismissal. Mean follow-up was 48 months (range 9-80). On multivariate analysis, age > or = 78 years (P = .001), male gender (P = .04), hypertension (P =.01), previous myocardial infarction (P = .047), and diabetes (P =.009) were predictive of cardiac complications. Renal artery revascularization (P = .01) and prior MI (P = .04) were multivariate predictors of pulmonary complications. Both prolonged operative (> or =351 minutes, P = .02) and renal ischemia (> or =23 minutes, P =.004) times predicted postoperative renal insufficiency. One, 3, and 5-year cumulative survival rates were 93.9%, 78.3%, and 63.8%, respectively and were not significantly different than an age- and gender-matched sample of the US population (P = .16). Mortality was not predicted by any specific risk factors.\nOpen surgical repair of JAA is associated with low mortality and remains the gold standard. Although 18% had renal complications, only one patient had permanent renal failure. Patients with a combination of physiologic and anatomic risk factors identified on multivariate analysis may benefit from fenestrated endograft repair.",

    "abstract": "The management of penetrating subclavian artery injuries poses a formidable surgical challenge. The feasibility of stent graft repair is already established. General use of this modality is not widely accepted due to concerns regarding the long-term outcome in a generally young patient population. We review our stent graft experience to examine long-term outcomes.\nAll patients with penetrating subclavian artery injuries were evaluated for stent graft repair. Patients were excluded when hemodynamically unstable or unsuitable on other clinical and angiographic grounds. Patients were followed prospectively for early (<30 days) and late (>30 days) complications. Clinical and telephone evaluation, Doppler pressures, duplex Doppler, and angiography (when indicated), were used to asses patients at follow-up. Outcomes were recorded as technical success of procedure, graft patency, arm claudication, limb loss, the need for open surgical repair, the presence or absence of other complications, and death.\nFifty-seven patients underwent stent graft treatment during the 10-year period. Mean age was 34, and 91% were men. There were 53 stab wounds and four gunshot injuries. Pathology included false aneurysms (n = 42), arteriovenous fistula (n = 12), and three arterial occlusions. Early complications: One patient (2%) had a femoral puncture site injury which was managed with open surgical repair. One patient died early due to multiple organ failure related to concomitant injuries. Three patients (5%) presented with graft occlusion and nonlimb threatening ischemia in the first week after treatment. All three patients were managed successfully with a second endovascular intervention. Late complications: Twenty-five (44%) of the 57 patients with subclavian artery injuries were followed-up with a mean duration of 48 months. Two patients died as a result of fatal stab wounds months after their first injuries. Five patients (20%) and three patients (12%) presented with angiographically significant stenosis and occlusions, respectively. The stenotic lesions were successfully managed with endovascular intervention, and the occluded lesions were managed conservatively. No patient experienced life or limb loss or any incapacitating symptoms at the end of the study period. There was no need for conversion to open surgery.\nThis study has reaffirmed the feasibility and safety of stent graft repair in treating stable patients with selected penetrating subclavian artery injuries. The results of this study also confirmed acceptable long-term follow-up without any limb or life threatening complications. We conclude that endovascular repair should be considered the first choice of treatment in stable patients with subclavian artery injuries.",

    "abstract": "This clinical study evaluated prospectively adverse events immediately following ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) for the treatment of lower extremity venous valvular insufficiency. Incidence of side effects associated with carbon dioxide (CO(2)) foam was compared with a historical control using air-based foam. The literature on the subject was reviewed.\nVital signs were monitored during and immediately after UGFS, and adverse events were recorded for 24 hours following the procedure. The air-based foam group had 49 patients: 44 women and 5 men. The CO(2)-based foam group had 128 patients: 115 women and 13 men. CEAP class was C2EpAsPr, describing varicose veins, primary etiology, and saphenous reflux. UGFS followed thermal ablation of the great saphenous vein. Foam was prepared using the three-way tap technique to mix gas with 1% polidocanol in a 4:1 ratio. Segments of the great and small saphenous veins and their tributaries were treated with UGFS. Foam volumes injected were 27 +/- 10 (SD) (6-46 range) and 25 +/- 12 (6-57 range) mL for air- and CO(2)-based foams respectively (P = .39). Incidence of adverse events was compared by chi(2) statistics. Vital signs were compared by paired t test.\nDuring the procedure, the average heart rate decreased by less than 5 bpm for both groups (P < .001), and blood pressure decreased by less than 3 mm Hg in the CO(2) group (P < .02). Respiratory rate, electrocardiogram, and pulse oxymetry did not change significantly in both air- and CO(2)-foam series (P > .05). Visual disturbances were experienced by 3.1% (4/128) and 8.2% (4/49) patients in the CO(2) and air groups respectively (P = .15). Respiratory difficulties or circumoral paresthesia each occurred in 0.8% (n = 1) of the CO(2) patients. Incidence of chest tightness (3.1% vs 18%), dry cough (1.6% vs 16%), or dizziness (3.1% vs 12%) were significantly lower in the CO(2) vs air groups (P < .02). Nausea occurred in 2% and 4% of the CO(2) and air-based foam groups (P = .53). Overall, the proportion of patients describing side effects decreased from 39% (19/49) to 11% (14/128) as CO(2) replaced air for foam preparation (P < .001). Similar findings were described in the literature of air-based foam but data on the use of physiological gas were rare.\nSide effects decreased significantly if CO(2) rather than air was employed to make the sclerosing foam for chemical ablation of superficial veins of the lower extremity.",

This study was conducted to define the characteristics of patients with splanchnic artery dissection and the clinical course of isolated splanchnic artery dissection.\nThe records of 19 patients were reviewed to survey demographic data, the location of dissection, symptoms, diagnostic modalities, treatment, and long-term outcome.\nThe locations of dissection were the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) in 11 patients, celiac artery in 3, both celiac artery and SMA in 2, and common hepatic artery, celiac artery to splenic artery, and celiac artery to proper hepatic artery in 1 each. In all but one with systemic sclerosis and Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, the underlying cause of dissection was unclear. There were 12 asymptomatic and seven symptomatic patients. All cases were diagnosed by computed tomography. Surgical treatment was performed in one patient with a large aneurysm of the common hepatic artery, and the remaining 18 patients were followed-up conservatively. The mean follow-up duration was 20.9 +/- 25.4 months (range, 2-116 months). No expansion or progression of the false lumen was observed in these patients.\nPatients with spontaneous dissection of the splanchnic arteries are often asymptomatic, and in this series, none developed significant end organ ischemia.

    "abstract": "Increased venous hydrostatic pressure plays a role in the pathogenesis of varicose veins. Increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been identified in varicose veins. Also, we have shown that MMP-2 inhibits venous contraction. However, the relation between venous pressure, MMP expression, and venous dysfunction is unclear. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that prolonged increases in venous wall tension cause overexpression of MMPs and decreased contractility, which in turn promote venous dilation.\nCircular segments of inferior vena cava (IVC) were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats and suspended between two wires in Krebs solution. Preliminary vein wall tension-contraction relation showed maximal potassium chloride (KCl) (96 mmol/L) contraction at 0.5 g basal tension, which remained steady with increases in tension up to 2 g. Vein segments were subjected to either control (0.5 g) or high (2 g) basal tension for short (1 hour) or long duration (24 hours). Isometric contraction in response to phenylephrine (Phe, 10(-5) mol/L), angiotensin II (AngII, 10(-6) mol/L), and KCl was measured. The veins were frozen to determine the expression and localization of MMPs using immunoblots and immunohistochemistry.\nIn IVC segments subjected to 0.5 g tension for 1 hour, Phe and AngII produced significant contraction. At higher 2 g basal tension for 24 hours, both Phe and AngII contractions were significantly reduced. Reduction in KCl contraction was also observed at high 2 g basal tension for 24 hours, suggesting that the reduction in vein contraction is not specific to a particular receptor, and likely involves inhibition of a post-receptor contraction mechanism. In vein segments under 2 g tension for 24 hours and treated with TIMP-1, Phe, AngII, and KCl contractions were partially restored, suggesting the involvement of MMPs. IVC immunoblot analysis demonstrated prominent bands corresponding to MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein. High 2 g wall tension for 24 hours was associated with marked increase in the amount of MMP-2 and -9 relative to the housekeeping protein actin. There was a correlation between MMP expression and decreased vein contraction. Also, significant increases in MMP-2 and -9 immunostaining were observed in IVC segments subjected to high 2 g tension for 24 hours. Both MMP-2 and MMP-9 caused significant inhibition of Phe contraction in IVC segments.\nIn rat IVC, increases in magnitude and duration of wall tension is associated with reduced contraction and overexpression of MMP-2 and -9. In light of our findings that MMP-2 and -9 promote IVC relaxation, the data suggest that protracted increases in venous pressure and wall tension increase MMPs expression, which in turn reduce venous contraction and lead to progressive venous dilation.",

    "abstract": "Age greater than 80 has been identified as a risk factor for complications, including stroke and death, in patients undergoing carotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS). This study evaluates other potential predictors of perioperative complications in patients undergoing CAS.\nAll cerebrovascular endovascular procedures performed by the vascular surgery division at our university hospital between July 2003 and December 2005 were retrospectively examined. During the course of 212 admissions, 198 patients underwent 215 procedures. Patient age, comorbidities, and admission status were analyzed as independent (predictor) variables. Complication rate, discharge disposition, and length of hospital stay were considered dependent (outcome) variables. Logistic regression and Fisher exact test or Student t test were performed, as appropriate.\nComplications included major and minor stroke, myocardial infarction, femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, and death. The rates of perioperative major and minor stroke were 0.5% and 2.8%, respectively. Chronic renal insufficiency was a predictor of perioperative complications, including stroke: patients with serum creatinine greater than 1.3 mg/dL had a 37% complication rate and a 11.1% stroke rate, while those with normal renal function had a 13% complication rate (P = .003) and a 0.6% stroke rate (P =.001). Similar association was seen between creatinine clearance and both stroke and complications. Obesity was a risk factor for complications, but not stroke: obese patients had a complication rate of 28%, while others had a 16% complication rate (P = .024). Emergency admission predicted both extended hospital stay (P < .001) and requirement for further inpatient care in a rehabilitation or nursing facility (P = .007). There was no significant difference in complication rate or stroke rate between octogenarians and others.\nThis experience demonstrates that chronic renal insufficiency, obesity, and emergent clinical setting are risk factors for patients undergoing CAS.",

    "abstract": "Recent data suggest that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) may be appropriate primary therapy for critical limb ischemia (CLI). However, little data are available regarding infrapopliteal angioplasty outcomes based on TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus (TASC) classification. We report our experience with infrapopliteal angioplasty stratified by TASC lesion classification.\nFrom February 2004 to March 2007, 176 consecutive limbs (163 patients) underwent infrapopliteal angioplasty for CLI. Stents were placed for lesions refractory to PTA or flow-limiting dissections. Patients were stratified by TASC classification and suitability for bypass grafting. Primary outcome was freedom from restenosis, reintervention, or amputation. Primary patency, freedom from secondary restenosis, limb salvage, reintervention by repeat angioplasty or bypass, and survival were determined.\nMedian age was 73 years (range, 39-94 years). Technical success was 93%. Average follow-up was 10 months (range, 1-41 months). At 1 and 2 years, freedom from restenosis, reintervention, or amputation was 39% and 35%, conventional primary patency was 53% and 51%, and freedom from secondary restenosis and reintervention were 63% and 61%, respectively. Limb salvage was 84% at 1, 2, and 3 years. Within 2 years, 15% underwent bypass and 18% underwent repeat infrapopliteal PTA. Postoperative complications occurred in 9% and intraprocedural complications in 10%. The 30-day mortality was 5% (9 of 181). Overall survival was 81%, 65%, and 54% at 1, 2, and 3 years. TASC D classification predicted diminished technical success (75% D vs 100% A, B, and C; P < .001), primary restenosis, reintervention, or amputation (hazard ratio [HR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-5.5, P < .001), primary patency (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.9, P < .004), secondary restenosis (HR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6-6.4, P = .001), and limb salvage (HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1-6.3, P < .05). Unsuitability for surgical bypass also predicted restenosis, reintervention, or amputation, secondary restenosis, need for repeated angioplasty, and inferior primary patency and limb salvage rates.\nInfrapopliteal angioplasty is a reasonable primary treatment for CLI patients with TASC A, B, or C lesions. Restenosis, reintervention, or amputation was higher in patients who were unsuitable candidates for bypass; however, an attempt at PTA may be indicated as an alternative to primary amputation. Although restenosis, reintervention, or amputation is high after tibial angioplasty for CLI, excellent limb salvage rates may be obtained with careful follow-up and reinterventions when necessary, including bypass in 15%.",

    "abstract": "Little data exist to support the durability of thoracic endovascular repair during prolonged periods of follow-up. This study examines the durability and long-term results with the Zenith TX1 and TX2 thoracic devices (Cook Inc, Bloomington, Ind) in high-risk patients.\nData were collected prospectively from 2001 to 2007 on high-risk patients who presented with thoracic aneurysms, chronic aortic dissection, or fistulas treated with a Zenith thoracic device. Surgical modifications of proximal or distal landing zones were performed when necessary. Computed tomography follow-up scans were performed before discharge, at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Three-dimensional reconstruction software with central line of flow measurements was used to assess aortic morphologic characteristics. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess survival, freedom from reintervention, predictive factors of poor outcome, and morphologic changes, including aneurysm sac behavior.\nA total of 160 patients (44% women; mean age, 70) were treated for 130 thoracic aneurysms, 25 aortic dissections with aneurysm, 2 fistulas, and 3 symptomatic or aortic ruptures, or both. Mean follow-up was 36 months, and aneurysm size was 67 mm. Seventy-five patients (47%) had undergone prior aortic aneurysm repair. Surgical modifications were required to create adequate landing zones in 33% patients, including 28 elephant trunk/arch reconstruction, 22 carotid-subclavian bypasses, and seven visceral vessel bypasses. Iliac conduits were required in 31 patients. Early mortality (<30 days) occurred in 11 patients (6.9%). Overall mortality at 1 year was 16%. Aneurysm sac increase (>5 mm) requiring intervention was observed only in one patient in the settings of component separation and type III endoleak that was treated; the sac is now stable. Twenty-seven endoleaks were detected in 25 patients: 15 primary endoleaks (9.4%) <30 days and 12 secondary endoleaks (7.5%) >30 days. Secondary interventions were required in 42 patients (26%).\nEndovascular treatment of thoracic aortic pathologies with the Zenith TX1 and TX2 devices is feasible and durable. The mid- to long-term results are encouraging, with acceptable low reintervention rates and with good survival within high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "This study determined the average estimated total costs after treatment for peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and evaluated the effect of postoperative complications and their consequences for the total costs.\nCost data on all admissions involving treatment for PAOD from January 2007 until July 2007 were collected. A prospective analysis was made using the patient-related risk factor and comorbidity (Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society of Cardiovascular Surgeons) classification, primary and secondary treatment, and prospectively registered complications. At admission, patients without complications were placed in group A, and those with complications were in group B. Prospectively registered complications were divided into patient management (I), surgical technique (II), patient's disease (III), and outside surgical department (IV). The consequences of these were divided into minor complication, no long-term consequence (1A), additional medication or transfusion (1B), surgical reoperation (2A), prolonged hospital stay (2B), irreversible physical damage (3), and death (4). The main outcome measures were total costs of patients and costs per patient (PP), with or without the presence of complications, cost of complications and costs per complication (PC), and the costs of their consequences calculated in euros (euro).\nNinety patients (mean age, 71.4 years; 59% men) were included. Group B patients had a significantly higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (4) and Fontaine (3) classification and more secondary procedures. Total costs were euro 1,716,852: group A, euro 512,811 (PP euro 12,820); and group B, euro 1,204,042 (PP euro 24,081). The costs of the 115 complications were euro 568,500 (PC euro 4943). Split by the cause of the complication, costs were I, euro 95,924 (PC euro 2998); II, euro 163,137 (PC euro 8157); III, euro 289,578 (PC euro 5171); and IV, euro 19,861 (PC euro 2837). The increase of costs in group B was mainly caused by additional medication or transfusion (1B) euro 348,293 (61.3%), a surgical reoperation (2A) euro 118,054 (20.8%), or prolonged hospital stay (2B) euro 60,451 (10.6%). Patients who died caused 23% of the total costs.\nComplications cause an increase of the average estimated total costs in the treatment for peripheral arterial occlusive disease and are responsible for 33% of these total costs. The most expensive complications were errors in surgical technique and patient's disease, resulting in surgical reoperation or additional medication, or both, or transfusion, the two most expensive consequences.",

    "abstract": "Peroneal artery bypass is effective for limb salvage (LS), however, the efficacy of peroneal artery-only runoff (PAOR) following endovascular (EV) interventions is unknown. The goal of our article was to compare the efficacy of EV interventions with PAOR to those with other runoff vessels for LS in patients presenting with tissue loss.\nA retrospective review of 111 consecutive patients who underwent infrainguinal EV revascularizations for nonhealing ulcers/gangrene between June 2001 and December 2006 was performed. Patients with PAOR (n = 33) were compared with those with other vessel runoff (OTHER, n = 78). Fisher exact test and chi2 test were used for comparing variables, Kaplan-Meier analyses for patency, LS, and Cox regression multivariate analysis was used for identifying factors associated with limb loss.\nThe patients in PAOR were older, but other morbidities were similar between groups. The most distal level of intervention was infrapopliteal (tibioperoneal or peroneal artery) in 42% in PAOR group whereas this was 24% in OTHER group (P = .071). Preoperative ankle-brachial index (ABI) was similar (0.49 +/- 0.23 vs 0.50 +/- 0.23), however, postprocedure ABI was significantly less for patients with PAOR (0.76 +/- 0.21 vs 0.92 +/- 0.13, P = .001). The primary patency, assisted primary patency, secondary patency and LS were not significantly different between groups. There was also no difference in time-to healing between groups (PAOR vs OTHER, 2.9 +/- 2.1 mo vs 3.7 +/- 3.6 mo, P = .319). We found the presence of gangrene (odds ratio [OR]: 3.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-10.8, P = .028) and dialysis-dependence (OR: 2.9, 95% CI, 1.0-8.2, P = .046) to be associated with limb loss, when adjusted for diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, location of wound, and PAOR.\nEndovascular revascularization with PAOR results in acceptable patency and limb salvage rates in patients presenting with tissue loss, and is equivalent to other vessel runoff for patency, limb salvage and wound healing rates.",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the macroscopically non-diseased infrarenal aortic neck of AAA is histologically and biochemically altered at the time of operative repair.\nWe harvested full-thickness aortic wall samples as longitudinal stripes spanning from AAA neck to aneurysmal sac in 22 consecutive patients undergoing open surgical AAA repair. Control tissue was obtained from five organ donors and five deceased subjects undergoing autopsy without evidence of aneurysmal disease. We assessed aortic media thickness, number of intact elastic lamellar units, media destruction, and neovascularization grade and performed immunohistochemistry for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK). MMP-9 and p-JNK protein expressions were quantified using Western Blots.\nThe median thickness of the aortic media was 1150 mum in control tissue (range, 1000-1300), 510 mum in aortic necks (250-900), and 200 mum in aortic sacs (50-500, P from nonparametric test for trend <.001). The number of intact elastic lamellar units was 33 in controls (range, 33-55), 12 in aortic necks (0-31) and three in aortic sacs (0-10, P < .001).

Except for p-JNK expression, differences between tissues were similar after the adjustment for age, gender, and type of sampling.\nThe seemingly non-diseased infrarenal AAA neck in patients with AAA undergoing surgical repair shows histological signs of destruction and upregulation of potential drug targets.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to provide insight into the incidence of thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair following previous infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery and to determine whether thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair after prior infrarenal AAA surgery is associated with higher mortality and morbidity rates.\nMEDLINE, Cochrane Library CENTRAL, and EMBASE databases were searched for relevant articles. Selected articles were critically appraised and meta-analyses were performed.\nA total of 12.4% of patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms and 18.7% of patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms have had prior AAA surgery. The chance of developing a thoracic aortic aneurysm in patients with AAA is 2.2% and 2.5% for developing a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. The mean time interval between prior AAA surgery and subsequent thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgery or detection is 8.0 years with a wide variation between individuals. Surgery in these patients is technically feasible. The 30-day mortality of patients undergoing open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair does not significantly differ from patients without prior AAA surgery and the 30-day mortality is 11.8%. No data were available about mortality of patients with prior AAA repair undergoing thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery. Morbidity risks are higher in patients with thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Prior AAA repair was a significant risk factor for neurological deficit after thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms surgery with relative risks (RRs) of 11.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.8-32.3, P value < .0001) and 2.90 (95% CI 1.26-6.65, P value = .008), respectively. Prior AAA repair was a significant risk factor for developing renal failure in patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.74-6.91, P value = .0001). Determinants of the prognosis in these patients include distal aortic perfusion, distal extent of the landing zone of the graft, drainage of cerebrospinal fluid for thoracic aortic aneurysm repair and age, history of cardiac diseases, extent of the aneurysm, rupture, amount of estimated blood loss, aortic clamp time, and visceral ischemic times for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.\nA considerable group of patients with thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms have had prior AAA repair. The risk of postoperative morbidity is increased in these patients. Mortality appears to be similar for patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Patients with prior AAA repair undergoing thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair should be provided maximum care to protect their spinal cord and renal function.",

    "abstract": "Impaired dynamic cerebral autoregulation (DCA) has been shown in patients with severe (> or =70%) internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, but DCA in moderate (50% to 69%) ICA stenosis, especially its response to carotid revascularization, has rarely been reported. Our study aimed to characterize DCA in severe and moderate ICA stenosis before and after carotid stenting.\nThis study included 21 patients with ICA stenosis > or =50% who received carotid stenting. Data of arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery, measured by transcranial Doppler, were collected for 10 minutes < or =24 hours before and after stenting. The DCA index, represented as aMx, was assessed by calculating the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient of spontaneous arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity fluctuations. The relationship between aMx and stenotic severity and also alternations of aMx before and after stenting were assessed.\nCarotid stenting was effective to improve the DCA in the stenting side but not in the contralateral nonstenting side. In considering individual ICAs, the average aMx (mean +/- SD) increased significantly from ICA stenosis <50% (0.117 +/- 0.091) to 50% to 69% (0.349 +/- 0.144), 70% to 99% (0.456 +/- 0.147), and total occlusion (0.557 +/- 0.210; P < .05, P < .01, and P < .01, compared with 50% to 69%, 70% to 99%, or total occlusion with <50% stenosis). The correlation between the degree of ICA stenosis and the aMx was also significant (r = 0.693, P < .005). The aMx improved significantly in the stented side after carotid stenting in both moderate and severe ICA stenosis, and this finding was not affected by age, sex, risk factors, or clinical symptoms.\nIn addition to patients with severe carotid stenosis, patients with moderate carotid stenosis may also have impaired DCA that can be restored after carotid stenting.",

    "abstract": "The use of intravascular stents in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) continues to be controversial due to the potential for compression and fracture in the tortuous physical environment of the adductor canal. The purpose of this study was to (1) characterize the types and ranges of stent distortion theoretically produced by extremity movement and (2) use these ranges as parameters for in vitro long-term fatigue testing of commercially available self-expanding nitinol stents.\nNitinol self-expanding stents were placed in the SFAs of cadavers and lateral view radiographs were obtained with the limb in various degrees of hip and knee flexion. The measured degrees of axial shortening and bending of the stent were estimated by planimetry and used for in vitro fatigue testing, which was undertaken using specially designed equipment. Six different commercially available nitinol self-expanding stents-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 EverFlex (EV3, Minneapolis, Minn), S.M.A.R.T. Control (Cordis/Johnson & Johnson, Miami Lakes, Fla), Luminexx (C.R. Bard, Murray Hill, NJ), LifeStent FlexStar (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, Calif), and Xceed and Absolute (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, Calif)-were mounted in elastic silicone tubing, bathed in phosphate buffered saline at 37 degrees +/- 2 degrees C, and examined for fracture after 10 million cycles of chronic deformation.\nFor unstented arteries, the distal SFA/proximal popliteal artery exhibited the greatest axial compression (23%) vs the middle SFA (9%) or popliteal artery (14%) at 90 degrees /90 degrees knee/hip flexion. For stented arteries, the popliteal artery exhibited the most axial compression (11%) vs the middle SFA (3%) or distal SFA/proximal popliteal artery (6%) at 90 degrees /90 degrees knee/hip flexion. Axial compression of the stented popliteal artery at 70 degrees /20 degrees knee/hip flexion was 6% with a deflection angle of 33 degrees . These parameters were used for chronic in vitro fatigue testing, which produced a range of responses in commercially available stents. Chronic 5% axial compression resulted in high rates of fracture of Luminexx (80%) and LifeStent FlexStar (50%), with lower fracture rates for Absolute (3%), Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 EverFlex (0%), and S.M.A.R.T. Control stents (0%). Chronic 48 degrees bending deformation resulted in high rates of fracture in Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 EverFlex (100%), S.M.A.R.T. Control (100%), and Luminexx stents (100%), with lower rates in Absolute (3%) and LifeStent FlexStar (0%).\nNitinol self-expanding stents undergo both axial and bending deformation when implanted into the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. Commercially available stents exhibit a variable ability to withstand chronic deformation in vitro, and their response is highly dependent on the type of deformation applied.",

    "abstract": "Endoluminal grafting is emerging as a less invasive alternative to the treatment of descending thoracic aorta diseases. Endoleaks (continued pressurization of the treated aorta external to the endoluminal graft) are a potential complication. We reviewed our cumulative endovascular experience for descending thoracic aorta pathologies with respect to the management of endoleaks and associated patient outcomes.\nAs part of a single-site investigational device-exemption protocol, 249 patients (146 men, 103 women) with thoracic aortic diseases underwent attempted delivery of a TAG endoprosthesis (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) between February 2000 and August 2005. Indications for study enrollment included 111 atherosclerotic aneurysms (44.6%), 67 aortic dissections (26.9%), 27 penetrating aortic ulcers (10.8%), 14 contained ruptures (5.6%), 11 pseudoaneurysms (4.4%), 9 acute aortic transections (3.6%), 7 aortobronchial fistulas (2.8%), 2 endoleaks (0.8%) after prior thoracic endoluminal grafting, and 1 (0.4%) adult coarctation. Endoleak surveillance was performed using serial computed tomography scans.\nMean patient age was 68 years (range, 23-91 years). Endoleak developed in 38 patients (15.3%): 15 distal type I (39.5%), 13 proximal type I (34.2%), 8 type II (21.1%) and 2 type III (5.3%). No surgical intervention was performed in 26 patients (68.4%), in which the endoleak spontaneously resolved in 14 (53.8%), 8 (30.8%) are being monitored and are asymptomatic, 3 (11.5%) died of unrelated causes, 2 (7.7%) withdrew from the study, and 1 (3.8%) was lost to follow-up. Twelve patients (31.6%) required reintervention using an additional endoluminal graft: 8 (66.7%) with a proximal type I endoleak, 2 (16.7%) with a distal type I endoleak, 1 (8.3%) with both distal type I and type III endoleaks, and 1 (8.3%) with a type III endoleak. Open conversions were necessary secondary to device deployment difficulties in two patients (0.8%), and due to expansion of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm and rupture of an aneurysm secondary to a type II endoleak in one patient (0.5%) each.\nEndoleaks are an infrequent, yet important, complication after thoracic endografting. Many endoleaks will resolve spontaneously, but some patients may require another endovascular intervention. Close surveillance is recommended for these patients; however, open conversion is rarely indicated. Because more diseases of the thoracic aorta are being treated using an endovascular approach, a standardized treatment algorithm is essential to safely and effectively manage associated endoleaks.",

    "abstract": "This study describes our experience of total laparoscopic juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (JAAA) repair.\nBetween February 2002 and October 2007, we performed 148 total laparoscopic AAA repairs, including a subset of 13 patients who underwent a laparoscopic JAAA repair. Median age was 70 years (range, 50-81years). Median aneurysm size was 55 mm (range, 50-80 mm). Eight patients were in American Society of Anesthesiologist class II, and five were in class III. We used laparoscopic transperitoneal left retrorenal approaches and suprarenal clamping in all patients.\nWe implanted tube grafts in nine patients and bifurcated grafts in four. No conversions to open repair were required. Median operative time was 260 minutes (range, 180-355 minutes). Total median aortic clamping time was 77 minutes (range, 36-105 minutes). Median suprarenal clamping time was 24 minutes (range, 9-37 minutes). Median blood loss was 855 mL (range, 215-2100 mL). No patients died. One patient had a postoperative coagulopathy with hemorrhagic syndrome. Five patients had moderate systemic complications, including four renal insufficiencies without dialysis and one grade I ischemic colitis. Liquid diet was reintroduced after 1 day (range, 1-7 days). Most patients were ambulatory by day 3 (range, 2-17 days). Median lengths of stay were 48 hours (range, 12-336 hours) in the intensive care unit and 10 days (range, 4-30 days) in the hospital. With a median follow-up of 19 months (range, 1-36 months), patients had complete recovery without graft anomalies.\nTotal laparoscopic JAAA repair is feasible and worthwhile for patients. Prior experience in laparoscopic aortic surgery is essential to perform these challenging procedures. Despite these encouraging results, a greater experience is required to ensure the benefit of this technique compared with open repair.",

    "abstract": "Paraplegia after thoracoabdominal aneurysm (TAA) repair has been associated with poor survival. Little information exists concerning the spectrum of severity that characterizes spinal cord ischemic (SCI) complications. This study stratified SCI by deficit severity to determine its impact on late survival and functional outcomes.\nA review of our prospectively maintained thoracic aortic database was performed from May 1987 through December 2005 to identify patients who experienced SCI of any extent after TAA repair. During this period, 576 patients underwent descending thoracic aortic repair (93 open, 105 endovascular [TEVAR]) or open TAA repair (279 extent I to III; 99 extent IV). To stratify severity of SCI, we created a spinal cord ischemia deficit (SCID) scale, which is defined as: I, flaccid paralysis; II, average neurologic muscle grade indicating <50% function; and III, average neurologic muscle grade indicating >50% function. Long-term outcomes were evaluated in relation to these groups by actuarial methods.\nDuring the study period, 64 (11.1%) patients developed SCI of any severity (7 of 105 [6.6%] TEVAR, 57 of 471 [12%] open). These were stratified by SCID level: I, 24 (37.5%); II, 31 (48.4%); and III, 9 (14.1%). SCI was immediate in 33 (54.1%) and delayed in 28 (45.9%). Most SCI (6 of 7) associated with TEVAR was delayed. The 30-day mortality was significantly higher in the SCI group than the overall patient cohort (15 of 64 [23.4%] vs 41 of 512 [8%], P < .001) and varied by SCID level: I, 11 of 24 (45.8%); II, 4 of 31 (12.9%); and III, 0 of 9 (0%; P = .001). The 5-year actuarial survival for all SCI was lower than for non-SCI patients (25% +/- 6% vs 51% +/- 3%, P < .001) and varied linearly with SCID level but was similar between SCID II/III and the non-SCI patients (41% +/- 10% vs 51% +/- 3%, P = .281). No SCID I patients were alive at 5 years. No patients with SCID I recovered the ability to walk, but eight of 11 (73%) with SCID II and the nine (100%) with SCID III could ambulate with or without assistance at last follow-up.\nSurvival and functional outcomes correlate with SCI severity. Patients with SCID I have a poor long-term outlook. Survival of SCID II/III patients is similar to non-SCI patients; most recover the ability to ambulate.",

    "abstract": "Microthrombi are undoubtedly the most common embolic material in the cerebral circulation, originating from even minor irregularities of the arterial wall, fibrillating atria, cardiac valves, and patent foramen ovale. Thrombus fragments are globular and likely to completely obstruct terminal vessels. In contrast, previous work with \"atheroemboli\" of needle-like cholesterol crystals rarely cause occlusions or infarctions instead creating small foci of inflammation. In this work, we asked if microthrombi would occlude terminal vessels and create lacunar type infarctions in the subcortical tissues of the rat brain where, as in human brain, collateral flow is limited relative to the cortex.\nThree treatment groups of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. All groups underwent general anesthesia with monitoring of temperature and blood pressure during cannulation of the right internal carotid artery. In the group embolized with thrombus fragments (n = 12), animals had injections of 300 fragments of thrombus size 60 to 100 microns, the cholesterol group (n = 6) had injections of 300 cholesterol crystals of similar size, and the control group (n = 4) had injections of saline. Brains were harvested at 4 days with perfusion fixation and were examined by immunohistochemical staining for breaks in the blood brain barrier (BBB) (albumin), microglial activation (CD11b), astrocyte activation (GFAP), and infarction (loss of NeuN staining). Size and location of the areas of injury and infarction were recorded.\nClot fragments caused discreet infarcts in 10/12 animals that were 0.1-1.7 mm in diameter and coincided with activation of microglia and astrocytes. In some areas, necrosis was already underway at this early time point. Consistent with our previous work, the infarcts caused by cholesterol crystals were smaller (P = .014). Foci of BBB disruption and microglial activation were distributed throughout the brain whereas areas of infarction were found almost exclusively in subcortical tissues (P = .029).\nInjecting microthrombi reproducibly caused areas of necrosis resembling lacunar type infarctions. These were primarily located in the striatum and thalamus presumably because these areas lack the branching, collateral network seen in the cortex. In addition, these data give further evidence that the extent of brain injury from emboli depends upon composition and shape as well as size.",

    "abstract": "Acute arterial thrombosis causes endothelial dysfunction due to decreased nitric oxide bioactivity. Increased arginase activity may modulate intracellular L-arginine levels, the substrate for nitric oxide. The purpose of this study was to identify the role of arginase in endothelial dysfunction in cell culture and in the vasomotor response of arteries exposed to thrombus.\nRat aortic endothelial cells were exposed to thrombin at different time points. The cell extract was analyzed by immunoblotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Adult male rats underwent infrarenal aortic thrombosis by clip ligature for 1 hour. Infrarenal aortic ring segments were harvested and placed in physiologic buffer baths, and a force transducer was used to measure endothelial-dependent relaxation (EDR) and endothelial-independent relaxation (EIR). Arginase blockade was performed by incubating infrarenal aortic ring segments with arginase inhibitors for 1 hour before measuring EDR. Whole tissue extracts also underwent immunoblot analysis. The EDR and EIR curves were compared with analyses of variance.\nA 6.76 +/- 1.4-fold induction in arginase I message levels (P = .001) was found in rat aortic endothelial cells exposed to thrombin (30 U/mL), and arginase I protein levels increased 2.1 times. The eight infrarenal aortic ring segments exposed to thrombosis for 1 hour had diminished EDR curves compared with 14 nonthrombosed normal segments (controls). The maximum (+/- SEM) EDR (acetylcholine 10(-5)M dose) in control infrarenal aortic ring segments was 108% +/- 4.3% compared with 63% +/- 6.2% for thrombosed infrarenal aortic ring segments (P < .001). Exposure to arterial thrombosis resulted in a 3.8-times increase in arginase I protein levels in infrarenal aortic ring segments. Preincubation of nine infrarenal aortic ring segments with the nonspecific (difluoromethylornithine) and six with specific ([S]-[2-boronoethyl]-L-Cysteine-HCl [BEC]) arginase inhibitor for 1 hour significantly increased the maximum EDR compared with untreated thrombosed segments (104 +/- 5.2, 108 +/- 7.6 vs 63% +/- 6.2, P < .001). EDR curves for difluoromethylornithine- and BEC-treated infrarenal aortic ring segments were superimposed on control EDR curves. The EIR and the vasoconstriction with norepinephrine for all groups were similar.\nEndothelial cells exposed to thrombin have increased arginase I messenger RNA and protein levels. Arterial thrombosis causes endothelial dysfunction without affecting smooth muscle responsiveness. Arginase blockade can lead to normalization of arterial vasomotor function.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been shown to be effective in stroke prevention for patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Although several prospective randomized trials indicate that carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an alternative but not superior treatment modality, there is still a significant lack of long-term data comparing CAS with CEA. This study presents long-term results of a prospective, randomized, single-center trial.\nBetween August 1999 and April 2002, 87 patients with a symptomatic high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis (>70%) were randomized to CAS or CEA. After a median observation time of 66 +/- 14.2 months (CAS) and 64 +/- 12.1 months (CEA), 42 patients in each group were re-evaluated retrospectively by clinical examination and documentation of neurologic events. Duplex ultrasound imaging was performed in 61 patients (32 CAS, 29 CEA), and patients with restenosis >70% were re-evaluated by angiography.\nDuring the observation period, 23 patients (25.2%) died (10 CAS, 13 CEA), and three were lost to follow up. The incidence of strokes was higher after CAS, with four strokes in 42 CAS patients vs none in 42 CEA patients. One transient ischemic attack occurred in each group. A significantly higher rate of restenosis >70% (6 of 32 vs 0 of 29) occurred after CAS compared with CEA. Five of 32 CAS patients (15.6%) presented with high-grade (>70%) restenosis as an indication for secondary intervention or surgical stent removal, and three presented with neurologic symptoms. No CEA patients required reintervention (P < .05 vs CAS). A medium-grade (<70%) restenosis was detected in eight of 32 CAS patients (25%) and in one of 29 CEA patients (3.4%). In five of 32 CAS (15.6%) and three of 29 CEA patients (10.3%), a high-grade stenosis of the contralateral carotid artery was observed and treated during the observation period.\nThe long-term results of this prospective, randomized, single-center study revealed a high incidence of relevant restenosis and neurologic symptoms after CAS. CEA seems to be superior to CAS concerning the development of restenosis and significant prevention of stroke. However, the long-term results of the ongoing multicenter trials have to be awaited for a final conclusion.",

A separate continued access study arm enrolled endovascular patients using the same inclusion/exclusion criteria. Both studies were designed for 2-year follow-up, and the pivotal endovascular patients had the option of extending the study follow-up through 5 years. All endovascular patients were stratified by physiologic risk into high-risk and standard-risk groups to assess overall mortality, rupture, conversion, endoleaks, secondary interventions, and sac enlargement. The entire endovascular cohort was pooled to assess device integrity, limb occlusion, component separation, and migration. The suboptimal endovascular result (SER) was established as an end point to assess late adverse outcomes.

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that mechanical failure of intraluminal thrombus (ILT) could play a key role in the rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), and in the present study, this hypothesis has been investigated. An in vitro experimental approach has been proposed, which provides layer-specific failure data of ILT tissue under static and pulsatile mechanical loads.\nIn total, 112 bone-shaped test specimens are prepared from luminal, medial, and abluminal layers of eight ILTs harvested during open elective AAA repair. Three different types of mechanical experiments, denoted as control test, ultimate strength test, and fatigue test were performed in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with fetal calf serum, L-ascorbic acid, and antibiotics at 37 degrees C and pH 7.0. In detail, fatigue tests, which are experiments, where the ILT tissue is loaded in pulsatile manner, were carried out at three different load levels with a natural frequency of 1.0 Hz.\nILT's ultimate strength (156.5 kPa, 92.0 kPa, and 47.7 kPa for luminal, medial, and abluminal layers, respectively) and referential stiffness (62.88 kPa, 47.52 kPa, and 41.52 kPa, for luminal, medial, and abluminal layers, respectively) continuously decrease from the inside to the outside. ILT tissue failed within less than 1 hour under pulsatile loading at a load level of 60% ultimate strength, while a load level of about 40% ultimate strength did not cause failure within 13.9 hours.\nILT tissue is vulnerable against fatigue failure and shows significant decreasing strength with respect to the number of load cycles. Hence, after a reasonable time of pulsating loading ILT's strength is far below its ultimate strength, and when compared with stress predictions from finite element (FE) studies, this indicates the likelihood of fatigue failure in vivo. Failure within the ILT could propagate towards the weakened vessel wall behind it and could initialize AAA failure thereafter.",

    "abstract": "Reliability of the most commonly used duplex ultrasound (DUS) velocity thresholds for internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis has been questioned since these thresholds were developed using less precise methods to grade stenosis severity based on angiography. In this study, maximum percent diameter carotid bulb ICA stenosis (European Carotid Surgery Trial [ECST] method) was objectively measured using high resolution B-mode DUS validated with computed tomography angiography (CTA) and used to determine optimum velocity thresholds for > or =50% and > or =80% bulb internal carotid artery stenosis (ICA).\nB-mode DUS and CTA images of 74 bulb ICA stenoses were compared to validate accuracy of the DUS measurements. In 337 mild, moderate, and severe bulb ICA stenoses (n = 232 patients), the minimal residual lumen and the maximum outer bulb/proximal ICA diameter were determined on longitudinal and transverse images. This in contrast to the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) method using normal distal ICA lumen diameter as the denominator. Severe calcified carotid segments and patients with contralateral occlusion were excluded. In each study, the highest peak systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic (EDV) velocities as well as ICA/common carotid artery (CCA) ratio were recorded. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the optimum threshold for each hemodynamic parameter was determined to predict > or =50% (n = 281) and > or =80% (n = 62) bulb ICA stenosis.\nPatients mean age was 74 +/- 8 years; 49% females. Clinical risk factors for atherosclerosis included coronary artery disease (40%), diabetes mellitus (32%), hypertension (70%), smoking (34%), and hypercholesterolemia (49%). Thirty-three percent of carotid lesions (n = 110) presented with ischemic cerebrovascular symptoms and 67% (n = 227) were asymptomatic. There was an excellent agreement between B-mode DUS and CTA (r = 0.9, P = .002). The inter/intraobserver agreement (kappa) for B-mode imaging measurements were 0.8 and 0.9, respectively, and for CTA measurements 0.8 and 0.9, respectively. When both PSV of > or =155 cm/s and ICA/CCA ratio of > or =2 were combined for the detection of > or =50% bulb ICA stenosis, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 97% and an accuracy of 82% were obtained. For a > or =80% bulb ICA stenosis, an EDV of > or =140 cm/s, a PSV of > or =370 cm/s and an ICA/CCA ratio of > or =6 had acceptable probability values.\nCompared with established velocity thresholds commonly applied in practice, a substantially higher PSV (155 vs 125 cm/s) was more accurate for detecting > or =50% bulb/ICA stenosis. In combination, a PSV of > or =155 cm/s and an ICA/CCA ratio of > or =2 have excellent predictive value for this stenosis category. For > or =80% bulb ICA stenosis (NASCET 60% stenosis), an EDV of 140 cm/s, a PSV of > or =370 cm/s, and an ICA/CCA ratio of > or =6 are equally reliable and do not indicate any major change from the established criteria. Current DUS > or =50% bulb ICA stenosis criteria appear to overestimate carotid bifurcation disease and may predispose patients with asymptomatic carotid disease to untoward costly diagnostic imaging and intervention.",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent development of endovascular therapy (EVT), a high incidence of restenosis remains as an unsolved issue in patients presenting with femoropopliteal lesions. We investigated whether cilostazol reduces restenosis after successful EVT for de novo femoropopliteal lesions.\nThis study was designed as a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point study in a single institution. Between March 2004 and June 2005, we randomized 127 patients who were successfully treated with EVT for de novo femoropopliteal lesions to receive cilostazol (200 mg/d, n = 63) or ticlopidine (200 mg/d, n = 64) in addition to aspirin (100 mg/d). Antiplatelet medications were started at least 1 week before EVT and were continued until the end of follow-up. Patency was defined by duplex ultrasound imaging with peak systolic velocity ratio >2.4.\nThere were no significant differences in the patients and lesion characteristics. Sixteen patients dropped out of the study protocol, six of whom were withdrawn due to adverse drug effects (cilostazol, n = 5; ticlopidine, n = 1; P = .09). Ten patients died (cilostazol, n = 4; ticlopidine, n = 6; P = .53) during the follow-up period. Patency rates at 12, 24, and 36 months were 87%, 82%, and 73% in the cilostazol group and 65%, 60%, and 51% in ticlopidine group by intention-to-treat analysis (P = .013) and were 87%, 82%, and 73% in the cilostazol group and 64%, 57%, and 48% in the ticlopidine group (P = .0088) by as-treated analysis. Freedom from target lesion revascularization and all adverse events (restenosis, amputation, and death) was significantly higher in cilostazol group than in ticlopidine group (P = .036, P = .031). No acute, subacute, or chronic thrombotic occlusion was encountered, and bleeding complication rates were similar between the two groups.\nCilostazol significantly reduces restenosis after EVT in femoropopliteal lesions.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the effect on neointimal hyperplasia of adenovirus-mediated delivery of cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) to the artery after balloon injury.\nSixty rabbits were randomized into three groups and underwent balloon injury in the left common carotid arteries. The injured arterial segment was isolated by two inflated balloon catheters. Saline or recombinant adenovirus expressing CREG or green fluorescent protein was injected into the lumen of the isolated arterial segments and incubated for 30 minutes. The rabbits were euthanized for immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and morphometric analysis at 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after balloon injury and in vivo gene transfer (5 rabbits for each time point). Common carotid artery angiography was performed before euthanasia.\nImmunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis demonstrated that CREG expression was significantly down-regulated in the acute phase of vascular injury and was gradually restored in the resolution phase. The changes of CREG expression were in parallel with those of the smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation markers SM alpha-actin and SM myosin heavy chain in the injured arteries. Adenovirus-mediated CREG transfer markedly increased CREG expression in the injured artery. Consequently, morphometric analysis revealed an approximate 50% reduction in the neointima and the intima/media ratio in CREG-transferred arteries compared with the saline and green fluorescent protein controls. Assay with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine showed that CREG transfer significantly inhibited SMC proliferation. In contrast, endothelialization of the injured artery was not affected by CREG transduction as assessed by CD31 immunostaining.\nThese data suggest that forced expression of CREG in the artery wall after acute vascular injury inhibits SMC proliferation, induces cellular differentiation, and attenuates neointimal hyperplasia. CREG delivery may have therapeutic potential for the prevention of restenosis after vascular angioplasty.",

    "abstract": "The mortality rate for renal artery bypass grafting (RABG) is reported to be 0% to 4% for patients with renovascular hypertension and 4% to 7% for patients with ischemic nephropathy. However, these data come from high-volume referral centers known for their expertise in treating these conditions. Because of the relative infrequency of these operations in most vascular surgery practices, the nationwide outcomes for RABG are not known. The purpose of this study was to define the operative mortality rate for RABG in the United States and to identify risk factors for perioperative mortality.\nThe National Inpatient Sample was analyzed to identify patients undergoing RABG for the years 2000 to 2004. Categoric data were analyzed using chi(2) and the Cochran-Armitage trend tests. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for perioperative mortality after RABG.\nDuring the study period, 6608 patients underwent RABG, representing a frequency of 3.51 operations per 100,000 discharges. More than two-thirds were performed at teaching hospitals (4564 vs 2,044; P < .0001). The frequency of RABG decreased by 30.7% between 2000 and 2004 (4.28 vs 2.96 RABGs per 100,000 discharges; P for trend < .0001). The in-hospital mortality for RABG was 10.0%. On univariate analysis, in-hospital mortality after RABG varied with increasing age, race, region of the country, and a preoperative history of chronic renal failure, congestive heart failure, or chronic lung disease. Logistic regression models identified advanced age (odds ratio [OR] 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-1.72], female gender (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02-1.41), and a history of chronic renal failure (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.75-2.78), congestive heart failure (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.44-2.62), or chronic lung disease (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.18-1.67) as independent markers of risk-adjusted, in-hospital mortality (P < .0001 for each of these five variables).\nNationwide in-hospital mortality after RABG is higher than predicted by prior reports from high-volume referral centers. Advanced age, female gender, and a history of chronic renal failure, congestive heart failure, or chronic lung disease were predictive of perioperative death. For the typical vascular practice, these data may provide a rationale for lower risk alternatives, such as renal artery stenting or referral to high-volume referral centers for RABG.",

    "abstract": "We postulated that ligation of a consistent perforating venous branch at the elbow would improve distention and flow in the superficial veins about the elbow. This would also lesson the likelihood of arterial steal enabling a favorable outcome following a brachial artery medial antecubital or cephalic vein arterio-venous fistula (AVF).\nPressure measurements were made from the radial artery after side-to-side brachial artery antecubital or cephalic vein AVF in 20 patients. Clamping of the perforating vein increased radial artery pressure significantly indicating that a considerable amount of flow from the side-to-side AVF was diverted into the deep system and away from the accessible superficial veins. Encouraged by this finding, we studied the outcome of brachial cephalic or brachial antecubital AVF with ligation of the deep branch in 134 patients who were not candidates for radio-cephalic AVF. The end point of the study was successful hemodialysis using the fistula.\nOf the 134 patients treated, 24 died, and 11 were lost to follow-up and were censored from analysis of fistula performance at that time point. The primary fistula success rate was 89.7% +/- 2.66% and 83.7% +/- 3.5% at 1 and 2 years by life table analysis. No patient developed significant arterial steal or venous hypertension.\nWe recommend this simple one-stage procedure for patients requiring hemodialysis whose cephalic vein at the wrist is unsuitable.",

Intima-media (I/M) and lumen-whole artery (L/A) area ratios, and luminal areas were measured. Serum lipid levels, liver enzymes, and kidney function were evaluated. Inflammatory cells were quantified and further verified with immunohistofluorescence staining. The extent of lipid deposition in the artery wall was quantified with Oil Red O (ORO) staining employing Zeiss AxioVision 4.6.3. Image analysis software. Lipid laden cells including macrophages were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).\nIntravenous IL18-BP 5 microg, 10 microg, and 25 microg significantly reduced I/M ratios compared with the control group at both 2 and 4 weeks. There was no significant difference between the 5 microg and 10 microg dose groups. However, at 10 microg, IL18-BP significantly increased L/A ratio more than either the 5 microg IL18-BP or control groups. The high fat diet caused significant elevation of serum lipids at 4 and 6 weeks. IL18-BP had no effect on blood lipid levels. Lipid deposit in the thoracic aorta of the control group at 6 weeks was more than at 4 weeks (P = .025). Administration of IL18-BP inhibited the lipid deposition at 4 weeks (not significant) and 6 weeks (P = .012 to .008) compared with its control group. Lipid laden macrophages (foam cells), as well as endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were seen in the descending thoracic aorta after 6 weeks of a high fat diet by ORO, immunohistofluorescence staining, and TEM. The lipid laden cells were not seen in either of IL18-BP groups. IL18-BP 10 microg significantly inhibited mono/macro adherence and infiltration in the SFA after balloon-injury at 2 weeks after surgery.\nA single intravenous dose of IL18-BP significantly decreased arterial neointimal hyperplasia, improved lumen to artery ratio after balloon-injury and also prevented arteriosclerosis progression.\nA single intravenous dose of IL18BP decreased neointimal hyperplasia and improved arterial L/A ratios in an atherosclerotic balloon-injury animal model. These preliminary results suggest that IL18BP may be a promising molecular approach to inhibit neointimal hyperplasia and arteriosclerosis progression following coronary and peripheral angioplasty.",

    "abstract": "Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is a percutaneous alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for treating patients with carotid artery stenosis. This study sought to evaluate whether patients at increased perioperative risk for CEA may be treated with CAS while maintaining equivalent outcomes.\nThis study was a nonblinded, retrospective analysis of data obtained from September 2002 to present in the CAS group and from January 1997 to present in the CEA group. Two hundred thirty-one CAS and 647 CEA procedures were performed. Patients were selected for CAS based on criteria that placed them at increased risk for standard CEA surgery. Except for percentage women treated, baseline demographics did not differ between patients treated with CAS and CEA: mean age (72.0 years [range 46-94] vs 70.5 years [range 42-92], P = NS), mean follow-up (12.8 +/- 11.8 months vs 8.7 +/- 10.0 months, P = NS) and percentage women treated (41.4% vs 32.3%, P = .03). Cerebral protection devices were used in 228/231 patients treated with CAS, and each patient underwent an NIH Stroke Scale assessment 24 hours postoperatively and at 30 days follow-up by an independent observer.\nPreoperative neurologic symptoms did not differ between patients treated with CAS and CEA: amaurosis fugax (6.06% vs 6.96%, P = NS), transient ischemic attacks (13.4% vs 13.9%, P = NS), strokes (19.9% vs 14.1%, P = NS) and total symptoms (27.7% vs 30.5%, P = NS). Due to the selection of patient groups based on predefined clinical characteristics, factors associated with an increased risk of complications from standard CEA surgery were generally more prevalent in patients treated with CAS: neck irradiation (6.06% vs 1.24%, P < .001), neck dissection for cancer therapy (7.8% vs 1.5%, P < .001), prior ipsilateral CEA (15.2% vs 3.4%, P </= .001), contralateral carotid artery occlusion (12.1% vs 1.1%, P < .001), modified Goldman Cardiac Risk II-moderate risk (26.0% vs 11.3%, P < .001) and modified Goldman Cardiac Risk III-high risk (16.4% vs 2.1%, P < .001) in patients treated with CAS and CEA, respectively. Perioperative outcomes did not differ between patients treated with CAS and CEA: myocardial infarction (MI) (1.7% vs 2.6%, P = NS), stroke without residual symptoms (1.3% vs 1.2%, P = NS), stroke with residual symptoms (0.4% vs 0.8%, P = NS), mortality (0.4% vs 0.6%, P = NS), and total MI/stroke/mortality rate (3.9% vs 5.3%, P = NS).\nThe data in this study demonstrate that high-risk patients undergoing CAS had comparable outcomes to low-risk patients undergoing CEA. This study supports the use of CAS as a reasonable alternative for patients at increased perioperative risk for CEA.",

    "abstract": "Patients with aortic dissection were studied to define (1) anatomic and physiologic derangements in renal artery blood flow, (2) differences in clinically suspected renal malperfusion and true functional malperfusion, and (3) variations in endovascular interventions for the treatment of renal malperfusion.\nThe cohort comprised 165 patients (mean age, 58 years) with dissections who were thought to have malperfusion sufficient to require arteriography. They were treated from 1996 to 2004 for acute (n = 115) or chronic (n = 50) aortic dissections (75 had type A, 90 had type B lesions). All patients had suspected peripheral vascular malperfusion (ie, cerebral, spinal, mesenteric, renal, or lower extremity vascular beds). Renal malperfusion was suspected in 88 patients secondary to worsening hypertension (n = 34), evolving renal insufficiency (n = 37), computed tomography evidence of impaired renal blood flow (n = 13), or a combination of factors (n = 4). Patients underwent angiographic and intravascular ultrasound studies. Renal malperfusion was confirmed with a systolic gradient between the aortic root and renal hilum (average, 44 mm Hg).\nRight renal arteries arose exclusively from the true lumen in 115 patients (70%), the false lumen in 11 (7%), and both lumens in 37 (23%). Left renal arteries arose exclusively from the true lumen in 69 patients (42%), the false lumen in 32 (20%), and both lumens in 62 (38%). Angiographic confirmation of malperfusion existed in 59 patients (67%) of the 88 suspected of such, and in 31 patients (39%) of the 79 with suspected malperfusion of nonrenal tissues. Of the 90 patients with confirmed renal malperfusion, 71 underwent endovascular therapy, including isolated renal artery stenting (n = 31), as well as proximal aortic fenestration with or without aortic stenting (n = 24), or both renal and aortic intervention (n = 16). Residual pressure gradients averaged 8.1 mm Hg after these interventions. Five procedure-related complications (7%) occurred. The periprocedural postintervention mortality rate was 21% (n = 15), including multisystem organ failure (n = 7), false lumen rupture (n = 3), reperfusion injury (n = 2), cerebral ischemia (n = 1), cardiac arrest (n = 1), and unknown (n = 1).\nPercutaneous aortic fenestration and renal artery stenting are both technically feasible and associated with an acceptable complication rate. Most patients respond well symptomatically, obviating the need for immediate surgical relief of renal artery obstruction and allowing for renal malperfusion recovery.",

    "abstract": "Major tissue loss caused by the critical limb ischemia requires improvement of distal perfusion and cover of large tissue defects. We propose a new method, the y-shaped subscapular artery flow-through (Y-SCAFT) muscle flap using the subscapular artery that yields an arterial graft and a free muscle flap sustained by a collateral branch of this artery. This prospective study evaluated the feasibility of this technique and analyzed wound healing, graft patency, and limb salvage.\nBetween 2002 and 2007, 20 patients, mean age 64 years (range, 55-79 years), were treated with this technique. All presented with critical ischemia and major tissue loss, with exposure of the tendons, bones, or joint, and were candidates for major amputation. Revascularization and cover of tissue loss with the same Y-SCAFT anatomic unit was used for all patients. The distal anastomosis was performed between the distal branch of the Y-SCAFT and the pedal artery in 9, posterior tibial artery in 4, peroneal artery in 1, lateral tarsal artery in 3, and the plantar artery in 3. In four patients, the distal part of the arterial graft, including the anastomosis, was covered with the muscle flap because the tissue loss was nearby. The proximal anastomosis was performed between a leg artery and the arterial graft in 10 patients. A venous graft was necessary in 10 patients to extend the bypass proximally.\nOne patient died during the postoperative period. Duplex control evidenced patency all the Y-SCAFT muscle flaps. Healing was achieved in all patients. Mean follow-up was 31 months (range, 6-58 months). No patients died during follow-up. One patient presented occlusion of the Y-SCAFT muscle flap and underwent amputated. One patient had major amputation despite a patent graft. At 2 years, leg salvage was 85%, patency was 94%, and survival was 94%. At the end of the follow-up, 17 patients (1 death, 2 amputations) had a patent graft, a viable muscle flap, wound healing, and a functional leg.\nWe showed the clinical feasibility of the technique of Y-SCAFT muscle flap, which allows for revascularization and cover of major tissue loss with one anatomic unit. This method is particularly useful in selected cases with poor run-off and large ischemic lesions.",

Indeed, vascular surgeons have placed a call to arms to ensure this takes place. Despite this fact, some wariness exists on the part of many vascular surgeons to initiate these strategies, functionally abnegating their responsibilities in this regard. The purpose of this article is to provide a simple reference to guide effective therapies for overall cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with peripheral arterial disease. Specific recommendations are made for tobacco cessation, lipid-lowering therapy, antiplatelet therapy, blood pressure control, and maintenance of normoglycemia.",

    "abstract": "Increased biomechanical stresses within the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) wall contribute to its rupture. Calcification and intraluminal thrombus can be commonly found in AAAs, but the relationship between calcification/intraluminal thrombus and AAA wall stress is not completely described.\nPatient-specific three-dimensional AAA geometries were reconstructed from computed tomographic images of 20 patients. Structural analysis was performed to calculate the wall stresses of the 20 AAA models and their altered models when calcification or intraluminal thrombus was not considered. A nonlinear large-strain finite element method was used to compute the wall stress distribution. The relationships between wall stresses and volumes of calcification and intraluminal thrombus were sought.\nMaximum stress was not correlated with the percentage of calcification, and was negatively correlated with the percentage of intraluminal thrombus (r = -0.56; P = .011). Exclusion of calcification from analysis led to a significant decrease in maximum stress by a median of 14% (range, 2%-27%; P < .01). When intraluminal thrombus was eliminated, maximum stress increased significantly by a median of 24% (range, 5%-43%; P < .01).\nThe presence of calcification increases AAA peak wall stress, suggesting that calcification decrease the biomechanical stability of AAA. In contrast, intraluminal thrombus reduces the maximum stress in AAA. Calcification and intraluminal thrombus should both be considered in the evaluation of wall stress for risk assessment of AAA rupture.",

    "abstract": "Compression stockings are widely applied after acute proximal deep vein thrombosis, but their efficacy in preventing the post-thrombotic syndrome remains controversial. This study assessed the effect of prolonged compression therapy after a standard treatment of 6 months after acute deep vein thrombosis.\nOf 900 patients screened, we randomly allocated 169 patients with a first or recurrent proximal deep vein thrombosis after receiving 6 months of standard treatment to wear compression stockings or not. Primary efficacy analysis was performed on the end point of emerging skin changes (C4-C6 according to the CEAP classification). Secondary analysis was done on symptoms associated with post-thrombotic syndrome. All analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle.\nThe primary end point occurred in 11 patients (13.1%) in the treatment group compared with 17 (20.0%) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-1.28; P = .19). Mean follow-up was 3.2 years and 2.9 years, respectively. Five additional patients in the control group required compression therapy owing to post-thrombotic signs and symptoms not included in the primary end point. No venous ulceration was observed in either group. Within subgroup analyses of the primary end point, we observed a large sex-specific difference between women (HR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.02-0.91) and men (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.42-2.73). Symptom relief was significant in favor of compression treatment during the first year but not thereafter.\nProlonged compression therapy after proximal deep vein thrombosis significantly reduces symptoms and may prevent post-thrombotic skin changes. Whether these findings translate to the prevention of advanced disease states with ulcerations remains unclear.",

Demographics, clinical morbidities, and Fontaine stage were recorded. The arterial tree was categorized into three groups: the aorta and iliac arteries (A-I); the common femoral, superficial femoral, and profunda femoral arteries (Fem); and the popliteal and tibial arteries (Pop-Tib). Arterial segments within groups were categorized as subcritical stenoses (patent or <50% stenoses), critical stenoses (single or multiple >50% stenoses), or occluded (segmental occlusions of any length). Patients with diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, and Fontaine stage (III vs IV) were analyzed for differing disease patterns according to their chart history.\nOcclusive disease was present in 5% in all arterial segments (A-I + Fem + Pop-Tib), in 1% in the A-I + Fem group, in 2% in the A-I + Pop-Tib group, in 3% in A-I group, in 4% in the Fem group, in 30% in the Fem + Pop-Tib group, and in 55% in the Pop-Tib group. Descriptive comparisons among subgroups demonstrated a 61% to 69% prevalence of popliteal and tibial occlusive patterns in patients with diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, and Fontaine stage IV. Furthermore, 65% of patients with Pop-Tib occlusions had associated critical stenoses in the proximal arterial groups.\nMore than half of critical limb ischemia patients undergoing infrainguinal revascularization have arterial occlusions in the popliteal or tibial arterial segments, or both, with associated critical stenoses in the femoral arterial segments, which is even greater in the subgroups with diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, and Fontaine stage IV. Knowledge of such occlusive patterns is important for the development of novel infrainguinal endovascular and angiogenesis therapies for critical limb ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Though the peroneal artery (PA) often remains patent despite disease or occlusion of other infrapopliteal arteries, there is skepticism about using the terminal PA as the outflow tract in distal revascularizations for limb salvage, especially when a patent inframalleolar artery is available. We analyzed our experience of using the distal PA and inframalleolar or pedal branches arteries as outflow tracts in revascularizations for critical limb ischemia.\nOver a decade, among 651 infrapopliteal arterial reconstructions performed in 597 patients, the PA was the outflow vessel in 214, its distal third being involved in 69 vein revascularizations (study group). During the same period, 187 vein bypass grafts were performed to 179 inframalleolar and 8 pedal branches arteries (control group). Patency, limb salvage and survival rates were assessed using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis. Complete follow-up (range, 0.1-10.2 years; mean, 5.8 years) was obtained in 245 (95.7%) patients (66 were in the study group).\nThe distal PA was chosen as the target vessel: (1) because the proximal, mid-PA was occluded or severely diseased and no other adequate inframalleolar or pedal branches arteries were identified preoperatively (n = 30; 43.5%); (2) because an alternative inframalleolar target vessel was present but severely diseased (n = 9; 13%); (3) because of the length limitations of the available vein (n = 12; 17.4%; or (4) because of the presence of invasive infection or necrosis overlying the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial arteries (n = 18; 26.1%). The study group was significantly younger than the control group (68 +/- 7 years vs 70 +/- 6 years, P = .039), and included significantly more patients with diabetes mellitus (65.2% vs 50.2%, P = .033) and insulin dependence (52.2% vs 37.9%, P = .041), dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (5.8% vs 1.1%, P = .047), and history of smoking (75.3% vs 58.2%, P = .012). None of the patients died in the perioperative period. Although the overall need for minor amputation was statistically higher in the PA group (78.2% vs 63.1%, P = .022), especially as concerns partial calcanectomy (8.7% vs 2.1%, P = .026), the proportion of wounds completely healed during the follow-up and the mean time to wound healing were comparable in the two groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed comparable long-term patency, limb salvage, and survival rates in the two groups.\nRevascularization to the distal third of the PA can achieve much the same outcome in terms of patency and limb salvage rates, wound healing rate and timing, as when other inframalleolar or pedal branches are used. The skepticism surrounding use of the terminal PA as an outflow vessel appears to be unwarranted.",

    "abstract": "Simulator-based endovascular skills training measurably improves performance in catheter-based image-guided interventions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether structured global performance assessment during endovascular simulation correlated well with trainee-reported procedural skill and prior experience level.\nFourth-year and fifth-year general surgery residents interviewing for vascular fellowship training provided detailed information regarding prior open vascular and endovascular operative experience. The pretest questionnaire responses were used to separate subjects into low (<20 cases) and moderate (20 to 100) endovascular experience groups. Subjects were then asked to perform a renal angioplasty/stent procedure on the Procedicus Vascular Intervention System Trainer (VIST) endovascular simulator (Mentice Corporation, Gothenburg, Sweden). The subjects' performance was supervised and evaluated by a blinded expert interventionalist using a structured global assessment scale based on angiography setup, target vessel catheterization, and the interventional procedure. Objective measures determined by the simulator were also collected for each subject. A postsimulation questionnaire was administered to determine the subjects' self-assessment of their performance.\nSeventeen surgical residents from 15 training programs completed questionnaires before and after the exercise and performed a renal angioplasty/stent procedure on the endovascular simulator. The beginner group (n = 8) reported prior experience of a median of eight endovascular cases (interquartile range [IQR], 6.5-17.8; range, 4-20), and intermediate group (n = 9) had previously completed a median of 42 cases (IQR, 31-44; range, 25-89, P = .01). The two groups had similar prior open vascular experience (79 cases vs 75, P = .60). The mean score on the structured global assessment scale for the low experience group was 2.68 of 5.0 possible compared with 3.60 for the intermediate group (P = .03). Scores for subcategories of the global assessment score for target vessel catheterization (P = .02) and the interventional procedure (P = .05) contributed more to the differentiation between the two experience groups. Total procedure time, fluoroscopy time, average contrast used, percentage of lesion covered by the stent, placement accuracy, residual stenosis rates, and number of cine loops utilized were similar between the two groups (P > .05).\nStructured endovascular skills assessment correlates well with prior procedural experience within a high-fidelity simulation environment. In addition to improving endovascular training, simulators may prove useful in determining procedural competency and credentialing standards for endovascular surgeons.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty has been used with increasing frequency in the treatment of infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the middle-term outcomes after crural angioplasty in patients with chronic critical limb ischemia and compare results with a meta-analysis of popliteal-to-distal vein bypass graft.\nData were retrieved from 30 articles published from 1990 through 2006 (63% of articles published between 2000 and 2006). All studies used survival analysis, reported a 12-month cumulative rate of patency or limb salvage, and included at least 15 infrapopliteal angioplasties. The outcome measures were immediate technical success, primary and secondary patency, limb salvage, and patient survival. Data from life-tables, survival curves, and texts were used.\nThe pooled estimate of success was 89.0% +/- 2.2% for immediate technical result. Results at 1 and 36 months were 77.4% +/- 4.1% and 48.6% +/- 8.0% for primary patency, 83.3% +/- 1.4% and 62.9% +/- 11.0% for secondary patency, 93.4% +/- 2.3% and 82.4% +/- 3.4% for limb salvage, and 98.3% +/- 0.7% and 68.4% +/- 5.5% for patient survival, respectively. Studies with >75% of the limbs with tissue loss fared worse than their respective comparative subgroup for technical success and patency but not for limb salvage or survival. No publication bias was detected.\nThe technical success and subsequent durability of crural angioplasty are limited compared with bypass surgery, but the clinical benefit is acceptable because limb salvage rates are equivalent to bypass surgery.

    "abstract": "A recent randomized trial suggested nitinol self-expanding stents (SES) were associated with reduced restenosis rates compared with simple percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). We evaluated our results with superficial femoral artery (SFA) SES to determine whether TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus (TASC) classification, indication for intervention, patient risk factors, or Society of Vascular Surgery (SVS) runoff score correlated with patency and clinical outcome, and to evaluate if bare nitinol stents or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) covered stent placement adversely impacts the tibial artery runoff.\nA total of 109 consecutive SFA stenting procedures (95 patients) at two university-affiliated hospitals from 2003 to 2006 were identified. Medical records, angiographic, and noninvasive studies were reviewed in detail. Patient demographics and risk factors were recorded. Procedural angiograms were classified according to TASC Criteria (I-2000 and II-2007 versions) and SVS runoff scores were determined in every patient; primary, primary-assisted, secondary patency, and limb salvage rates were calculated. Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine if indication, TASC classification, runoff score, and comorbidities affected outcome.\nSeventy-one patients (65%) underwent SES for claudication and 38 patients (35%) for critical limb ischemia (CLI). Average treatment length was 15.7 cm, average runoff score was 4.6. Overall 36-month primary, primary-assisted, and secondary rates were 52%, 64%, and 59%, respectively. Limb salvage was 75% in CLI patients. No limbs were lost following interventions in claudicants (mean follow-up 16 months). In 24 patients with stent occlusion, 15 underwent endovascular revision, only five (33%) ultimately remained patent (15.8 months after reintervention). In contrast, all nine reinterventions for in-stent stenosis remained patent (17.8 months). Of 24 patients who underwent 37 endovascular revisions for either occlusion or stenosis, eight (35%) had worsening of their runoff score (4.1 to 6.4). By Cox proportional hazards analysis, hypertension (hazard ratio [HR] 0.35), TASC D lesions (HR 5.5), and runoff score > 5 (HR 2.6) significantly affected primary patency.\nSelf-expanding stents produce acceptable outcomes for treatment of SFA disease. Poorer patency rates are associated with TASC D lesions and poor initial runoff score; HTN was associated with improved patency rates. Stent occlusion and in-stent stenosis were not entirely benign; one-third of patients had deterioration of their tibial artery runoff. Future studies of SFA interventions need to stratify TASC classification and runoff score. Further evaluation of the long-term effects of SFA stenting on tibial runoff is needed.",

    "abstract": "The optimal treatment for hemodynamically significant infrainguinal vein bypass graft stenosis is not known. This study compares three options as first choice for the revision of failing infrainguinal vein grafts: cutting balloon angioplasty (CBA), standard percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA), and open surgical revision (OS).\nInfrainguinal vein bypass graft lesions treated in a single institution during a 12-year period were evaluated. Of these, 161 lesions in 124 infrainguinal bypasses (101 patients) were treated with OS (n = 42), PTA (n = 57), or CBA (n = 62). The initial indication for the bypass in these patients was limb salvage in 73% and claudication in 27%. The primary outcome of interest was the development of vein graft occlusion or significant stenosis (>or=70%) as detected by surveillance duplex ultrasound scanning or arteriography some time after repair.\nThe stenosis-free patency rates at 48 months for OS, CBA, and PTA were 74%, 62%, and 34%, respectively. PTA was associated with an increased risk of treatment failure compared with both OS (hazard ratio [HR], 3.9; P < .0001) and CBA (HR, 3.1; P < .0001). There was no significant difference between OS and CBA (HR, 1.3 for CBA vs OS, P = .6). Pseudoaneurysms developed in two CBA patients. One ruptured and required interposition graft, and one was monitored.\nCutting balloon angioplasty is a reasonable, initial treatment for infrainguinal vein graft stenosis in most patients. It is a safe, minimally invasive, outpatient procedure with patency rates that are comparable to OS and superior to PTA.",

    "abstract": "Thrombosis in unusual locations in the lower extremity veins has not been assessed. These veins are not imaged routinely and therefore information about them is lacking.\nThis study was designed to evaluate the natural history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in unusual sites. Patients with DVT in all thigh veins but the femoral vein were included. Patients with thrombi in any other vein in the first examination and those with history of DVT were excluded. Duplex ultrasound (DU) examination was performed to exclude thrombosis in the lower extremity in patients with signs and symptoms of venous thromboembolism and also in high-risk, asymptomatic patients. All veins from the distal external iliac vein to the lower calf were imaged. The deep femoral, femoropopliteal, lateral thigh, sciatic, and muscular thigh veins were examined. These patients were followed at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and yearly thereafter, for thrombus propagation, resolution, and reflux.\nAmong the 15,850 DU performed in the vascular laboratory at Loyola University Medical Center, in a 10-year period to rule out DVT, 2568 (16.2%) were positive and 14 cases (7 males, 0.54% among the patients with DVT and 0.088% among the entire population) involved thromboses in unusual locations. Ten cases involved the left lower extremity and four the right. The unusual DVT cases were associated with medical and surgical conditions or were idiopathic in 11 patients, whereas three had Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS). The veins involved in the first group of patients were the deep femoral (8), the femoropopliteal (2), and the deep external pudendal (1). The patients with KTS had involvement of muscular thigh veins (1), and the lateral thigh vein and the sciatic vein (2). Thrombi propagation with extension to the common femoral vein was seen in four of the 14 patients: two from the deep femoral vein, one from the femoropopliteal vein, and one from the deep external pudendal vein. There were two incidences of pulmonary embolism (PE) one of which was fatal. At final follow-up, two patients developed recurrent DVT and nine had signs and symptoms of chronic venous disease.\nThe involvement of the studied veins in DVT is extremely rare. Thrombosis in these veins can follow the natural course of thrombosis in the more usual locations and is associated with lethal incidences of PE. Therefore, the association of these veins with all the grave sequelae of thromboembolic disease suggests that inclusion of these veins in routine lower extremity duplex scans would be beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Bone marrow-derived cells are recruited into the thrombus during resolution. This study explored whether mobilization of bone marrow cells with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) could enhance the resolution of venous thrombi and the accumulation of macrophages in thrombi and explored the effect of rhG-CSF on cysteine-cysteine chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) expression.\nThe Sprague-Dawley adult rats were randomly divided into four groups: control, sham-operated, thrombus, and treatment groups. Thrombi were induced in the thrombus and treatment group, which received a subcutaneous injection of rhG-CSF once daily for 6 days postoperatively. The thrombus, sham-operated, and control groups received equal volumes of 0.9% saline. The mononuclear cells in peripheral blood were analyzed by an automated hematology analyzer and counted under microscope. The cell marker CD68 was used to determine the number of macrophages in thrombi tissue sections. Levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP1alpha) in the peripheral blood were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to analyze, respectively, the expression of CCR2 messenger RNA in the peripheral blood and CCR2 protein of THP-1 monocyte.\nAt postoperative days 3 (P < .05) and 7 (P < .01), mononuclear cells significantly increased in treatment group (2.1 +/- 0.3, 4.4 +/- 0.3 x 10(6)/L) vs the thrombus group (1.7 +/- 0.2, 1.3 +/- 0.4 x 10(6)/L). The organization and recanalization of thrombi in treatment group progressed more quickly compared with the thrombus group (P < .01). The macrophage number of the thrombus in the treatment group (338 +/- 26 cells/15 high-power fields) increased significantly vs the thrombus group (125 +/- 11 cells/15 high-power fields, P < .01). No statistical difference was observed between the thrombus and treatment group in the MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha level in peripheral blood. Expressions of the CCR2 gene in the peripheral blood of the treatment group significantly increased compared with the thrombus group (P < .05). Recombinant human G-CSF induced higher expression of CCR2 protein of human monocytic cell line THP-1.\nBone marrow mobilization enhanced the resolution and recanalization of venous thrombi. This process was associated with increased macrophage accumulation in thrombi, which might be the result of higher CCR2 expression of monocytes.\nThe classic treatment of venous thrombi is anticoagulation. Anticoagulant therapy and thrombolysis both have limited effects on existing thrombi and have a small but significant risk of severe hemorrhage. In clinical practice, we lack specific treatment for patients with venous thrombosis combined with brain hemorrhage or a gastrointestinal activated ulcer, which are contraindicated for anticoagulation and thrombolytic therapy. Enhancing the resolution of venous thrombi would contribute to its therapy. Bone marrow-derived cells are recruited into the thrombus during resolution. Many of these cells express a macrophage phenotype and may represent a population of plastic stem cells that orchestrate thrombus recanalization. Recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) can mobilize monocytic lineage cells into peripheral blood and may contribute to this cell in the thrombi. If rhG-CSF enhances the resolution of venous thrombi and recanalization, it might be used to treat patients with venous thrombi, especially those who have contraindication for anticoagulation and thrombolytic therapy.",

    "abstract": "Neovascularization at the saphenofemoral junction is one of the principal causes of recurrent varicose veins after great saphenous vein surgery. Because angiogenic stimulation from the exposed endothelium of the great saphenous vein stump is considered an important trigger for this process, we hypothesized that complete resection of the stump with endothelial inversion might lessen grade 2 groin neovascularization and thereby decrease recurrence of thigh varicosities.\nTwo groups of consecutive patients with primary varicose veins of the great saphenous vein were studied. Group A was a historical control group of 70 limbs (48 patients) in which conventional flush ligation was performed at the level of the saphenofemoral junction. Group B was a prospectively studied clinical trial cohort of 65 limbs (45 patients), wherein the great saphenous vein stump was completely resected using a side-biting clamp to isolate the saphenofemoral junction, and the resulting common femoral vein venotomy was closed with a running inverting suture. Early postoperative follow-up was performed at 6 weeks. Clinical examinations and duplex ultrasound scans were performed after 2 years of follow-up. Grade 2 groin neovascularization was defined by the presence of >3 mm tortuous new refluxing veins, typically communicating with recurrent varicosities in the thigh.\nAfter 2 years, recurrent varicose veins were present in the thighs of 13 of 65 limbs (20%) in group A and in 22 of 61 limbs (36%) of group B (P = .049). Grade 2 neovascularization was present at the saphenofemoral junction in six of 65 limbs (9%) of group A and in 12 of 61 limbs (20%) of group B (P = .127).\nComplete resection of the great saphenous vein stump and inversion suturing of the common femoral vein venotomy, instead of simple flush ligation at the level of the saphenofemoral junction, do not appear to decrease grade 2 neovascularization and related thigh varicosity recurrence after great saphenous vein stripping for primary varicose veins.",

    "abstract": "Given improvements in care for peripheral vascular disease and diabetes over the last two decades, it was of interest whether racial disparities in lower extremity amputation rates had changed.\nHospital data for 18 years (1987-2004) were used to compute above, below, and through foot amputation rates for over eight million people living in the Chicago metropolitan area. Three areas were created from zip code level census data. Differences in amputation rates were compared between residents of zip code areas that were >50% African American, 10% to 50% African American, or <10% African American.\nThe largely African American area of the South and West sides of Chicago, with less than 15% of the area population, accounted for 27% of all amputation discharges (n = 33,775) over the 18 years. For all residents of northern Illinois, major (above and below knee) amputation rates declined to 17 per 100,000 residents over the last decade, and both inpatient mortality and length of stay fell throughout the period. However, residents of largely African American zip codes had over five times higher per capita amputation rates than residents of primarily white zip codes.\nRacial disparities have remained remarkably constant, despite progress in reducing the overall major amputation rate in northern Illinois. Addressing these disparities will require that low income, medically complex patients at risk of limb loss receive timelier, high performance care, combined with community-based public health and preventive medicine interventions that address the social determinants of health.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is an increasingly popular treatment option for patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), although open repair is considered the standard by virtue of its durability. Octogenarians, as a subgroup, may stand to benefit the most by EVAR. The purpose of this study is to review operative results and durability of open AAA repair and EVAR in octogenarians.\nFrom May 1996 to August 2006, 150 patients aged >or=80 years underwent elective repair of their infrarenal AAA. Eighty-one underwent EVAR and 69 had open repair. Demographic data, aneurysm specifics, comorbidities, operative morbidity and mortality, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, and late outcomes were analyzed.\nIn the EVAR group, 27 of 81 (33%) patients died during a mean follow-up of 25 months. In the open repair group, 34 of 69 (49%) patients died during a mean follow-up of 43 months. The median survival time for EVAR was 350 weeks (range, 145-404 weeks) compared with 317 weeks (range, 233-342 weeks) for the open repair group. A Kaplan-Meier log-rank analysis showed no difference in early or long-term survival between EVAR and open repair (P = .13). EVAR was associated with decreased blood loss, decreased length of intensive care unit and hospital stays, and a greater number of patients discharged to home.\nEVAR and open repair are comparable in safety and efficacy in octogenarians. Operative repair outcomes remain acceptable. Mid- and long-term survival are similar, indicating no survival advantage of one procedure compared with the other.",

    "abstract": "Increased blood flow causes neointimal atrophy, whereas relief of wall tension with an external wrap causes arterial medial atrophy. To study the effects of blood flow and wall tension separately and together, we applied tight or loose wraps on high-flow or normal-flow iliac arteries in baboons.\nBaboon external iliac arteries were wrapped with loose-fitting and tight-fitting expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), leaving part unwrapped. A downstream arteriovenous fistula was constructed on one side to increase blood flow approximately twofold. The arteries were perfusion-fixed with 10% formalin after 4 (n = 5) and 28 days (n = 5).\nAt 4 days, compared with the unwrapped artery, the loosely and tightly wrapped normal-flow artery showed significant medial atrophy (23% and 30%, respectively; P < .05). The tightly wrapped artery showed a loss of cells (27%; P = .02) but no change in cell density. At 28 days, the medial cross-sectional area was decreased by the tight wrap and loose wrap under normal (45% and 28%, respectively; P < .05) and high (43% and 29%, respectively; P < .05) flow. High flow did not alter the effect of wrapping nor did it affect the unwrapped medial area. At 28 days, the normal and high flow tightly wrapped media showed an insignificant loss of cells but had increased cell density (47% and 30%, respectively; P < .05), suggesting preferential loss of extracellular matrix. Decorin was expressed at the late time only in the tightly wrapped normal and high-flow media and was associated with tight packing of the collagen, as detected by picrosirius red staining.\nLoose-fitting and tight-fitting ePTFE wraps induced an inflammatory foreign body response that caused medial atrophy with loss of cells and extracellular matrix; the tight wrap was more effective. High blood flow did not prevent or augment medial atrophy.\nResearch in arterial restenosis has focused on the biologic mechanisms and pharmacologic approaches to the prevention of intimal hyperplasia. An alternative therapeutic approach might be to induce atrophy of established intimal hyperplasia. We have previously reported that high blood flow induces neointimal regression in expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in baboons. Here we provide another model of vascular atrophy induced by external wrapping. The similarity between baboons and humans in their vascular systems and individual genetic heterogeneity makes these experiments of great relevance. Up- or down-regulated genes common to both models might be key regulators of vascular atrophy and therefore suitable therapeutic targets for pharmacologic treatment of established lesions.",

    "abstract": "Report the results of a phase II multicenter, prospective trial comparing endovascular treatment of descending thoracic aneurysm (TEVAR) with the TAG device to surgical controls after 5 years of follow-up.\nThe Gore TAG trial compared the TAG endograft patients (n = 140) with standard open surgical controls (n = 94) with enrollment from September of 1999 to May of 2001. An additional 51 patients were enrolled in 2003 after revision of the endograft. Follow-up consisted of patient visits, computed tomography (CT) scans and x-rays at 1, 6, and 12 months and yearly. Significant sac size change was defined as >or=5 mm increase or decrease from the 1 month baseline measurement. Migration was defined as >or=10 mm cranial or caudal movement of the device inside the aorta. Significance was determined as P <or= .05.\nAt 5 years, aneurysm-related mortality was lower for TAG patients at 2.8% compared with open controls at 11.7% (P = .008). No differences in all-cause mortality were noted, with 68% of TAG patients and 67% of open controls surviving to 5 years (P = .43). Major adverse events at 5 years were significantly reduced in the TAG group; 57.9% vs 78.7% (P = .001). Endoleaks in the TAG group decreased from 8.1% at 1 month to 4.3% at 5 years. Five TAG patients have undergone major aneurysm-related re-interventions at 5 years (3.6%), including one arch aneurysm repair for type 1 endoleak and migration, one open conversion and five endovascular procedures for endoleaks in three patients. There were fewer secondary procedures not directly related to aneurysm repair in the TAG vs the open repair group at 5 years, 15.0% vs 31.9%, (P = .01). For TAG patients, sac size at 60 months decreased in 50% and increased in 19% compared with the 1-month baseline. Comparison with the modified low-porosity device at 24 months showed sac increase in 12.9% of original vs 2.9% in modified grafts (P = .11). At 5 years, there have been no ruptures, one migration, no collapse, and 20 instances of fracture in 19 patients, all before the revision of the TAG graft.\nIn anatomically suitable patients, TAG treatment of thoracic aneurysms is superior to surgical repair at 5 years. Although sac enlargement is concerning, early modified device results indicate this issue may be resolved.",

    "results": "At 5 years, aneurysm-related mortality was lower for TAG patients at 2.8% compared with open controls at 11.7% (P = .008). No differences in all-cause mortality were noted, with 68% of TAG patients and 67% of open controls surviving to 5 years (P = .43). Major adverse events at 5 years were significantly reduced in the TAG group; 57.9% vs 78.7% (P = .001). Endoleaks in the TAG group decreased from 8.1% at 1 month to 4.3% at 5 years. Five TAG patients have undergone major aneurysm-related re-interventions at 5 years (3.6%), including one arch aneurysm repair for type 1 endoleak and migration, one open conversion and five endovascular procedures for endoleaks in three patients. There were fewer secondary procedures not directly related to aneurysm repair in the TAG vs the open repair group at 5 years, 15.0% vs 31.9%, (P = .01). For TAG patients, sac size at 60 months decreased in 50% and increased in 19% compared with the 1-month baseline. Comparison with the modified low-porosity device at 24 months showed sac increase in 12.9% of original vs 2.9% in modified grafts (P = .11). At 5 years, there have been no ruptures, one migration, no collapse, and 20 instances of fracture in 19 patients, all before the revision of the TAG graft.",

    "abstract": "Naturally occurring heparin-like activity in the form of endogenous heparin and heparin sulfate proteoglycans has been shown in normal human plasma. Exogenous low-dose heparin improves pain-free walking distance and maximum walking distance in peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). Is reduced endogenous heparin activity responsible for some of the problems found in PAOD? This study compared heparin-like activity in patients with PAOD with that in healthy subjects and explored its relationship to disease severity.\nIn part 1, native and heparinase-modified thromboelastography was performed on peripheral venous blood samples in three groups of patients to measure heparin-like anticoagulant activity. Group 1: 15 control subjects (median age, 60 years; range, 49-74 years; ankle-brachial pressure index [ABPI] >0.9); group 2: 14 patients with intermittent claudication (median age, 66 years; range, 56-80; ABPI, 0.69 [SD, 0.09]); group 3: 14 patients with rest pain (median age, 67.5 years; range, 54-84 years; ABPI, 0.45 [SD, 0.08]). In part 2, heparin equivalent to that in normal plasma was added to blood samples from 15 patients with short-distance claudication (n = 4) or rest pain (n = 11), and baseline (without heparinase) thromboelastography was performed to exclude lack of antithrombin as a cause of diminished heparin-like activity.\nIn part 1, all patients with PAOD had a significant increase in coagulability compared with controls. Heparinase-modified thromboelastography in controls showed a significant decrease in the latent period between placing the sample in the analyser, where it is recalcified, to the initial fibrin formation (DeltaR time; P = .002) compared with native TEG, confirming endogenous heparin-like activity. Using DeltaR time as a measure of heparin-like activity, a significant reduction was found in patients with claudication (0.33 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.004-0.65; P = .02) and in those with rest pain (0.25 minutes; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.52; P = .02) compared with that in controls (0.78 minutes; 95% CI, 0.39-1.16). The DeltaR time also correlated with the ABPI (r = 0.35, P = .02), suggesting declining heparin-like activity with increasing ischemia. In part 2, exogenous heparin restored the thromboelastography in PAOD patients to normal, suggesting that lack of endogenous heparin-like compounds rather than reduced antithrombin levels was responsible for changes in coagulation.\nPatients with PAOD have reduced endogenous heparin-like activity that correlates with disease severity.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous access during endovascular aortic repair has been shown to be feasible and safe using a suture-mediated closure device (\"Preclose\" technique) for closure of up to 24F introducer sheaths. The purpose of this study is to examine the late outcomes of those femoral arteries repaired in this manner.\nThe Preclose technique has been previously described. Briefly, the technique involves two Perclose Proglide devices deployed in the femoral artery prior to insertion of the large diameter introducer sheath and then closure of the arteriotomy by tying down knots of the Proglide following removal of the sheath. The medical records of all patients who underwent endovascular aortic repairs using the Preclose technique between December 2004 and August 2007 were reviewed. Follow-up protocol consisted of computed tomography (CT) angiograms performed at 1, 6, and 12 months, and annually thereafter. All Preclose patients who had at least a 6-month postoperative scan were included in the study. For each patient, the most recent postoperative scan was compared with the preoperative scan for evidence of any new anatomic abnormalities of the femoral artery such as dissection, stenosis, or pseudoaneurysm. Three-dimensional post processing with multiplanar reconstructions was also performed as necessary to confirm axial scan findings.\nA total of 292 patients underwent percutaneous endovascular aortic repairs (TEVAR-125, EVAR-167). Four hundred thirty-two femoral arteries were closed with 870 devices. Four hundred eighteen vessels were approximated with two devices, while 30 arteries required three devices for hemostasis and an additional four vessels only required a single device. Two hundred seventy-eight (64.3%) vessels were accessed with sheaths 18 to 24F. Four hundred eight femoral arteries (94.4%) were closed successfully with the Preclose technique. There were 100 patients (TEVAR-35, EVAR-65) who had adequate postoperative CT scan at 6-months or later. The mean follow up was 11.6 +/- 5.0 months. Of the 156 femoral arteries in these 100 patients repaired using the Preclose technique, there were 3 late complications in 3 patients, 1 asymptomatic femoral artery dissection, and 2 femoral artery pseudoaneurysms requiring surgical repair, resulting in a late complication rate of 1.92% (3/156).\nPercutaneous closure of femoral arteries after large diameter introducer sheaths using the Preclose technique has a low incidence of early and late complications related to the closure site.",

    "abstract": "This study retrospectively evaluated the technical and hemostatic outcomes of reconstructive and deconstructive endovascular management in patients with head and neck cancers associated with carotid blowout syndrome (CBS).\nTwenty-four patients with head and neck cancers with CBS involving the main trunk of carotid artery underwent endovascular therapy. This included reconstructive management with self-expandable stent grafts to preserve the diseased carotid artery in 11 patients and deconstructive management with balloons, coils, or acrylic adhesives to occlude the diseased carotid artery in 13 patients. Based on clinical severity and therapeutic priority, we classified CBS in our patients into two groups: acute or impending and threatened. The angiographic severity was graded from 0 to 3. Evaluation of technical outcome included technical success, initial and delayed complications, and patency of stent graft in the reconstructive group. The hemostatic outcome was evaluated by immediate hemostatic result, rebleeding, and duration of hemostasis. Sex, age, clinical and angiographic severities, local wound complications, and location of the pathologic lesion were examined as predictors of the technical and hemostatic outcomes of endovascular management by using Cox regression method.\nTechnical success and immediate hemostasis were achieved in all patients of both groups. Initial complications during the procedures were encountered in four patients (36.4%) who underwent reconstructive management and in one patient (7.7%) who underwent deconstructive management (P = .142). Delayed complications during the follow-up were seen in one patient (9.1%) with reconstructive management and one patient (7.7%) with deconstructive management (P > .99). Rebleeding occurred in five patients (45.5%) in the reconstructive management group and in three patients (23.1%) in the deconstructive management group (P = .659). The mean duration of hemostasis after initial reconstructive and deconstructive management was 4.0 +/- 8.1 and 8.5 +/- 10.1 months, respectively (P = .249). Rebleeding was noted in 7 of 11 patients (63.6%) with acute CBS and in 1 of 13 patients (7.7%) with impending and threatened CBS (P = .008).\nThere is no significant difference in technical and hemostatic outcomes between the reconstructive and deconstructive endovascular management methods. Hemostatic results were influenced by clinical severity. The rebleeding rate is higher in patients with advanced and acute clinical severity.",

    "abstract": "Management of lower extremity arterial disease with endovascular intervention is on the rise. Current practice patterns vary widely across and within specialty practices that perform endovascular intervention. This study evaluated reimbursement and costs of different approaches for offering endovascular intervention and identified strategies to improve cost-efficiency.\nThe medical records of all patients admitted to a university health system during 2005 for an endovascular intervention were retrospectively reviewed. Procedure type, setting, admission status, and financial data were recorded. Groups were compared using analysis of variance, Student t test for independent samples, and chi2.\nA total of 296 endovascular interventions were completed, and 184 (62%) met inclusion criteria. Atherectomy and stenting were significantly more costly when performed in the operating room than in the radiology suite: atherectomy, dollars 6596 vs dollars 4867 (P = .002); stent, dollars 5884 vs dollars 3292, (P < .001); angioplasty, dollars 2251 vs dollars 1881 (P = .46). Reimbursement was significantly higher for inpatient vs ambulatory admissions (P < .001). Costs were lowest when the endovascular intervention was done in the radiology suite on an ambulatory basis and highest when done as an inpatient in the operating room (dollars 5714 vs dollars 12,278; P < .001). Contribution margins were significantly higher for inpatients. Net profit was appreciated only for interventions done as an inpatient in the radiology suite. Reimbursement, contribution margins, and net profit were significantly lower among private pay patients in both the ambulatory and inpatient setting. The 30-day hospital readmission after ambulatory procedures was seven patients (6%).\nPractice patterns for endovascular interventions differ considerably. Costs vary by procedure and setting, and reimbursement depends on admission status and accurate documentation; these dynamics affect affordability. Organizing vascular services within a hub will ensure that care is delivered in the most cost-efficient manner. Guidelines may include designating the radiology suite as the primary venue for endovascular interventions because it is less costly than the operating room. Selective stenting policies should be considered. Contracts with private insurers must include carve-outs for stent costs and commensurate reimbursement for ambulatory procedures, and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT; American Medical Association, Chicago, Ill) coding must be proficient to make ambulatory endovascular interventions fiscally acceptable.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of stent grafts in the treatment of thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\nOur health technology assessment method combined a critical review of the literature with experts' opinions. Several databases, useful Web sites, and the gray literature were searched from January 1995 to December 2004. Some manually retrieved major articles published in 2005 were also included. The draft report was submitted to and discussed by a working group of 12 members nominated by relevant medical societies. The amended report was submitted to a multidisciplinary group of 12 peer reviewers for comment.\nEndovascular stent grafting (ESG) repair for lesions of the thoracic aorta, including aneurysms, dissections, and aortic isthmus ruptures, is probably beneficial in terms of operative mortality and severe morbidity, with an incidence of paraplegia of 2.1% (range 0%-7%) for ESG vs 5% (range, 3%-15%) for surgery, provided that there is a rigorous medium-term assessment and that anatomic factors are favorable. A proximal neck length of at least 2 cm is needed to insert the stent graft. Indications for ESG in thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection are similar to those for surgery. Endovascular stent grafting is particularly appropriate in patients with multiple traumas to the thoracic aorta in whom concomitant lesions are a contraindication to open surgery. Endovascular stent graft repair can only be done in public or private centers with expertise in both endovascular and surgical procedures and with adequate technical facilities. Patients should be informed of the advantages and drawbacks of both methods. A multidisciplinary discussion should address risks of converting to open surgery and possible need for a cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients should be monitored annually by computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging and plain radiographs because long-term results are uncertain (possible stent graft deterioration, onset of aortic disease). They should be told of the need for surveillance and possible further treatment.\nA prospective registry of all thoracic aorta procedures (endovascular treatment, open surgery, thoracic ESG plus extra-anatomic bypass) needs to be set up. All practitioners and stent graft manufacturers should contribute to this registry. It should include information on patient monitoring in order to (1) select patients who could be treated by ESG repair, (2) assess the feasibility of a randomized controlled study comparing ESG and surgery, (3) assess the medium-term outcome of different devices, and (4) obtain a better understanding of the health economics aspects.",

A proximal neck length of at least 2 cm is needed to insert the stent graft. Indications for ESG in thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection are similar to those for surgery. Endovascular stent grafting is particularly appropriate in patients with multiple traumas to the thoracic aorta in whom concomitant lesions are a contraindication to open surgery. Endovascular stent graft repair can only be done in public or private centers with expertise in both endovascular and surgical procedures and with adequate technical facilities. Patients should be informed of the advantages and drawbacks of both methods. A multidisciplinary discussion should address risks of converting to open surgery and possible need for a cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients should be monitored annually by computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging and plain radiographs because long-term results are uncertain (possible stent graft deterioration, onset of aortic disease). They should be told of the need for surveillance and possible further treatment.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular stenting has emerged as an alternative to open repair in patients requiring surgery for thoracic aortic pathology. A number of comparative series have been published but, to date, there has been no meta-analysis comparing outcomes following stenting as opposed to open surgery.\nElectronic abstract databases and conference proceedings were searched to identify relevant series. Pooled odds ratios were calculated using random effects models for perioperative mortality, neurological injury, and major reintervention.\nThe search identified 17 eligible series, totaling 1109 patients (538 stenting). Stenting was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (pooled odds ratio 0.36; 95% CI 0.228-0.578; P < .0001) and major neurological injury (pooled odds ratio 0.39; 95% CI 0.25-0.62; P = .0001). There was no difference in the major reintervention rate (pooled odds ratio 0.91; 95% CI 0.610-1.619). There was a reduction in hospital and critical care stay although there was evidence of heterogeneity and bias with respect to these outcomes. Subgroup analyses suggested that endovascular repair reduced mortality (pooled odds ratio 0.25; 95% CI 0.09-0.66) and neurological morbidity (pooled odds ratio 0.28; 95% CI 0.13-0.61) in stable patients undergoing repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms. There was no effect on mortality in patients with thoracic aortic trauma but neurological injury was reduced (pooled odds ratio 0.17; 95% CI 0.03-1.03). Endovascular repair did not confer any apparent benefit over open surgery in patients with thoracic aortic rupture.\nEndovascular thoracic aortic repair reduces perioperative mortality and neurological morbidity in patients with descending thoracic aortic aneurysms. There may be less benefit in other thoracic aortic conditions.",

In most cases, aortic perforation was recognized and managed within 18 months of the spine surgery. Clinical presentation included acute bleeding, necessitating urgent exploration in two patients, and pseudoaneurysm formation in five cases, two of which were infected. Depending on the extent of aortic damage and the presence or absence of infection, management ranged from endovascular grafting, to screw burring with closure of the perforation site, to aortic reconstruction with a tube graft and complete orthopedic hardware removal. Outcome was favorable in all patients who were operated on.\nThe small number of reported cases indicates either the rarity of this complication or unawareness of its existence. The true incidence of this complication is probably under-reported. Orthopedic and vascular surgeons should be aware of this potentially fatal problem. Prevention remains the best treatment. Once encountered, a variety of techniques are available to manage this complication with reasonable outcome.",

    "abstract": "To determine if insurance status predicts severity of vascular disease at the time of treatment or outcomes following intervention.\nHospital discharge databases from Florida and New York from 2000-2005 were analyzed for lower extremity revascularization (LER, n = 73,532), carotid revascularization (CR, n = 116,578), or abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (AAA, n = 35,593), using ICD-9 codes for diagnosis and procedure. The indications for intervention as well as the post-operative outcomes were examined assigning insurance status as the independent variable. Patients covered under a variety of commercial insurers, as well as Medicare, were compared to those who either had no insurance or were covered by Medicaid.\nPatients without insurance or with Medicaid were at significantly greater risk of presenting with a ruptured AAA compared to insured (non-Medicaid) patients; while insurance status did not seem to impact post-operative mortality rates for elective and ruptured AAA repair. The uninsured or Medicaid recipients presented with symptomatic carotid disease nearly twice as often as the insured, but stroke rates after CR did not differ significantly based on insurance status. Patients with Medicaid or without insurance were more likely to present with limb threatening ischemia than claudication. In contrast to AAA repair and CR, the outcomes of LER were worse in the uninsured and Medicaid beneficiaries who had higher rates of post-revascularization amputation compared to the insured (non-Medicaid) group.\nInsurance status predicts disease severity at the time of treatment, but once treated, the outcomes are similar among insurance categories, with the exception of lower extremity revascularization. This data suggests inferior access to preventative vascular care in the Medicaid and the uninsured populations.",

Patients were retrospectively divided in two groups according to treatment with the bifurcated graft only (n = 126), or its placement on the bifurcation with the addition of a proximal extension (n = 79) at the initial procedure. Study end points included postoperative complications, secondary procedures, immediate and late conversion, migration, endoleak, death, and aneurysmal sac behavior.\nOverall technical success was 98.5%. Additional procedures were performed in 18%, and postoperative complications occurred in 11.2% (systemic, 8.3%; local, 2.9%). Median follow-up was 42.4 months (range, 6-94 months). Secondary procedures were recorded in 11.2%, migration in 3.9%, type I proximal endoleak in 7.8%, and late conversions in 2.4%. Placement on the bifurcation and the addition of an extension were associated with a higher incidence of postoperative complications (7.1% vs 17.7%, P = .020). A reduced incidence of endoleak (19% vs 8.9%, P = .048), secondary procedures (14.3% vs 6.3%, P = .04), and migration (6.3% vs 0%, P = .024) were observed in the group with a proximal extension. Analysis of single variables reveals that migration was significantly influenced by placement of the graft on the bifurcation (47% vs 0%, P < .001). Both placement on the bifurcation and the addition of an extension positively influenced the type I proximal endoleak rate (3.8% vs 35.3% P < .001) and the need for a secondary intervention (6.3% vs 35.3% P < .001) Two aneurysm ruptures and five cases of late conversion occurred in the group treated with a bifurcated graft only (4%, P = .52, P = .159).

    "abstract": "This study investigated risk factors for stroke or death after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) among hospitals of varying type and size participating in a regional quality improvement effort.\nWe reviewed 2714 patients undergoing 3092 primary CEAs (excluding combined procedures or redo CEA) at 11 hospitals in Northern New England from January 2003 through December 2007. Hospitals varied in size (25 to 615 beds) and comprised community and teaching hospitals. Fifty surgeons reported results to the database. Trained research personnel prospectively collected >70 demographic and clinical variables for each patient. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to generate odds ratios (ORs) and prediction models for the 30-day postoperative stroke or death rate.\nAcross 3092 CEAs, there were 38 minor strokes, 14 major strokes, and eight deaths (5 stroke-related) < or =30 days of the index procedure (30-day stroke or death rate, 1.8%). In multivariate analyses, emergency CEA (OR, 7.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-26.9; P = .004), contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3-6.2; P = .009), preoperative ipsilateral cortical stroke (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.1; P = .02), congestive heart failure (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4, P = .03), and age >70 (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8-2.3; P = .315) were associated with postoperative stroke or death. Preoperative antiplatelet therapy was protective (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9; P = .02). Risk of stroke or death varied from <1% in patients with no risk factors to nearly 5% with patients with > or =3 risk factors. Our risk prediction model had excellent correlation with observed results (r = 0.96) and reasonable discriminative ability (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.71). Risks varied from <1% in asymptomatic patients with no risk factors to nearly 4% in patients with contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-8.1; P = .01) and age >70 (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.0-4.9, P = .05). Two hospitals performed significantly better than expected. These differences were not attributable to surgeon or hospital volume.\nSurgeons can \"risk-stratify\" preoperative patients by considering the variables (emergency procedure, contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion, preoperative ipsilateral cortical stroke, congestive heart failure, and age), reducing risk with antiplatelet agents, and informing patients more precisely about their risk of stroke or death after CEA. Risk prediction models can also be used to compare risk-adjusted outcomes between centers, identify best practices, and hopefully, improve overall results.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of patients with chronic arterial occlusions involving the superficial femoral artery has changed significantly with the incorporation of subintimal angioplasty (SIA) into vascular surgery practice. To more clearly define technical feasibility, patency, and clinical outcomes of SIA, we reviewed our cumulative experience.\nA retrospective review of all patients who underwent SIA of arterial occlusions originating in the superficial femoral artery was performed. Patient history, demographics, procedural details, and follow-up information were collected and analyzed. Patency, limb salvage, sustained improvement in claudication, freedom from surgical bypass, and survival were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis.\nFrom December, 2002, through July, 2006, 506 infrainguinal SIA procedures were performed in 472 patients with chronic arterial occlusion involving the superficial femoral artery. The mean age of patients treated was 69.4 +/- 11.9 years and the indication for intervention was critical limb ischemia in 63% of limbs (n = 317) and disabling claudication in 37% (n = 189). Forty-seven percent of limbs (n = 237) had isolated SFA occlusions, 40% (n = 205) had femoropopliteal occlusions, and 13% of limbs had occlusions beginning in the SFA and extending into the tibial arteries (n = 64). Technical success was achieved in 87% of procedures. Following successful SIA, the mean ankle-brachial index increased by 54%, from 0.50 +/- 0.16 to 0.77 +/- 0.23 (P < .0001). Median follow-up was 12.4 months (0-48 months) and 30-day mortality was 0.8%. Primary patency at 12 and 36 months was 45% (SE 3.0%) and 25% (SE 3.6%) respectively. Secondary patency was 76% (SE 2.6%) and 50% (SE 4.8%) at 12 and 36 months. Factors associated with reduced primary patency included femorotibial occlusions (HR 1.57, CI 1.05-2.36) and the presence of critical limb ischemia (HR 1.39, CI 1.02-1.89). Limb salvage in patients with critical limb ischemia was 75% (SE 5.9%) at 36 months. Freedom from surgical bypass in patients with either critical limb ischemia or disabling claudication was 77% (SE 4.1%) at 36 months.\nSIA is an effective percutaneous technique for the revascularization of patients with lower extremity chronic arterial occlusions involving the superficial femoral artery. The procedure is successfully performed in all segments of the lower extremity with minimal morbidity or mortality. Rates of limb salvage and improvement in claudication are similar to those achieved by open surgical bypass, while modest reductions in limb salvage and primary patency are experienced in limbs with femorotibial occlusions.",

    "abstract": "The optimal duplex ultrasound (DUS) velocity criteria to determine in-stent carotid restenosis are controversial. We previously reported the optimal DUS velocities for >or=30% in-stent restenosis. This prospective study will further define the optimal velocities in detecting various severities of in-stent restenosis: >or=30%, >or=50%, and 80% to 99%.\nThe analysis included 144 patients who underwent carotid artery stenting as a part of clinical trials. All patients had completion arteriograms and underwent postoperative carotid DUS imaging, which was repeated at 1 month and every 6 months thereafter. Patients with peak systolic velocities (PSVs) of the internal carotid artery (ICA) of >or=130 cm/s underwent carotid computed tomography (CT)/angiogram. The PSVs and end-diastolic velocities of the ICA and common carotid artery (CCA) and the PSV of the ICA/CCA ratios were recorded. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to determine the optimal velocity criteria for the diagnosis of >or=30, >or=50, and >or=80% restenosis.\nThe mean follow-up was 20 months (range, 1-78 months). Available for analysis were 215 pairs of imaging (DUS vs CTA/angiography) studies. The accuracy of CTA vs carotid arteriogram was confirmed in a subset of 22 patients (kappa = 0.81). The ROC analysis demonstrated that an ICA PSV of >or=154 cm/s was optimal for >or=30% stenosis with a sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 89%, positive-predictive value (PPV) of 96%, negative-predictive value (NPV) of 97%, and overall accuracy (OA) of 96%. An ICA EDV of 42 cm/s had sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and OA in detecting >or=30% stenosis of 86%, 62%, 87%, 60%, and 80%, respectively. An ICA PSV of >or=224 cm/s was optimal for >50% stenosis with a sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 90%, PPV of 99%, NPV of 90%, and OA of 98%. An ICA EDV of 88 cm/s had sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and OA in detecting >or=50% stenosis of 96%, 100%, 100%, 100%, 53%, and 96%. An ICA/CCA ratio of 3.439 had sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and OA in detecting >or=50% stenosis of 96%, 100%, 100%, 100%, 58%, and 96%, respectively. An ICA PSV of >or=325 cm/s was optimal for >80% stenosis with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 99%, PPV of 100%, NPV of 88%, and OA of 99%. An ICA EDV of 119 cm/sec had sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and OA in detecting >or=80% stenosis of 99%, 100%, 100%, 100%, 75%, and 99%, respectively. The PSV of the stented artery was a better predictor for in-stent restenosis than the end-diastolic velocity or ICA/CCA ratio.\nThe optimal DUS velocity criteria for in-stent restenosis of >or=30%, >or=50%, and >or=80% were the PSVs of 154, 224, and 325 cm/s, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Venous diseases are among the most frequent diseases in the general population of industrialized countries. The aim of this article is to investigate the population-based prevalence of pathologic reflux in superficial and deep leg veins, taking into account factors as gender, age, and clinical classification of venous disease.\nIn a population-based cross-sectional study, 3072 subjects aged 18 to 79 years (1350 male, 1722 female, response 59%) were enrolled from October 2000 through November 2001. A standardized interview was conducted to document phlebological history and clinical examinations including duplex sonography of selected superficial and deep leg veins. Pathological reflux was defined as being >500 ms. All participants where classified according to the CEAP classification.\nUsing the highest clinical stage per participant, 9.6% where classified C0, 59.0% C1, 14.3% C2, 13.5% C3, 2.9% C4, and 0.7% C5-C6. A pathological reflux (>500 ms) was found in 35.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 33.6-37.1) of subjects with 21.0% (95% CI 19.5-22.5) showing reflux in at least one superficial vein and 20.0% (95% CI 18.6-21.5) showing reflux in at least one deep vein. We observed significantly higher reflux prevalence for the superficial veins in women while for the deep veins reflux prevalence were significantly higher in men. Prevalence of reflux in the superficial veins markedly increases with age. In the deep venous system, no clear changes in reflux prevalence with age can be observed. For superficial veins, reflux prevalence is markedly higher with higher C-stages. For the deep veins, the proportion of refluxes is relatively constant in stages C0-C3 with a distinct increase of prevalence from stage C4 onward.\nOur results show a high prevalence of reflux both for the superficial and the deep venous system. Reflux prevalence is associated with gender, age, and the clinical stage as measured by the CEAP classification. Further longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the relevance of pathological reflux in subjects with otherwise healthy veins.",

    "abstract": "For good rehabilitation candidates, the biomechanical advantages of the end weight-bearing through-knee amputation (TKAmp) compared with the above knee amputation (AKA) are well established. However, the TKAmp has been abandoned by vascular surgeons because of poor wound healing rates related to long tissue flaps and challenges to prosthetic fitting related to the femoral condyles. Since 1998, we have performed the modified \"Mazet\" technique TKAmp procedure that creates shorter flaps to close the wound and greatly facilitates prosthesis fitting. The purpose of this study is to review our results with TKAmp in patients with peripheral vascular disease who were not candidates for below-knee amputation.\nThe records of all patients who underwent through-knee amputation between 1998 and 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. Mean follow-up was 33 months (range, 38 days to 99 months). Amputations for trauma and malignancy were excluded. Patient survival, maintenance of ambulation, and independent living status were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis methods.\nFifty patients underwent TKAmp using a modified Mazet technique. The mean age was 63 years; 50% were men, and 50% had diabetes mellitus. All patients had peripheral arterial disease. Thirty-five patients (70%) had prior revascularization procedures. Those patients averaged 2.2 revascularization procedures prior to amputation. There were three (6%) perioperative deaths. The ipsilateral common femoral artery was patent in 43/50 (86%) of patients at the time of amputation. Forty patients (80%) had open wounds and three patients (6%) had a failed below-knee amputation at the time of TKAmp. Thirty-eight patients (81%) healed their TKAmp wound. Nine patients failed to heal and were revised to an above knee amputation. The cumulative probability of regular prosthetic usage and maintenance of ambulation was estimated to be 0.56 at 3 years and 0.41 at 5 years. The probability of maintaining independent living status at 3 and 5 years was 0.77 and 0.65, respectively. Survival probabilities for patients in this series were 0.60 at 3 years and 0.44 at 5 years.\nThese data show that the TKAmp is associated with an acceptable primary healing rate and satisfactory functional outcomes in patients with peripheral arterial disease. The advantages of TKAmp over AKA make it the preferred alternative for patients with vascular disease who are candidates for prosthetic rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia and infarction after surgery remain leading causes of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing major vascular surgery. B-type natriuretic peptide has been shown to predict early postoperative cardiac events in patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery. We aimed to determine if N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), with its longer half-life and greater plasma stability, can predict postoperative myocardial injury in vascular patients.\nRecruited were 136 patients undergoing elective surgery for subcritical limb ischemia or abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Plasma NT-pro-BNP was measured preoperatively, and troponin-I was measured immediately after surgery and on postoperative days 1, 2, 3, and 5.\nTwenty-eight patients (20%) sustained postoperative myocardial injury (troponin-I rise of >0.1 ng/mL). The median NT-pro-BNP level of those with myocardial injury was significantly higher than those who did not (380 pg/mL [interquartile range (IQR), 223-967] vs 209 pg/mL [109-363]; P = .003). NT-pro-BNP predicted this outcome with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 68% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56%-0.78%). In a multivariate analysis, a NT-pro-BNP value of >/=308 pg/mL (the optimal ROC curve-derived cutoff) was associated with an increased incidence of myocardial injury (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.41-9.09, P =.01).\nElevated preoperative plasma NT-pro-BNP levels independently predict postoperative myocardial injury, which is associated with adverse outcome in the short- and long-term regardless of the presence of symptoms of acute coronary syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Traditional recommendations for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) risk factor reduction include smoking cessation, low-fat/low-salt diet, exercise, and optimal medical management of chronic disease. Little attention has been paid to the role of dietary supplementation of specific nutrients in the prevention of PAD.\nThis cross-sectional study used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to determine specific nutrients that are associated with prevalent PAD in the United States (US) population. NHANES data include nationwide sampling of the US population, using physical examination, questionnaire, and laboratory testing. PAD status was defined by an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of <0.9. Nutritional information was collected by 24-hour dietary recall using the US Department of Agriculture dietary collection instrument. Data were linked to a database of foods and their nutrient composition. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate associations between specific nutrient intake and the presence of PAD. Multivariate models adjusted for the effects of age, gender, hypertension, coronary vascular disease, diabetes, and smoking.\nNHANES data for 1999 to 2004 included 7203 lower extremity examinations, of which 422 individuals had prevalent PAD (5.9%). Examinees with PAD had significantly higher rates of hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and smoking than those without PAD. Univariate analysis revealed that consumption of all nutrients considered were associated with lower odds of PAD, including antioxidants (vitamins A, C, and E), folate, other B vitamins (B(6), B(12)), fiber, and polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids. After adjustment for traditional risk factors, nutrients associated with reduced prevalence of PAD were vitamin A (odds ratio [OR], 0.79; P = .036), vitamin C (OR, 0.84; P < .001), vitamin E (OR, 0.78; P = .011), vitamin B(6) (OR, 0.71; P = .023), fiber (OR, 0.65; P < .001), folate (OR, 0.67; P = .006), and omega-3 (alpha-linolenic) fatty acid (OR, 0.79; P = .028).\nImproved nutrition is associated with a reduced prevalence of PAD in the US population. Higher consumption of specific nutrients, including antioxidants (vitamin A, C, and E), vitamin B(6), fiber, folate, and omega-3 fatty acids have a significant protective effect, irrespective of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. These findings suggest specific dietary supplementation may afford additional protection, above traditional risk factor modification, for the prevention of PAD.",

Coronary artery disease is highly prevalent in patients with TAA, with a reported prevalence of 30% to 70%. Knowledge of the underlying cardiac pathology can minimize perioperative risk and improve patient selection. This study investigated the feasibility of simultaneous assessment of thoracic aortic pathology and cardiac structures and function, including the coronary arteries, using electrocardiogram-gated 64-slice computed tomography (CT) angiography.\nECG-gated 64-detector row CT examinations of 11 patients (8 men, 3 women; mean age, 67 +/- 16; range, 41-83 years) with thoracic aortic pathology, including aneurysms and dissections, were reviewed. Images were assessed for coronary artery disease, calcifications, cardiac function, and valve characteristics. Simultaneous assessment and measurements of thoracic aortic pathology were performed with the same scan.\nAll images of the patients could be successfully assessed for calcium scores, coronary artery stenoses, coronary artery anomalies, interventricular septal wall thickness, myocardial scar, left ventricular ejection fraction, muscle mass, and aortic and mitral valve calcification, mobility, and valve anatomy. Diagnostic image quality was also achieved in all patients for the underlying thoracic aortic disease.\nThis study introduces the feasibility of dynamic imaging of the thoracic aorta and cardiac structures and function, including the coronary arteries, with just one CT scan. The images could be successfully assessed for thoracic aorta pathology, cardiac disease, and extracardiac pathology. With further developments of CT scanners-and more detailed insight in the prognosis of patients based on ECG-gated CTA findings-this new technique may become the initial imaging modality for preoperative cardiac risk stratification in patients with TAAs or dissections.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate national outcomes after open repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (DTA).\nThe DTA repairs were identified from the NIS database from 1988-2003 by ICD9 codes for thoracic vascular resection and replacement (38.45) and a diagnosis of intact (441.1) or ruptured (441.2) thoracic aortic aneurysm; excluding thoraco-abdominal aneurysm, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, cardioplegia, hypothermia, cardiac surgery, or aorta to carotid or subclavian bypass. Demographics and comorbidities were noted. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and complications. Annual hospital surgical volume terciles (high, medium, and low) were quantified for the series and patients assigned accordingly. Outcomes were compared between intact and ruptured aneurysm characteristics as well as annual hospital volume. Predictors of peri-operative mortality were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression.\nA total of 2549 DTA repairs were identified (1976 intact, 573 ruptured). Mortality was 18% overall; 10% for intact (age <65 6.2%, 65-74 11.3%, >/=75 17.6%, P < .001), 45% for ruptured (age <65 33.3%, 65-74 47.1%, >/=75 52.4%, P < .001). Mortality decreased over the 15-year time-period (P < .0001). Mortality after intact repair was lower at a high volume hospital (HVH) (8%) than a low volume hospital (LVH) (13%) or medium volume hospital (MVH) (12%). Hospital volume tercile did not predict rupture mortality. Complications after intact DTA repair were coded in 42%; including respiratory (13%), cardiac (11%), acute renal failure (8%), stroke (3%), and neurologic (non-stroke) (2%). Complications were coded in 49% after ruptured DTA repair including respiratory (13%), cardiac (13%), acute renal failure (20%), stroke (3%), and neuro (non-stroke) (2%). Predictors of mortality (for all DTA repairs) were (odd ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [CI]): age 65-74 vs age <65 (1.8, 1.4-2.4), age >/=75 vs age <65 (2.7, 2.0-3.6), rupture (6.3, 5.1-7.9), and LVH or MVH vs HVH (1.3, 1.1-1.7).\nMortality after open repair of DTA is high and complications are common. Mortality is dependent upon age, rupture status, and hospital surgical volume. Results of endovascular DTA repair should be compared using similar population-based data.",

    "abstract": "Fusion of the spine is often performed from an anterior approach requiring mobilization of aorta, iliac artery, and vein. This study describes the preferred techniques and incidence of vascular complications at a spine center.\nInformation and operative notes on all consecutive patients undergoing anterior exposure were entered into a database that was retrospectively reviewed. Four hundred eighty-two procedures performed on 480 patients at one spine center between January of 1997 and December of 2002 were analyzed. Demographics, technique, levels of exposure, and history of prior spine surgery were recorded. Primary outcomes measured included intraoperative vascular complications, estimated operative blood loss, and operative mortality. Vascular injury was defined as any case in which a suture was required to control bleeding. Major vascular injuries were defined as those requiring transfusion, vascular reconstruction, or blood loss greater than 300 cc.\nAn intraoperative vascular injury occurred in 11% (54/480) of patients. The majority of these (45/54) were minor injuries treated with simple suture repair. Nine (1.9%) major vascular injuries did occur; the majority identified and treated during the exposure and not the spinal fusion. One patient required a return to the operating room 24 hours after the initial procedure for removal of packs placed to control severe bleeding from an avulsed branch of the internal iliac vein. Median estimated blood loss (EBL) was 150 cc and there were no mortalities. Eighty-three percent of overall injuries involved exposure of L4-5, and this was statistically significant odds ratio (OR) 2.73, P = .005. The lowest incidence of injury occurred when L5-S1 alone was exposed (5.1% of injuries) OR .34, P = .01. Prior spine procedures did not significantly increase the risk of injury, P = .67. Other factors that did not significantly increase risk included gender, multiple levels vs single levels and technique of exposure.\nExposure to the lumbar spine can be readily accomplished via a retroperitoneal approach. Minor vascular injuries during exposure, mostly venous, are not uncommon and are easily repaired. They are increased when L4-5 is part of the exposure and are lowest when L5-S1 alone is exposed. Major injuries occur in less than 2% of patients.",

    "abstract": "Data from multicenter symptomatic trials have shown that benefit from carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was greatest in patients with carotid disease operated within 2 weeks of their last ischemic event. We prospectively analyzed the safety and benefit of CEA performed within 2 weeks of a stroke.\nThe study involved patients with acute minor stroke admitted to two stroke units who underwent CEA within 2 weeks of their last ischemic event, once they were considered neurologically stable. Preoperative workup included scoring ischemia-related symptoms according to a modified ranking scale (mRS), carotid duplex scan, transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and head computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. All patients underwent neurological assessment on admission, 1 day before and 2 days after CEA, and at discharge. A complete neurological and ultrasound follow-up was performed at 1, 6, and 12 months after CEA, then yearly. All procedures were eversion CEA under deep general anesthesia, with selective shunting. Endpoints were perioperative (30-day) stroke/mortality rate or cerebral bleeding and long-term stroke recurrence or cerebral hemorrhage.\nBetween 2000 and 2005, 102 patients with a mRS </= 2 underwent CEA within a median 8 days of acute ischemic stroke. Shunting and contralateral carotid occlusion were found significantly correlated. There were no perioperative strokes or deaths, or cerebral hemorrhage. All patients were followed up for a mean 34 months (range 1-66) with no recurrent stroke or cerebral bleeding.\nCEA can be performed within 2 weeks of carotid-related ischemic stroke with no perioperative stroke or cerebral bleeding, preventing the risk of stroke recurrence.",

However, limited population-based data are available on use of statin therapy in these patients in Canada. We sought to study trends in statin use to treat these patients in Ontario during a 10-year period.\nWe conducted a population-based cross-sectional time series analysis between April 1, 1995, and March 31, 2004, using health care data from Ontario, Canada.\nDuring the study period, 343,154 elderly patients with atherosclerosis were identified. Of these, 235,615 (68.7%) had coronary artery diseases (CAD), 115,012 (33.5%) had cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and 23,886 (7.0%) had peripheral arterial disease (PAD). About 46% were women, and mean patient age was 77.1 (SD, 7.5) years. During the study period, the percentage of patients treated with a statin in each group increased considerably, from 9.8% to 55.3% in all atherosclerotic patients (P < .01), from 11.8% to 61.2% in CAD patients (P < .01), from 5.3% to 41.2% in CVD patients (P < .01), and from 6.8% to 43.3% in PAD patients (P < .01). During the entire study period, the percentage of statin users was lowest among PAD and CVD patients, followed by patients with both a history of PAD and CVD.\nThe use of statin therapy in elderly patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis has increased substantially during the past decade, but many patients remain untreated. The suboptimal use is greatest among patients with PAD or CVD, or both, and lowest in patients with CAD. Given the heightened risk of cardiovascular adverse outcomes in patients with atherosclerosis, these data have important and immediate implications.",

VSMCs transfected with AdTE-GFP in vitro and in vivo were detected by fluorescence microscopy. The TE mRNA levels and the level of recombinant elastin expression of AdTE-GFP transfected VSMCs in vitro (at 1, 3, and 5 days) and in vivo (at 2 and 4 weeks) were compared by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. The aortic diameters (AD) of the aneurysms were measured at three time points (immediately, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks post-perfusion) and comparisons were made among the AdTE-GFP transfected group, an empty adenovirus (AdNull) transfected group, and a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) perfused group. Formation of new elastic fibers in vivo was assessed by histologic analysis.\nAdTE-GFP transfection reversed AAA formation (mean +/- standard error), with the controls showing increased ADs (a 48.50 +/- 16.55% increase for the PBS perfusion group and a 39.84 +/- 15.59% increase for the AdNull treated group) and the AdTE-GFP transfected group showing a decreased AD (23.04 +/- 14.49%, P < .01). Histological studies showed that the AdTE-GFP transfected group also had reconstructed elastic fibers in the aneurysmal wall. Real-time PCR for TE mRNA demonstrated a significant increase upon transfection of AdTE-GFP in vitro and in vivo. Western blot analysis for GFP demonstrated elastin-GFP expression only upon transfection of AdTE-GFP, although the amount of elastin-GFP protein tended to be lower in vivo than in vitro. Elastin von-Giesson stain combined with GFP antibody immunohistochemistry demonstrated new elastic fibers in the transfected aneurysmal VSMCs.\nVSMCs were transfected efficiently with a special AdTE-GFP vector, enabling recombinant elastin to be produced in these VSMCs in vitro and in vivo. This expression of a recombinant elastin and the related reconstruction of elastic fibers within the aneurysmal tissue appeared to prevent or reverse the aneurysm dilatation.",

    "abstract": "The patency of prosthetic grafts is partly limited by incomplete endothelial cell coverage and development of anastomotic intimal hyperplasia. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of elevated cholesterol on prosthetic graft healing and the ability of alpha-tocopherol to improve healing.\nRabbits were placed on one of four diets: chow, chow plus 1% cholesterol, chow plus alpha-tocopherol, or chow plus 1% cholesterol and alpha-tocopherol. After 2 weeks, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (12-cm long, 4-mm internal diameter) were implanted in the abdominal aorta. Grafts were removed after 6 weeks and analyzed for cholesterol and alpha-tocopherol content, endothelial coverage, anastomotic intimal thickness, and cellular composition of the neointima.\nAt the time of graft implantation, plasma cholesterol was 34 +/- 4 mg/dL in the chow group and 689 +/- 30 mg/dL in the 1% cholesterol group (P < .05). Grafts removed from hypercholesterolemic rabbits had marked intimal thickening, with an intima/graft thickness ratio of 0.76 +/- 0.29 compared with 0.14 +/- 0.06 in chow animals (P < .05). Macrophage infiltrate was increased to 45 +/- 11 macrophages/0.625 mm(2) in grafts from hypercholesterolemic rabbits compared with 0 +/- 0.4 in controls (P < .05). Endothelialization of grafts was lower in hypercholesterolemic rabbits than in the chow group, with endothelial cells covering 46% +/- 7% and 62% +/- 7% of the graft surface, respectively (P = .05). When alpha-tocopherol was added to the 1% cholesterol diet, the macrophage count decreased to 12 +/- 8, the intimal/graft thickness ratio decreased to 0.17 +/- 0.09, and endothelial coverage increased to 70% +/- 7% (P < .05 compared with the high-cholesterol group).\nAnastomotic intimal hyperplasia is dramatically increased and endothelialization is reduced in rabbits on a high-cholesterol diet, but alpha-tocopherol supplementation blocks the augmented neointimal thickening and improves endothelial cell coverage.",

In 15 patients (83%), no protective measure of the kidney was used. In seven patients, the reconstruction remained proximal to the renal artery whereas in 11 patients it required the reattachment of the artery to the prosthesis.\nThere was no mortality after the operation. A moderate increase of blood creatinine occurred in all patients but by the end of the tenth postoperative day, all patients had regained renal function identical to the preoperative state. In the long-term follow-up, nine late deaths occurred, mainly due to myocardial infarct (N = 7), and chronic rejection led to hemodialysis in three patients. Six patients are alive with a functioning transplant. The follow-up ranges from 5 to 30 years.\nOpen repair of aortoiliac aneurysms can be safely undertaken in renal transplant recipients without protection of the transplanted kidney. In the long-term follow-up, these patients are exposed to complications of general arteriosclerosis and to rejection of their transplanted kidney. Aortic aneurysms following kidney transplantation are likely to become more frequent in the future due to extension of renal transplantation to older and severely arteriosclerotic patients.",

    "abstract": "While autogenous arteriovenous access is preferred, prosthetic arteriovenous grafts (AVG) are still required in a large number of patients. Infection of AVGs occurs frequently and may cause life-threatening bleeding or sepsis. Multiple treatment strategies have been advocated (ranging from graft preservation to excision with complex concomitant reconstructions), indicating a lack of consensus on appropriate management of infected AVGs. We undertook this study to evaluate if, in the setting of anastomotic involvement, brachial artery ligation distal to the origin of the deep brachial artery accompanied by total graft excision (BAL) is safe and effective.\nAll prosthetic arteriovenous graft infections managed by a single surgeon between 1995 and 2006 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were identified from a computerized vascular registry, and data were obtained via patient charts and the electronic medical record.\nWe identified 45 AVG infections in 43 patients. Twenty-one patients (49%) demonstrated arterial anastomotic involvement and were treated with BAL; these form the cohort for this analysis. Mean patient age was 53.2 (SD 9.5) years. The primary etiologies for end stage renal disease (ESRD) were hypertension (29%), HIV (24%), and diabetes (19%). An upper arm AVG was present in 95% of patients; one (5%) had a forearm AVG. The majority of grafts were polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (90%). Follow-up was 100% at 1 month, 86% at 3 months, and 67% at 6 months. No ischemic or septic complications occurred in the 21 patients who underwent BAL.\nBAL is an effective and expeditious method to deal with an infected arm AVG in frequently critically ill patients with densely scarred wounds. In the short term, BAL appears to be well tolerated without resulting ischemic complications. Further study with longer duration of follow-up is necessary to ascertain whether BAL results in definitive cure, or whether patients may ultimately manifest ischemic changes and require additional intervention.",

However, a review of the original cohort supplemented by experience with a further 47 lesions has demonstrated less desirable results.\nFrom December 2003 through July 2007, 92 lesions in 64 consecutive patients were treated and followed up for a median of 16 months with statistically significant follow-up at 24 months.\nThe immediate technical success rate was 88%. Nine stents were immediately required after unsuccessful CryoPlasty (9.8%) five of which were as a result of a dissection. No unanticipated adverse events occurred, specifically, no thrombus, acute occlusions, distal embolizations, aneurysms, or groin complications. Vascular calcification was responsible for technical failure in six of the 11 immediately unsuccessful procedures. Freedom from restenosis for successfully treated lesions was 57% and 49% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. CryoPlasty of heavily calcified lesions, vein graft lesions, and in-stent stenosis faired poorly. Excluding these lesions from analysis would have resulted in an immediate success of 94% (81 of 86) and freedom from restenosis of 61% and 52% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. However, on an intention-to-treat basis, freedom from restenosis was 47% and 38% at 12 and 24 months, and CryoPlasty added approximately $1700 to the cost of each procedure.\nAnalysis of this expanded, longer-term data suggests that our earlier, smaller study provided an overly optimistic appraisal of the benefits of CryoPlasty. It is possible that a larger analysis might have identified a subset of patients or lesions that would benefit from CryoPlasty, but considering the additional cost, we no longer use this technique in our practice.",

    "abstract": "Recommended postoperative surveillance after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) includes serial contrast-enhanced CT scans. The cumulative deleterious effect on renal function, radiation exposure, and significant cost of this surveillance regimen are all problematic. However, there are scant data to support modulation of current post-EVAR surveillance regimens.\nThe study comprised patients who underwent EVAR as part of the prospective multicenter pivotal (phase II) and continued-access (phase III) US Zenith Endovascular (Cook, Bloomington, Ind) graft trials. A core lab prospectively recorded patient data. A composite aneurysm-related morbidity (ARM) variable was calculated to include aneurysm rupture, open conversion, any secondary intervention, limb thrombosis, migration, renal morbidity, or aneurysm-related death. The long-term freedom from ARM as a function of the presence or cumulative absence of any endoleak at 1, 6, and 12 months was analyzed. The potential additive predictive utility of aneurysm sac shrinkage (>/=5 mm) was assessed at 12 months. The instructions for use for aortic neck anatomy (>/=15 mm length, 18 to 28 mm diameter, </=60 degrees angulation) were followed.\nEVAR was done in 739 patients (mean follow-up, 29.9 +/- 17.1 months). Freedom from endoleak at 1 month was highly predictive (P < .001) of reduced ARM: freedom from ARM was 92.3%, 89.8%, 85.2%, 83.1% and 83.1 % at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, in patients without endoleak (83.1%) and 75%, 67.1%, 61.5%, 55.9%, and 55.9% in patients with endoleak (16.9%). Cumulative absence of endoleak at 1 year (77.6%) was associated with 94%, 91.5%, 88.1%, 85.8%, and 85.8% 1- to 5-year freedom from ARM vs 73.3%, 66.7%, 56.6%, 52.5%, and 52.5% in patients with endoleak </=1 year (22.4%), P < .001. In patients without endoleak at 12 months, the subsequent risk of any ARM was 8.2% (5-year risk, 14.2%; 1-year risk, 6.0%). In patients with significant sac shrinkage (>/=5 mm) and cumulative absence of endoleak at 12 months, the subsequent risk of an ARM was 5.3% (5-year risk, 11.1%; 1-year risk, 5.8%).\nAbsence of endoleak at 30 and 365 days predicted greatly improved long-term freedom from ARM compared with early endoleak. A new EVAR surveillance regimen is recommended that modulates the intensity and frequency of postoperative imaging based on these early outcomes. In patients without early endoleak, the 6-month surveillance is eliminated, and aortic ultrasound is suggested for long-term surveillance >1 year. In most patients, this reduced surveillance regimen would be appropriate and could improve patient safety by reducing the cumulative deleterious effects of intravenous contrast and radiation exposure while also reducing health care costs. These subjective recommendations would be ideally validated in a randomized, prospective trial.",

    "abstract": "Classic studies of limb ischemia-reperfusion injury have been performed using young healthy mice. However, patients with peripheral vascular disease are older and often exhibit metabolic derangements that may delay healing after revascularization. Mice with genetic deletion of apolipoprotein E (ApoE(-/-)) have been used as a model in various experimental scenarios of hypercholesterolemia. These experiments evaluated the inflammatory response and changes in skeletal muscle morphology during the acute and chronic phases of limb ischemia-reperfusion injury in aged ApoE(-/-) mice.\nAge-matched ApoE(-/-) and wild-type (Wt) mice underwent 1.5 hours of unilateral hind limb ischemia, followed by 1, 7, or 14 days of reperfusion (DR). Histologic analysis of skeletal muscle fiber injury was assessed at 1DR. Morphologic evidence of muscular fiber maturation was assessed at 14DR. Levels of MyoD and myogenin, markers of skeletal muscle differentiation, were assessed at 7 and 14DR using Western blots. Markers of inflammation, including myeloperoxidase, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and osteopontin, were assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) using Western blots at 1, 7, and 14DR. After 1DR, tissue adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) levels were measured to assess metabolic activity. Unpaired t test and Mann-Whitney test were used for comparisons.\nHistologic evaluation of skeletal muscle after 1DR showed no difference in the degree of injury between Wt and ApoE(-/-) mice. However, at 14DR, ApoE(-/-) mice had higher percentage of immature muscle fibers than Wt mice. Myogenin level was lower in the ApoE(-/-) mice at 7DR. Injured skeletal muscle of ApoE(-/-) mice had lower levels of myeloperoxidase than Wt mice at 7 DR and higher levels of MCP-1 at 14DR. There was no difference in the levels of tissue ATP, MIP-2, osteopontin, or CCR2 at all experimental intervals.\nAlthough there was no difference between the injured muscle of Wt and ApoE(-/-) mice during the acute phase of reperfusion, ApoE(-/-) mice showed delay in skeletal muscle healing during the chronic phase of reperfusion. This lag in muscle regeneration was associated with lower levels of myogenin at 7DR and an increased level of MCP-1 at 14DR in the ApoE(-/-) mice. The delay in skeletal muscle healing in the ApoE(-/-) mice may have broader implications for poor tissue healing and functional recovery in elderly patients who have vascular risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the relationships between the interface pressure produced by intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices, the deformation of extremity tissues produced by this pressure, and changes in venous blood flow associated with this deformation by use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and duplex ultrasound (DUS) imaging in addition to the pressure measurement.\nThe calf garments of two IPC devices (WizAir, Medical Compression Systems, Inc, Ltd, Or-Akiva, Israel; VenaFlow, AirCast Inc, Summit, NJ) were tested in five healthy volunteers. The interface pressure was measured with Tactilus Human Body Interface sensor system (Sensor Products Inc, Madison, NJ). Changes in tissue volumes were assessed with MRI. Velocity and flow changes in the great saphenous vein (GSV) and femoral veins (FV) were evaluated by DUS scans.\nThe spatial distribution of interface pressure differed substantially between the two devices. These differences were in the location and percentage of calf surface area to which different pressure was applied. Both devices produced the tissue compression consistent with each device's unique pattern of the interface pressure distribution. Compression by the IPC devices was associated with a measurable decrease in the volume of subcutaneous tissue under the garment, the total volume of superficial veins, and the volume of the GSV. No measurable changes occurred in subfascial volume of the calf. Compression was associated with significant increase in flow velocities in the GSV and FV. The increase of volume flow was significant in FV, but not in GSV. Comparing hemodynamic data with MRI data showed that the flow velocity increase in FV and GSV caused by IPC highly correlated with decrease in volume of superficial veins and subcutaneous tissue measured by MRI, but not with changes in subfascial volume. A single strongest predictor of venous flow increase was the change in subcutaneous veins volume.\nThis methodology provides means for the investigation of relationships between the pressure in the garment, interface pressure, tissue deformation, and hemodynamic respond to IPC. The clinical efficacy of IPC should not be explicitly attributed to the magnitude of the pressure in the garment. Similar hemodynamic responses to IPC can be produced by different spatial distributions of pressure resulting in different patterns of tissue compression. Further investigation of biomechanical mechanisms of IPC is needed to guide the development of better engineering solutions for mechanical devices aimed at prevention of venous thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic surgery is sometimes complicated by subacute or delayed paraplegia. Pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta has been implicated in extensive inflammation and progressive neurodegeneration after ischemia. Using a rabbit model, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in a temporal fashion.\nSpinal cord ischemia was induced by aortic cross-clamping in New Zealand White rabbits. The animals were assigned to three groups. Group C (n = 20) received saline (0.2-mL) and Group I (n = 20) received IL-1ra (200-microg/0.2-mL) intrathecally just after reperfusion. Group S (n = 3) underwent sham operation without aortic occlusion. We assessed the neuroprotective effects of IL-1ra by evaluating neurological function, histopathological changes, and in-situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL staining). We also measured the levels of Nitric Oxide (NO) and S100beta in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Each evaluation was performed sequentially within 120 hours after reperfusion.\nGroup C showed progressive deterioration of motor function which became statistically significant from 48 hours after the onset of reperfusion (P < .05, P < .01, P < .001, P < .001 at 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours, respectively). Compared to Group C, a higher number of viable neurons was observed with less severe spinal cord injury in Group I (P < .01, .05 and .05 at 24, 72, and 120 hours, respectively). TUNEL-positive neurons were also significantly reduced by the administration of IL-1ra (P <.01 and .05 at 24, and 120 hours, respectively). The difference between Group C and Group I with regard to NO was significant at 72 and 120 hours (P < .05), while that in terms of S100beta was significant only at 24 hours (P < .05).\nAdministration of IL-1ra attenuates spinal cord ischemic-reperfusion injury as evidenced by reducing both neuronal necrosis and apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the association between the characteristics of calf muscle hemoglobin oxygen saturation (StO(2)) and exercise performance in patients with intermittent claudication.\nThe study comprised 39 patients with peripheral arterial disease limited by intermittent claudication. Patients were characterized on calf muscle StO(2) before, during, and after a graded treadmill test, as well as on demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, ankle-brachial index (ABI), ischemic window, initial claudication distance (ICD), and absolute claudication distance (ACD).\nCalf muscle StO(2) decreased 72%, from 55% +/- 18% (mean +/- SD) saturation at rest to the minimum value of 17% +/- 19% saturation attained 459 +/- 380 seconds after the initiation of exercise. After exercise, recovery half-time of calf muscle StO(2) was attained at 129 +/- 98 seconds, whereas full recovery to the resting value was reached at 225 +/- 140 seconds. After adjusting for sex, race, and grouping according to the initial decline constant in calf muscle StO(2) during exercise, the exercise time to minimum calf muscle StO(2) was correlated with the ischemic window (r = -0.493, P = .002), ICD (r = 0.339, P = .043), and ACD (r = 0.680, P < .001). After treadmill exercise, the recovery half-time of calf muscle StO(2) was correlated with the ischemic window (r = 0.531, P < .001), ICD (r = -0.598, P < .001), and ACD (r = -0.491, P = .003).\nIn patients limited by intermittent claudication, shorter ICD and ACD values are associated with reaching a minimum value in calf muscle StO(2) sooner during treadmill exercise and with having a delayed recovery in calf muscle StO(2) after exercise.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported recently that resveratrol preconditioning can protect the brain from ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, it was unclear whether resveratrol administration after stroke was beneficial to the delayed phases after focal cerebral ischemia injury. This study investigated the effects and possible protective mechanism of resveratrol on the delayed phase after focal cerebral ischemia injury in mice.\nMice were randomly assigned to five groups according to the time of administration of resveratrol. Control group mice received a corresponding volume of saline solution (0.9% NaCl) containing 20% hydroxypropyl h-cyclodextrin by gavage and were exposed to middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion and reperfusion injury. The treatment groups received resveratrol (50 mg/kg/d, gavage) until day 7. Ischemia group mice received their first dose 5 minutes before MCA ischemia, reperfusion group mice received their first dose 5 minutes before MCA reperfusion, first-day, group mice received their first dose 24 hours after MCA reperfusion, and third-day group mice received their first dose at 72 hours after MCA reperfusion. Brain injury was evaluated by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and neurologic examination 7 days after reperfusion. The microvascular cell number was examined with immunohistochemistry staining. Effect of resveratrol on matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression was investigated with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot.\nThe mean neurologic scores and infarct volumes of the ischemia and reperfusion groups were lower than that of the control group at 7 days after MCA reperfusion (P < .05). Immunohistochemistry staining showed significantly less reduction in the number of microvessels in the cortical area of mice of the ischemia and reperfusion groups compared with controls. The ischemic hemispheres of the ischemia and reperfusion groups showed significantly (P < .05) elevated levels of protein of MMP-2 and VEGF.\nResveratrol administration by gavage provided an important neuroprotective effect on focal cerebral ischemic injury in the delayed phase. The elevated MMP-2 and VEGF levels might be important in the neuroprotective effect of resveratrol administration by inducing angiogenesis.",

The LSA was completely covered in 70 patients (53 men, 13 women), with a mean age of 67 years (range 41-89). Elective revascularization of the LSA was performed in 42 cases, consisting of transposition (n = 5), bypass and ligation (n = 3), or bypass and coil embolization (n = 34). Mean follow-up was 11 months (range, 1-48 months). The chi(2) test was used for statistical analysis.\nIndications for treatment included aneurysm in 47, dissection in 16, transection in 4, pseudoaneurysm in 2, and right subclavian aneurysm in 1, with 47 elective and 23 emergency operations. Aortic coverage extended from the left common carotid artery (LCCA) to the distal arch (n = 29), middle thoracic aorta (n = 9), or celiac artery (n = 32). Operative success was 99%. The 30-day mortality was 4% (intraoperative myocardial infarction, 1; traumatic injuries, 1; visceral infarction, 1). No paraplegia developed. The stroke rate was 8.6%; no strokes were related to LSA coverage because there were no posterior strokes. Stroke rates between the revascularization (7%) and non-revascularization (11%) groups were not significantly different (P = .6). All but one patient fully recovered by 6 months. No left arm symptoms developed in patients with LSA revascularization. All bypasses remained patent throughout follow-up. One complication (2%) resulted in an asymptomatic persistently elevated left hemidiaphragm, likely related to phrenic nerve traction. Left upper extremity symptoms developed in five (18%) patients without LSA revascularization. Two required LSA revascularization, one of which was for acute limb-threatening ischemia. No permanent left upper extremity dysfunction or ischemia developed in any patient.\nZone 2 TEVAR with LSA coverage can be accomplished safely in both elective and emergency settings and with and without revascularization (with the exception of a patent LIMA-LAD bypass). Nevertheless, overall stroke rates are higher compared with all-zone TEVAR. Staged LSA revascularization and even urgent revascularization may be necessary but can be performed without long-term detriment to the left arm.",

The reproducibility of TcPo(2) in terms of interobserver variability was also assessed.\nDiabetic patients had a mean +/- SD TcPo(2) value at the foot of 50.02 +/- 8.92 mm Hg, which was significantly lower compared with 56.04 +/- 8.80 mm Hg in nondiabetic patients (P < .001).

We report the long-term outcomes of this approach.\nPatients undergoing CFA endarterectomy with simultaneous iliac stenting/stent grafting between 1997 and 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. Technical success, clinical and hemodynamic outcomes, and 5-year patency using life-table methodology were determined. Factors associated with reintervention and mortality were determined by logistic regression analysis.\nA total of 171 patients (mean age, 67 +/- 10 years; 38% female; 35% diabetic) underwent 193 CFA endarterectomies and iliac stent/stent grafting. Indications were rest pain (32%), tissue loss (22%), and claudication (46%). External iliac artery (EIA) lesions were present in 39%, and combined common iliac artery (CIA) and EIA lesions were seen in 61% of patients. Complete CIA/EIA occlusions were present in 41% of patients. Stent grafts were used in 41% of patients. Technical success occurred in 98% of patients. Clinical improvement was seen in 92% of patients. Mean ankle-brachial index increased from 0.38 +/- 0.32 to 0.72 +/- 0.24. Median length of stay was 2 days (range, 1-51 days). Thirty-day mortality was 2.3% and 5-year survival was 60%. Five-year primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patencies were 60%, 97%, and 98% respectively. Endovascular reintervention was required in 14% of patients; inflow surgical procedures were required in 10%. By logistic regression analysis, use of stent grafts compared with bare stents was associated with significantly higher primary patency (87% +/- 5% vs 53% +/- 7%; P < .01).\nCombined CFA endarterectomy with iliac intervention yield acceptable long-term results. The use of stent grafts compared with bare stents is associated with improved primary patency.",

External iliac artery (EIA) lesions were present in 39%, and combined common iliac artery (CIA) and EIA lesions were seen in 61% of patients. Complete CIA/EIA occlusions were present in 41% of patients. Stent grafts were used in 41% of patients. Technical success occurred in 98% of patients. Clinical improvement was seen in 92% of patients. Mean ankle-brachial index increased from 0.38 +/- 0.32 to 0.72 +/- 0.24. Median length of stay was 2 days (range, 1-51 days). Thirty-day mortality was 2.3% and 5-year survival was 60%. Five-year primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patencies were 60%, 97%, and 98% respectively. Endovascular reintervention was required in 14% of patients; inflow surgical procedures were required in 10%. By logistic regression analysis, use of stent grafts compared with bare stents was associated with significantly higher primary patency (87% +/- 5% vs 53% +/- 7%; P < .01).",

    "abstract": "The long-term patency of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) suffers from a high incidence of primary failure due to early thrombosis, myointimal hyperplasia at the venous access site, or failure to mature. A multidisciplinary meeting in vascular access surgery was initiated to optimize the timing, indication, type of intervention, and the logistics of AVFs/AVGs during the preoperative and postoperative period. This study evaluated the influence of the new optimized care protocol on the incidence of revisions (surgical and endovascular) and patency rates.\nThis protocol for vascular access surgery of AVFs/AVGs for hemodialysis was introduced in January 2004. It was initiated with the presence of the vascular surgeons, nephrologists, interventional radiologists, dialysis nurses, and the ultrasound technicians. Every patient who needed an AVF/AVG because of long-term treatment of chronic renal failure or awaiting kidney transplantation, or who needed a revision of an AVF/AVG, was discussed. Two groups were compared. Group I patients were treated with an AVF/AVG before the introduction of the new protocol (2001 and 2002). Group II patients were treated with an AVF/AVG after the introduction of the new optimized care protocol (2004 and 2005). Both groups were followed up after 12 months.\nDuring the study period, 146 AVFs/AVGs were attempted, and 111 postoperative revisions were performed to restore primary and secondary patency: 63 in group I (60 surgical, 3 radiology) and 48 in group II (23 surgical, 25 radiology). Significantly more segmental access replacements (P < 0.027) occurred in group I than in group II. Significantly fewer surgical revisions (P < 0.019) and more endovascular balloon angioplasties (P < 0.001) occurred in group II. Significantly higher cumulative primary and secondary patency rates of all AVFs/AVGs (P < 0.001), radial-cephalic direct wrist AVFs (P < 0.001), and brachial-cephalic forearm looped transposition AVGs (P < 0.001) were achieved in group II after follow-up.\nThe new protocol outlined in a bimonthly multidisciplinary meeting for vascular access surgery of AVFs/AVGs for hemodialysis resulted in more effective logistics according to preoperative diagnostics and operation. More importantly, a significant increase in endovascular balloon angioplasties and a significant decrease in surgical revisions was observed, resulting in less patient morbidity. Also, higher primary and secondary patency was achieved after the introduction of the new optimized care protocol.",

    "abstract": "Whether or not to undergo surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and whether to have open or endovascular repair (EVAR), is a complex decision that relies heavily on patient preferences, and yet little is known about the patient perspective on informed consent in this context. This study explores patients' views on their decision-making processes and the quality of surgeon-patient communication during informed consent for AAA repair.\nWe conducted in-depth interviews with AAA patients (n = 20) who underwent open AAA repair, endovascular repair, or declined surgery. Data were independently transcribed and analyzed by a team of individuals with diverse backgrounds, using the constant comparative method of analysis and systematic coding procedures.\nPatients who had seen surgeons from academic, private practice, and VA settings were interviewed.\nPatients' opinions regarding the nature, scope, and content of informed consent for AAA repair.\nWe identified four central themes characterizing patients' experiences with informed consent for AAA repair: 1) patients did not appreciate the scope of their options; 2) patients demonstrated that they were not adequately informed prior to making a decision; 3) patients differed in the scope and content of information they desired during informed consent; and 4) trust in the surgeon had an impact on the informed consent process.\nOur research highlights the limitations of the informed consent encounter in the current clinical context, and points to several ways in which informed consent could be improved.

    "abstract": "Colonic ischemia (CI) is a known complication of both open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Despite a relatively low incidence of 1% to 6%, the associated morbidity and mortality are high. We sought to analyze factors that affect the development of CI on the basis of type of repair as well as associated outcomes from a large nationwide database.\nAll admissions undergoing AAA repair were selected from the 2003 and 2004 Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to compare outcome measures and identify independent predictors of development of colonic ischemic complications.\nWe identified 89,967 admissions for AAA repair (mean age, 69.9 years). Open elective repair was performed in 49% of cases, elective EVAR in 41%, and ruptured aneurysm repair in 9%. The overall incidence of CI was 2.2% (1941 cases); however, the incidence for specific procedures was significantly higher after repair of ruptured aneurysm (8.9%) and open elective repair (1.9%) than after EVAR (0.5%; both P < .001). Patients who developed CI were at increased risk for mortality (37.8% vs 6.7%), had longer hospital stays (21.5 vs 8.1 days), incurred higher hospital charges ($182,000 vs $77,000), and were less likely to be discharged home from hospital (36% vs 71%; all P < .001). Independent predictors of development of CI included ruptured aneurysm (odds ratio [OR] = 6.4), female gender (OR = 1.6) and, in the setting of elective repair, open operation (OR = 3.1). CI was found to be a strong independent predictor of mortality in evaluations of both the entire cohort (OR = 4.5) and the elective open repair and EVAR (OR = 2.4) subgroups.\nCI is significantly more common after open AAA repair and is associated with increased morbidity and a two- to fourfold increase in mortality.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the frequency and nature of incidental findings seen on computed tomography (CT) scans during preoperative and postoperative follow-up in patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nBetween January 1, 2000, and March 1, 2006, 176 consecutive patients who underwent EVAR at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were included in the study if all preoperative and postoperative surveillance CT scans were performed at our institution. Eighty-two patients, 26 women (32%) and 56 men (68%), met this criterion. Their mean age was 76 years (range, 51-103 years). Official CT scan reports were reviewed. Findings were considered primary incidental if they were noted on preoperative CT scans and secondary incidental if they appeared on surveillance CT scans but not on the preoperative study. Primary and secondary incidental findings were considered either benign (eg, gallstones, diverticulosis) or clinically significant if they warranted further workup (eg, suspicious masses or changes suggestive of malignancy, internal or diaphragmatic hernias, and diverticulitis). The median follow-up was 29 months (range, 3-60 months). Each incidental finding was counted only once, on the first scan in which it appeared.\nOf the 82 patients, 73 (89%) had at least one primary incidental finding, and 14 (19%) of these were clinically significant. Secondary incidental findings, many of which were clinically significant, continued to appear throughout the follow-up period. The most common clinically significant primary incidental finding was the presence of a lung mass (n = 4). The most common clinically significant secondary incidental findings were lung mass (n = 6), liver mass (n = 6), and pancreas mass (n = 3). There was a significant difference in the proportion of men to women in the group with clinically significant incidental findings vs the group without clinically significant incidental findings (P = .03959). Differences between the groups with respect to age or aneurysm size were not significant.\nCT scans yielded surprisingly large numbers of both primary and secondary incidental findings, many of which were clinically significant. Primary incidental findings were more common than secondary incidental findings; however, clinically significant findings were found at a consistent rate throughout the study period.",

    "abstract": "With the established computed tomographic (CT)- morphologic parameters, only the relative, but not the individual rupture risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), can be determined. So far, increased aortic 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) metabolism measured by positron emission tomography (PET) has been reported in AAA with increased rupture risk. The aim of the study was to analyze the histopathologic changes in AAA wall correlated with increased FDG uptake for further implications on aortic wall stability and AAA rupture risk.\nFifteen patients with asymptomatic (n = 12) and symptomatic (n = 3) AAA underwent FDG-PET/CT, followed by open AAA repair. FDG-PET/CT was used for precise localization of maximum FDG uptake, and the maximum standard uptake values (SUV(max)) were calculated. Biopsies of the AAA wall were operatively collected from areas with maximum FDG uptake, immunohistologically stained, and semiquantitatively analyzed for inflammatory infiltrates, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 expression, as well as for elastin and collagenous fibers.\nSymptomatic AAA showed significantly increased FDG uptake compared with asymptomatic AAA (SUV(max), 3.5 +/- 0.6 vs 7.5 +/- 3; P < .001). Thus, increased FDG uptake was correlated with higher densities of inflammatory infiltrates (r = +0.87, P < .01) and macrophage and T-cell infiltrations (r = +0.95, P < .01 and r = +0.66, P < .05), with higher MMP-9 expressions (r = +0.86; P < .01), and with reduction of collagen fiber (r = -0.76; P < .01) and VSMCs (r = -0.71; P < .01). Consecutive correlations were found for total inflammatory infiltrates, T lymphocytes, and macrophages with MMP-9 expression (r = +0.79, +0.79 and +0.74; P < .01). Moreover, MMP-9 expression was correlated with decreasing collagen fiber content (r = -0.53, P < .05) and VSMC density (r = -0.57, P < .05).\nMaximum aortic FDG uptake correlated significantly with inflammation, followed by increased MMP expression and histopathologic characteristics of aneurysm wall instability and clinical symptoms. Therefore, FDG-PET/CT might be a new diagnostic technique to study AAA disease in vivo and may contribute to improve prediction of individual AAA rupture risk.",

Although single-center observational studies have revealed acceptable outcomes of combined carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), community-based outcomes have been substantially inferior. Recently, carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been introduced for the management of high-risk patients with carotid stenosis, including those with severe coronary artery disease. This study was undertaken to evaluate the nationwide trends and outcomes of CAS before CABG vs combined CEA and CABG and to assess the risk for adverse events.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to identify patients discharged after concurrent carotid and coronary revascularization procedures. All patients that underwent CAS before CABG and combined CEA-CABG during the years 2000 to 2004 were included. The type of revascularization and major adverse events (ie, in-hospital stroke and death rates) were determined by cross-tabulating discharge diagnostic and procedural codes. Risk stratification was performed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Weighted exact Cochrane-Armitage trend test and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess the association between types of revascularization, comorbidities, complications, and risk-adjusted mortality.\nDuring the 5-year period, 27,084 concurrent carotid revascularizations and CABG were done. Of these, 96.7% underwent CEA-CABG, whereas only 3.3% (887 patients) had CAS-CABG. From 2000 to 2004, the proportion of patients undergoing CAS-CABG vs CEA-CABG did not significantly changed (P = .27). Patients undergoing CAS-CABG had fewer major adverse events than those undergoing CEA-CABG. CAS-CABG patients had a lower incidence of postoperative stroke (2.4% vs 3.9%), and combined stroke and death (6.9% v. 8.6%) than the combined CEA-CABG group (P < .001), although in-hospital death rates were similar (5.2% vs 5.4%). After risk-stratification, CEA-CABG patients had a 62% increased risk of postoperative stroke compared with patients undergoing CAS before CABG (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.5; P = .02). However, no differences in the risk of combined stroke and death were observed (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.9-1.6; P = NS).\nAlthough CAS may currently be performed for high-risk patients, it is still infrequently used in patients who require concurrent carotid and coronary interventions. In the United States, patients who undergo CAS-CABG have significantly decreased in-hospital stroke rates compared with patients undergoing CEA-CABG but similar in-hospital mortality. CAS may provide a safer carotid revascularization option for patients who require CABG.",

    "abstract": "This report summarizes the 30-day and 12-month results of endovascular treatment using the Medtronic Vascular Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, Calif) for patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) who are considered candidates for open surgical repair.\nThe study was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, pivotal trial conducted at 38 sites. Enrollment occurred between December 2003 and June 2005. Standard follow-up interval examinations were prescribed at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. These endovascular results were compared with retrospective open surgical data from three centers of excellence.\nThe Evaluation of the Medtronic Vascular Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System for the Treatment of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms (VALOR) trial enrolled 195 patients, and 189 were identified as retrospective open surgical subjects. Compared with the open surgery group, the VALOR test group had similar age and sex distributions, but had a smaller TAA size. Patients received a mean number of 2.7 +/- 1.3 stent graft components. The diameters of 25% of the proximal stent graft components implanted were <26 mm or >40 mm. Left subclavian artery revascularization was performed before the initial stent graft procedure in 5.2% of patients. Iliac conduits were used in 21.1% of patients. In 33.5% of patients, the bare spring segment of the most proximally implanted device was in zones 1 or 2 of the aortic arch. In 194 patients (99.5%), vessel access and stent graft deployment were successful at the intended site. The 30-day VALOR results included perioperative mortality, 2.1%; major adverse advents, 41%; incidence of paraplegia, 1.5%; paraparesis, 7.2%; and stroke, 3.6%. The 12-month VALOR results included all-cause mortality, 16.1%; aneurysm-related mortality, 3.1%; conversion to open surgery, 0.5%; target aneurysm rupture, 0.5%; stent graft migration >10 mm, 3.9%; endoleak (12.2%), stent graft patency, 100%; stable or decreasing aneurysm diameter, 91.5%; and loss of stent graft integrity, four patients. No deployment-related events or perforation of the aorta by a graft component occurred. The Talent Thoracic Stent Graft showed statistically superior performance with respect to acute procedural outcomes (P < .001), 30-day major adverse events (41% vs 84.4%, P < .001), perioperative mortality (2% vs 8%, P < .01), and 12-month aneurysm-related mortality (3.1% vs 11.6%, P < .002) vs open surgery.\nThe pivotal VALOR 12-month trial results demonstrate that the Medtronic Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System is a safe and effective endovascular therapy as an alternative to open surgery in patients with TAA who were considered candidates for open surgical repair.",

    "abstract": "Dextran-40 is effective in reducing postoperative Doppler-detectable embolization in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Dextrans are thought to have antithrombotic and antiplatelet effects. The mode of action is unclear. In rats, dextran blocks uptake of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) by mannose-binding receptors. Because this would have the effect of enhancing endogenous fibrinolysis, we explored this effect of dextran-40 on fibrinolysis in man.\nTwenty patients undergoing endovascular stenting for abdominal aortic aneurysm were randomized to receive 100 mL of 10% dextran-40 or saline, over 1 hour, during their operation in addition to heparin. Blood samples were taken preoperatively, intraoperatively (immediately after operative procedure), and 24 hours postoperatively. Thrombi were formed in a Chandler loop and used to assess endogenous fibrinolysis over 24 hours, measured as the fall in thrombus weight, and the release of fluorescently labelled fibrinogen from the thrombus. Plasma samples were analyzed for markers of fibrinolysis; plasmin-antiplasmin (PAP), PAI-1, and t-PA, and for functional von Willebrand factor (vWF). Platelet response to thrombin and other agonists was measured by flow cytometry.\nThrombi formed ex vivo from the intraoperative blood samples from the dextran-treated patients exhibited significantly greater fibrinolysis vs preoperative samples, seen both as a significantly greater percentage reduction in thrombus weight (from 34.7% to 70.6% reduction) and as an 175% increase in the release of fluorescence (P < .05). Fibrinolysis returned to baseline levels the next day. No change was seen in the saline-treated group. Plasma levels of PAP and PAI-1 increased significantly postoperatively in the dextran-treated group vs the saline group (P < .05). The postoperative level of functional VWF was significantly lower in the dextran-treated group vs controls. A specific reduction occurred in the platelet response to thrombin, but not to other agonists, in the intraoperative samples from the dextran-treated group (11.1% vs 37.1%; P = .022), which was not seen in the controls.\nThese data are consistent with a rise in plasmin due to dextran blockade of tPA uptake in vivo, leading to enhanced fibrinolysis, cleavage of vWF and of the platelet protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) thrombin receptor. This suggests that dextran exerts a combined therapeutic effect, enhancing endogenous fibrinolysis, whilst also reducing platelet adhesion to vWF and platelet activation by thrombin. The proven antithrombotic efficacy of low-dose dextran in carotid surgery may be applicable to wider therapeutic use.",

    "abstract": "Preservation of spinal cord blood supply during descending thoracic (TAA) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) surgery is mandatory to prevent neurologic complications. Although collateral arteries have been identified occasionally and are considered crucial for maintaining spinal cord function in the individual patient, their critical functionality is poorly understood and very little experience exists with visualization. This study investigated whether the preoperative and postoperative presence or absence of collateral arteries detected by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is related to spinal cord function during the intraoperative exclusion of the segmental supply to the Adamkiewicz artery.\nSpinal cord MRA was used to localize the Adamkiewicz artery and its segmental supplier in 85 patients scheduled for open elective surgery for TAA or TAAA. The segmental artery to the Adamkiewicz artery was inside the cross-clamped aortic area in 55 patients, and spinal cord supply was consequently dependent on collateral supply. In these 55 patients the presence of collaterals originating from arteries outside the cross-clamped aortic segment was related to changes in the intraoperative motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) that occurred before corrective measures. Twenty-one patients returned for postoperative MRA.\nA highly significant (P < .0015) relation was found between the presence of collaterals and intraoperative spinal cord function. In 30 of 31 patients (97%) in whom collaterals were identified, MEPs remained stable. The collaterals in most patients originated caudally to the distal clamp (eg, from the pelvic arteries), which were perfused by means of extracorporeal circulation during cross-clamping. The MEPs declined in 9 of 24 patients (38%) in whom no collaterals were preoperatively visualized. Postoperatively, the 21 patients who had MRA, including 10 in whom preoperatively no collaterals were found, displayed a well-developed collateral network.\nCollateral arteries supplying the spinal cord can be systematically visualized using MRA. Spinal cord blood supply during open aortic surgery may crucially depend on collateral arteries. Preoperatively identified collateral supply was 97% predictive for stable intraoperative spinal cord function. Patients in whom no collaterals can be depicted preoperatively are at increased risk for spinal cord dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "This prospective, observational study evaluated the safety and efficacy of superficial femoral artery autograft reconstruction in the treatment of popliteal artery aneurysms in the absence of a suitable saphenous vein.\nFrom March 1997 to April 2007, data from patients with popliteal artery aneurysms treated by superficial femoral artery reconstruction were prospectively collected in two centers. The procedure was performed through a medial approach. The superficial femoral artery was harvested in the upper third of the thigh and used as the conduit for reconstruction, and the harvested segment was replaced by a polytetrafluoroethylene graft. The patients were observed for survival, limb salvage, and reconstruction patency. The results were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.\nDuring the 10-year study period, 37 popliteal artery aneurysms in 32 patients (all men; median age, 71 years) were treated by reconstruction using the superficial femoral artery. Indications for surgical treatment were symptomatic or complicated aneurysms in 11 (30%). Four (11%) of the 37 popliteal artery aneurysms were thrombosed, and 33 (89%) were patent. At surgery, 35% had a single vessel runoff. Because of acute ischemia, reconstruction was performed as an emergency procedure in three patients (8%). There were no perioperative deaths, early amputations, or early thrombosis. The mean follow-up period was 36 months (range, 7-103 months). Two grafts thrombosed during follow-up. At 3 years, the primary and secondary patency rates were 86% and 96%, and overall limb salvage was 100%. Follow-up duplex ultrasonography did not detect any aneurysmal dilatation of the autograft.\nOur experience shows that superficial femoral arterial reconstruction is a safe and useful treatment option in patients with popliteal artery aneurysms who lack suitable saphenous veins. This reconstruction seems to be a good alternative to prosthetic bypass crossing the knee joint, and our results suggest that this study should be continued.",

At surgery, 35% had a single vessel runoff. Because of acute ischemia, reconstruction was performed as an emergency procedure in three patients (8%). There were no perioperative deaths, early amputations, or early thrombosis. The mean follow-up period was 36 months (range, 7-103 months). Two grafts thrombosed during follow-up. At 3 years, the primary and secondary patency rates were 86% and 96%, and overall limb salvage was 100%. Follow-up duplex ultrasonography did not detect any aneurysmal dilatation of the autograft.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 10% of infrainguinal bypass surgeries are complicated by early conduit failure. The cause is unclear in most cases. A prospective study was conducted to monitor the development and function of platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin antibodies after infrainguinal bypass procedures and to evaluate their clinical significance in early graft occlusion.\nBlood samples were obtained before surgery and at the 7-, 14-, and 28-day postsurgical evaluation. Relevant demographic and laboratory data were collected, and plasma samples were assayed for the presence and function of PF4/heparin-antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a two-point platelet aggregation assay. All tests were performed in duplicate or triplicate.\nOf the 79 patients who were enrolled, 67 reported previous heparin exposure. Six patients (7.6%) tested positive for the presence of PF4/heparin antibodies before surgery with ELISA, and four of these (67%) also had a positive result on the aggregation assay. During the 28-day follow-up, 22 subjects (32%) converted to positive according to the ELISA results; and five (22.7%) of these also tested positive for platelet-activating antibodies. No participants presented with thrombocytopenia or a >/=50% decrease in platelet count during the study period. Early graft occlusion was detected in three patients, all with negative ELISA and functional assay results throughout the study.\nPatients undergoing vascular surgery frequently develop PF4/heparin antibodies, with platelet-activating antibodies detected in up to 11% of these individuals.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate contemporary results of ruptured aortoiliac aneurysms (RAAA) and identify the role of surgeons' annual aortic volume and other prognostic indicators for early outcome.\nA retrospective review identified 213 consecutive patients who presented with an atherosclerotic RAAA without thoracic extension over 6.5 years ending in June 2007. Excluded were 31 ruptures treated by endovascular repair (EVAR) or following previous EVAR, also excluded were two chronic asymptomatic hemodynamically stable ruptures. Ten patients were not treated due to either patient's refusal or prohibitive surgical risk. Demographic, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were collected. Log rank test and Cox proportional hazard model analyses were utilized to identify factors contributing to mortality and morbidity in these patients. Survival rates were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method.\nOne hundred thirty-one males and 39 females with a mean age of 74.5 +/- 8.1 years underwent consecutive RAAA repairs. The operative mortality rate was 38.2% (65/170), including 29 intraoperative deaths. Using multivariate analysis, surgeon's average annual AAA volume (<20/y), advanced age, and postoperative intestinal ischemia were independent predictors of perioperative deaths. Shock on presentation, preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation or free rupture were not. High-volume surgeons (>20 average annual AAA cases/y) had a higher 30-day survival rates (78.4% vs 57.9%, P = .024). Octogenarians had a lower 30-day survival rate of 49.0% vs 70.5% (P = .012). Patients who developed postoperative intestinal ischemia had a lower 30-day survival rate compared with patients without (48.1% vs 15.3%, P = .002). Increased intraoperative fluid and blood product usage was associated with bowel ischemia (P < .05).\nRAAA remains a highly lethal problem. The improved early outcomes of surgeons with high-volume AAA have strong implications for training, emergency staffing needs and alternative treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, the Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative (DOQI) Guidelines have enhanced the longevity of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. Consequently, surgeons are increasingly challenged to provide vascular access for patients in whom options for access in the upper extremity have been expended. This situation is even more problematic in the morbidly obese patient on hemodialysis. Our group previously reported a high rate of infection and need for secondary interventions in obese patients with prosthetic femorofemoral accesses. We now report a series of patients who underwent placement of a prosthetic axilloaxillary loop access. This study presents our technique and evaluates our results, particularly as they relate to the obese patient.\nFrom January 1998 to May 2006, 34 prosthetic axilloaxillary loop accesses were placed in 32 patients with ESRD. Eleven patients (12 accesses) were obese, as defined by a body mass index >/=30 kg/m(2). Median follow-up was 16 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine primary and secondary patency as well as patient survival for the entire cohort and for the obese and nonobese patient cohorts. Survival curves were compared using the log-rank test for equality over strata.\nThe secondary patency rate was 59% at 1 year (median, 18 months). The 1-year patient survival was 69%. Infection occurred in 15% patients. Comparison of the obese vs nonobese cohorts demonstrated no statistically significant difference in 1-year primary patency (36% vs 10%, P = .17) or secondary patency (71% vs 65%, P = .34). There were no infections in the obese cohort.\nThese data show that the prosthetic axilloaxillary loop access has acceptable outcomes and should be considered the tertiary vascular access procedure of choice in the obese patient on hemodialysis.",

Patients who presented with pain, swelling, or signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism of <10 days were included. The DVT was diagnosed with duplex ultrasound (DUS) imaging. Patients were grouped by those having thrombosis in one venous segment (group A) or multiple levels (group B). Patients were treated with heparin and warfarin. Patients with at least 1-year of follow-up with clinical and DUS were included.\nNo difference was found in the duration of signs and symptoms at presentation. The median follow-up was 3.4 years (range, 1.2-7 years). More symptomatic limbs were seen in group B (71 of 79) compared with group A (21 of 41; P < .001).

Limbs with calf DVT that had focal thrombosis were most often asymptomatic. Calf thrombosis in patients with proximal DVT produced the highest prevalence of PTS. Venous claudication was exclusively found in group B and was present only when iliac veins were involved. Recurrent thrombosis had a trend for a higher prevalence in group B (5 of 41 vs 16 of 79, P = .39). Reflux, obstruction, or a combination of the two were more common in group B (61 of 79) vs group A (15 of 41; P < .0001). Limbs with both reflux and obstruction were more likely to develop skin damage (group A, 5 of 6 vs 1 of 35, P < .0001; group B, 24 of 29 vs 5 of 50, P < .0001).\nRecurrent thrombosis and skin damage is more likely to develop in patients with multiple sites of thrombosis than in those with thrombosis in a single vein segment. Patients with reflux and obstruction presented more skin damage than those with reflux or obstruction alone. Involvement of the calf veins in the presence of proximal vein thrombosis increased the likelihood for PTS.",

More symptomatic limbs were seen in group B (71 of 79) compared with group A (21 of 41; P < .001). Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) was more advanced in group B vs group A, including the prevalence of skin damage and ulceration (61 of 79 vs 26 of 41, P < .001; 29 of 79 vs 6 of 41, P = .019, respectively). Limbs with calf DVT that had focal thrombosis were most often asymptomatic. Calf thrombosis in patients with proximal DVT produced the highest prevalence of PTS. Venous claudication was exclusively found in group B and was present only when iliac veins were involved. Recurrent thrombosis had a trend for a higher prevalence in group B (5 of 41 vs 16 of 79, P = .39). Reflux, obstruction, or a combination of the two were more common in group B (61 of 79) vs group A (15 of 41; P < .0001). Limbs with both reflux and obstruction were more likely to develop skin damage (group A, 5 of 6 vs 1 of 35, P < .0001; group B, 24 of 29 vs 5 of 50, P < .0001).",

These lesions have been described originating in the veins of the head, neck, and upper extremities. To our knowledge, there are no reported cases of intravenous capillary hemangioma arising from within a pelvic vein. We report a case of an elderly woman found to have an extensive intravenous lobular capillary hemangioma originating in the internal iliac vein. She was successfully treated with resection, including the tumor and normal iliac vein. Diagnosis of these lesions can be difficult. We describe the utility of duplex ultrasound and magnetic resonance venography in aiding preoperative diagnosis and surgical planning. The diagnosis is ultimately confirmed with histology that demonstrates multiple capillaries lined with flattened endothelial cells grouped in a lobular fashion admixed with fibromyxoid stroma containing collagenous fibers, spindle cells, and mitotic figures. Preoperative work-up should include a duplex ultrasound and magnetic resonance venogram. Treatment should be with resection and specimen processing to rule-out malignant vascular tumors.",

    "abstract": "Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS) is an uncommon congenital disorder of uncertain etiology that comprises the clinical triad of varicose veins, port wine stain, and bony or soft-tissue hypertrophy. The literature suggests that the deep venous system is often under-developed. We propose that duplex venous ultrasound can effectively demonstrate patent deep venous systems in KTS patients with mild to moderate disease, and that endovascular radiofrequency ablation can be utilized in a safe and appropriate therapeutic manner.\nA single center retrospective review of three patients with KTS treated with endovascular radiofrequency ablation of the KT veins and/or great saphenous veins was conducted. Preoperatively, patients underwent both venography and were studied with color flow duplex ultrasound system iU22 with a 7-5 MHz linear array probe (Philips Medical Systems, NA, Bothell, Wash). The anomalous KT veins, great saphenous and saphenous tributaries, and associated incompetent perforators were ablated with radiofrequency catheters (VNUS Medical Technologies, Inc, San Jose, Calif). All the radiofrequency ablations were complimented by ultrasound guided sclerotherapy of the varicose tributaries and when evident, incompetent perforator veins.\nThe diagnostic series of duplex ultrasounds performed on our KTS patients has demonstrated contiguous deep venous systems in the effected extremity and effectively recognized the associated anomalous superficial venous systems. Our treatment resulted in successful occlusion of the incompetent veins in all three patients.\nThe three patients, females aged 39, 19, and 16, presented with port wine stains and many years of leg-swelling and varicose veins that were recalcitrant to conservative treatment measures, including compression stockings and pulsed-dye laser therapy. Venography initially revealed poorly developed deep venous systems. However, venous ultrasound demonstrated patent and competent deep venous systems in all of the affected limbs. Radiofrequency ablations were performed to manage the sequella of venous insufficiency. At short-term follow-up, all patients demonstrated markedly decreased leg pain, edema, and varicose vein bulging.\nThree KTS patients were successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of the incompetent great saphenous and/or anomalous superficial veins. Although the deep veins were poorly visualized on venography, they were clearly demonstrated with duplex ultrasound and functioned adequately once the incompetent superficial veins were ablated.",

The patient had a blood pressure of 80/40 mm Hg. A diagnostic computed tomography angiography revealed a rupture of the thoracic aorta, and a thoracic endograft was sized based on these data. However, the postoperative computed tomography angiography (Riva-Rocci, 164/70 mm Hg) showed an increase in aortic diameters of about 30% at multiple levels. In this patient, with rupture of the thoracic aorta and hypovolemia, the aortic diameter was significantly decreased. This indicates that adequate preoperative sizing for endovascular repair of vascular pathology in patients in shock is complicated.",

We report a case of a 74-year-old man who underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and subsequently femorofemoral bypass placement due to occlusion of the right limb of the endograft. Six months later, he presented with rectal bleeding, weight loss, back pain, and low abdominal pain. Computed tomography revealed extensive abscess formation with air in and around the endograft and psoas muscles, in continuity with destructive spondylodiscitis L3-4. There was a small bowel loop in close proximity to the occluded right leg of the endograft, which was filled with air bubbles. An axillofemoral bypass was created followed by a laparotomy. Intra-operatively, an iliaco-enteral fistula was found. The small bowel defect was sutured, the endograft completely removed, and the infrarenal aorta and both common iliac arteries were closed. Necrotic fragments of the former L3-4 disk were removed. The postoperative course was uneventful. Seven months postoperatively, the patient had recovered well. Iliaco-enteric fistula and spondylodiscitis are rare complications of aortic aneurysm repair. This is the first report of spondylodiscitis after EVAR.",

    "abstract": "This prospective observational study examined the effect of revision surgery in patients who present solely with complicated arteriovenous access (AVA)-related aneurysms.\nThe demographics and comorbid conditions of 44 hemodialysis access patients who presented with complicated true or false AVA-related aneurysms and underwent revision surgery during a 7-year period were prospectively entered into our AVA database. Also recorded were AVA characteristics before and after revision. Arteriovenous access anatomy was evaluated preoperatively using color Doppler ultrasonography, and AVA adequacy was assessed in all patients postoperatively after the first needle puncture and every month thereafter. Postintervention access function and primary patency rates were analyzed. Patency was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between groups of patients with different AVA characteristics before and after revision using the log-rank test.\nThe cases of initial AVA with complicated aneurysms comprised 16 radiocephalic, 8 brachiocephalic, 2 basilic vein transposition, and 18 prosthetic fistulas (7 and 11 of the lower and upper arm, respectively), of which 42 were dysfunctional and 2 had thrombosed early at presentation. Primary indications for revision were danger of aneurysm rupture in 26, duplication in graft aneurysm diameter in 18, painful aneurysm in 12, stenosis due to partial aneurysm thrombosis in 12, shortness of the potential cannulation area in 12, aneurysm enlargement in 4, infected aneurysm in 2, and completely thrombosed aneurysm in 2. The mean postintervention primary patencies were 93%, 82%, 57%, and 32% at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. The outcomes was better in autogenous than prosthetic corrections, in true than false aneurysms, in patients with two or fewer than more than 2 previous AVAs on revised arms, and in forearm than upper-arm corrections (P = .0197, P = .004, P = .0022, and P = .0225, respectively).\nSurgical revision of complicated false and true AVA-related aneurysms reveals acceptable postintervention primary patency rates and therefore is justified. This outcome measure was superior in the following specific groups of corrections: autogenous were better than prosthetic, true aneurysms were better than false aneurysms, patients with one or two previous AVAs in the revised arm were better than those with more than two previous accesses in the revised arm, and finally, forearms were better than those in the upper arm.",

    "abstract": "The use of catheters or prosthetic grafts for vascular access has significantly higher mortality and morbidity risks, in addition to higher costs, than arteriovenous fistulas (AVF). Many patients have a difficult access extremity due to complex medical illnesses, previous vascular access procedures, intravenous catheters, diabetes, vascular disease, female sex, age, and other complicating factors. Transposition AVFs (AVF-T) have been used for these individuals to avoid catheters and grafts. We report our experience with primary and staged basilic vein AVF-Ts and staged brachial vein AVF-Ts.\nFrom our database of consecutive vascular access operations, we reviewed patients from May 2003 to September 2006 for all upper extremity AVF-Ts. A primary AVF-T was used when the basilic vein was continuous with a minimum diameter of 4 mm and of adequate length. When the basilic vein was 2.5 to 4 mm, the procedure was staged. The proximal radial artery was used for inflow, if possible. When the basilic vein was not suitable, a radial vein or brachial vein anastomosis was performed as the first stage of a planned brachial vein AVF-T. The second stage operations of staged AVF-Ts were generally done 4 to 6 weeks after the primary AVF construction. All patients were evaluated with preoperative ultrasound imaging by the operating surgeon.\nFrom a database of 412 consecutive vascular access patients, 78 upper extremity transposition procedures were identified. Of these, 57 patients (73.1%) were women, 44 (56.4%) were diabetic, and 46 (59.0%) had previous access surgery. Fifty-eight operations were staged procedures. The basilic vein was used in 68 AVF-T, the brachial vein in six, and cephalic vein in four. The anastomosis was based on the proximal radial artery in 60 patients. Mean follow-up was 18 months (range, 3-48 months). Primary patency, primary assisted patency, and cumulative patency were 45.7%, 93.5%, and 96.0% at 12 months and 27.6%, 86.5%, and 88.9% at 24 months, respectively. No prosthetic grafts were used in the study period.\nBoth primary and staged AVF-T procedures were successfully used in patients with difficult access extremities. AVF-Ts were durable, although many required an interventional procedure for maturation or maintenance. Cumulative (secondary) patency was 96.0% at 12 months and 88.9% at 24 months. The absence of an adequate basilic vein does not preclude the use of a staged AVF-T because the brachial vein offers a suitable alternative.",

A multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors for amputation and death.\nA total of 220 intra-arterial thrombolysis procedures were performed in 195 patients (46% women). Median age was 73 years. Complete and partial thrombolysis was obtained in 41% and 38%, respectively. Hemorrhagic complications were documented in 33%, but only 6% (13 of 220) were interrupted. The amputation rate was 26% and mortality was 35% during a median follow-up of 32 months. Degree of lysis (hazard ratio [HR], 4.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-9.7; P < .001), motor deficit at admission (HR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.8-8.7; P = .001), foot ulcers (HR, 7.2; 95% CI, 2.2-23.4; P = .001), and ischemic heart disease (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-4.8; P = .024) remained as independent factors associated with amputation. Renal insufficiency (HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.4-4.2; P = .003), ischemic heart disease (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.7; P = .007), cerebrovascular disease (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.0; P = .009), foot ulcers (HR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.2-8.6; P = .019), and acute lower limb ischemia (HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.1-10.1; P = .028) remained as independent factors associated with mortality.\nThrombolysis is successful, with few major complications in most patients with lower limb ischemia. Patients with ischemic heart disease and foot ulcers are at higher long-term risk for both amputation and death. A lesser degree of lysis and motor deficit were associated with higher amputation rates. The presence of such negative prognostic factors may help clinicians to deny further invasive vascular treatment.

    "abstract": "To assess expansion rate of common iliac artery aneurysms (CIAAs) and define outcomes after open repair (OR) and endovascular repair (EVAR).\nClinical data of 438 patients with 715 CIAAs treated between 1986 and 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. Size, presentations, treatments, and outcomes were recorded. Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank tests and chi2 test were used for analysis.\nInterventions for 715 CIAAs (median, 4 cm; range, 2-13 cm) were done in 512 men (94%) and 26 women (6%); 152 (35%) had unilateral and 286 (65%) had bilateral CIAAs. Group 1 comprised 377 patients (633 CIAAs) with current or previously repaired abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Group 2 comprised 15 patients (24 CIAAs) with associated internal iliac artery aneurysm (IIAA). Group 3 comprised 46 patients (58 isolated CIAAs). Median expansion rate of 104 CIAAs with at least two imaging studies was 0.29 cm/y; hypertension predicted faster expansion (0.32 vs 0.14 cm/y, P = .01). A total of 175 patients (29%) were symptomatic. The CIAA ruptured in 22 patients (5%, median, 6 cm; range, 3.8-8.5 cm), and the associated AAA ruptured in 20 (4%). Six (27%) ilioiliac or iliocaval fistulas developed. Repairs were elective in 396 patients (90%) and emergencies in 42 (10%). OR was performed in 394 patients (90%) and EVAR in 44 (10%). The groups had similar 30-day mortality: 1% for elective, 27% for emergency repairs (P < .001); 4% after OR (elective, 1%; emergency, 26%), and 0% after EVAR. No deaths occurred after OR of arteriovenous fistula. Complications were more frequent and hospitalization was longer after OR than EVAR (P < .05). Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range, 1 month-17.5 years). The groups had similar 5-year primary (95%) and secondary patency rates (99.6%). At 3 years, secondary patency was 99.6% for OR and 100% for EVAR (P = .66); freedom from reintervention was similar after OR and EVAR (83% vs 69%, P = .17), as were survival rates (76% vs 77%, P = .70).\nThe expansion rate of CIAAs is 0.29 cm/y, and hypertension predicts faster expansion. Because no rupture of a CIAA <3.8 cm was observed, elective repair of asymptomatic patients with CIAA >or=3.5 cm seems justified. Although buttock claudication after EVAR remains a concern, results at 3 years support EVAR as a first-line treatment for most anatomically suitable patients who require CIAA repair. Patients with compressive symptoms or those with AVF should preferentially be treated with OR.",

    "abstract": "The number of thoracic aortic endovascular procedures is increasing rapidly, and the clinical outcome largely depends on the underlying aortic pathology. When primary stent grafting is unsuccessful, secondary endovascular solutions are most often feasible. However, in recurrent endovascular failure without further minimally invasive options, conservative treatments or conversion to open surgery are the only remaining therapeutic strategies.\nIn our experience, 106 patients received thoracic aortic endovascular treatment. Five of these patients and three from other centers underwent conversion to open repair because of 4 type Ia endoleaks (3 thoracic aortic aneurysms, 1 traumatic rupture), 2 retrograde type A dissections, 1 type Ib endoleak with contained rupture, and 1 secondary false aneurysm rupture due to stent graft migration. The latter four were surgical emergencies; the other four were urgent or elective procedures. Three patients underwent supracoronary arch replacement through sternotomy. One patient had arch and proximal descending aortic replacement, three had hemiarch and descending aortic replacement, and one had descending aortic replacement through left thoracotomy. Five stent grafts were totally removed, and three endografts were left in situ. All conversions were performed according to a protocol including total extracorporeal circulation (n = 7) or left heart bypass (n = 1), cerebrospinal fluid drainage and monitoring motor-evoked potentials, transcranial Doppler, and electroencephalography.\nAll patients survived the surgical procedure. Six patients had an uneventful postoperative course, whereas necrotic cholecystitis developed in one patient who required cholecystectomy and prolonged intensive care stay. One polytrauma patient died from secondary rupture due to prosthesis infection 24 days after stent graft explantation. No stroke, paraplegia, renal failure, or other major complication occurred. With a mean follow-up of 14 months (range, 4-71 months), seven patients are alive without any sign of recurrent aortic problems.\nFailure of thoracic endovascular aortic repair comprises a new aortic pathology. Secondary endovascular treatment is feasible in most patients; however, some patients will require open surgery to repair failures of thoracic endovascular aortic treatment. These procedures constitute a large surgical trauma and require an extensive protocol, including extracorporeal circulation, neuromonitoring, and adjunctive modalities to provide organ protection. We recommend that these procedures be performed in centers with experience and the infrastructure to offer these protective measures.",

    "conclusions": "Failure of thoracic endovascular aortic repair comprises a new aortic pathology. Secondary endovascular treatment is feasible in most patients; however, some patients will require open surgery to repair failures of thoracic endovascular aortic treatment. These procedures constitute a large surgical trauma and require an extensive protocol, including extracorporeal circulation, neuromonitoring, and adjunctive modalities to provide organ protection. We recommend that these procedures be performed in centers with experience and the infrastructure to offer these protective measures.",

    "abstract": "A drawback of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is the need for ongoing surveillance. Follow-up schedules including 1-, 6-, and 12-month computed tomography (CT) established by regulatory trials have been carried into clinical practice without critical assessment. The utility of a 6-month CT, with its associated radiation exposure and contrast toxicity, obtained after a normal result at 1-month CT has not been established.\nAll EVAR patients from 1996 to 2004 at one institution with complete local 1-year follow-up were reviewed for clinically significant CT findings at 1, 6, and 12 months. Before 2000, all patients underwent 1-, 6-, and 12-month CT. In 2000, a policy of omitting the 6-month CT in patients who had a normal result on the 1-month scan was adopted.\nDuring the study period, 573 patients underwent EVAR, and 376 patients who had complete local 1-year follow-up were included in this review. All had a 1-month CT scan and the result was abnormal in 40 (10.6%): five had type 1 leaks (1.3%), 34 had type 2 leaks (9.0%), and one had a type 3 leak (0.3%); all were followed with 6-month CT. The 1-month CT scan result was normal for 336 (89.4%) patients. Of these, group I (130 patients, 67 treated after 2000) underwent routine 6-month CT, with only two abnormalities noted (1.5%); both were type 2 endoleaks not associated with sac growth. No 6-month CT in this group demonstrated findings warranting intervention. The 6-month CT was omitted in group II (206 patients, all treated after 2000), and follow-up was only at 1 year. In this group, no patient's management would have been altered by findings on a 6-month CT. No patient in either group experienced aneurysm sac growth by 1 year. Clinical complications occurred in three group I patients (2.3%): seroma, limb occlusion, and main body thrombosis. Only one group II patient (0.5%) experienced a complication <or=1 year, a limb occlusion at 9 months.\nAfter EVAR, a 6-month CT after a normal 1-month CT result does not identify any clinically significant findings warranting intervention and can be omitted safely from the follow-up schedule.",

    "abstract": "The Leapfrog Group established evidence-based standards for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, including targets for case volume and perioperative beta-blocker usage. The purpose of this study was to determine whether meeting these benchmarks correlated with improved patient outcomes over time.\nWe studied California hospitals that responded to consecutive Leapfrog Group Hospital Quality and Safety Surveys between 2000 and 2005. Survey results of compliance with Leapfrog standards were linked to patient outcomes for AAA repair using the California state discharge database for the corresponding years. A random-effects Poisson regression analysis was performed to measure the effect of meeting beta-blocker and case volume standards on hospital mortality and average length of stay after elective open and endovascular AAA repair (EVAR) during the early (2000-2002) and later (2003-2005) phase of Leapfrog implementation.\nAmong 140 hospitals that performed open AAA repair, 25 (17.4%) met the Leapfrog case volume standard, 32 (22.2%) were compliant with routine perioperative beta-blocker use, 5 hospitals (3.5%) met both criteria, and 78 control hospitals failed to meet either standard. After controlling for temporal differences in hospital and patient characteristics, hospitals that implemented a policy for perioperative beta-blocker usage were found to have an estimated 51% reduction of in-hospital mortality (relative risk, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.99; P < .05) after open AAA repair cases compared with control hospitals over time. There was no improvement in mortality outcomes over time, however, after open AAA repair in hospitals meeting case volume standards. Among 111 California hospitals in which EVAR was performed, there was an estimated 61% reduction of in-hospital mortality over time (relative risk, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-1.80) among hospitals meeting Leapfrog case volume standards compared with control hospitals, although these results did not reach statistical significance. Finally, there was no reduction in length of hospital stay over time after either EVAR or open AAA repair for hospitals meeting Leapfrog standards compared with control hospitals.\nThis population-based study supports the effectiveness of meeting Leapfrog AAA repair standards towards improving mortality outcomes over time and suggests that their impact depends upon procedure type. Further studies are needed to help promote the standardization of evidence-based measures that may improve vascular surgery outcomes.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in concert with serial contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) surveillance adversely impacts renal function. Our primary objectives were to assess serial renal function in patients undergoing EVAR and open repair (OR) and to evaluate the relative effects of method of repair on renal function.\nA thorough retrospective chart review was performed on 223 consecutive patients (103 EVAR, 120 OR) who underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Demographics, pertinent risk factors, CT scan number, morbidity, and mortality were recorded in a database. Baseline, 30- and 90-day, and most recent glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were calculated. Mean GFR changes and renal function decline (using Chronic Kidney Disease [CKD] staging and Kaplan-Meier plot) were determined. EVAR and OR patients were compared. CKD prevalence (>or=stage 3, National Kidney Foundation) was determined before repair and in longitudinal follow-up. Observed-expected (OE) ratios for CKD were calculated for EVAR and OR patients by comparing observed CKD prevalence with the expected, age-adjusted prevalence.\nThe only baseline difference between EVAR and OR cohorts was female gender (4% vs 12%, P = .029). Thirty-day GFR was significantly reduced in OR patients (P = .047), but it recovered and there were no differences in mean GFR at a mean follow-up of 23.2 months. However, 18% to 39% of patients in the EVAR and OR groups developed significant renal function decline over time depending on its definition. OE ratios for CKD prevalence were greater in AAA patients at baseline (OE 1.28-3.23, depending upon age group). During follow-up, the prevalence and severity of CKD increased regardless of method of repair (OE 1.8-9.0). Deterioration of renal function was independently associated with age >70 years in all patients (RR 2.92) and performance of EVAR compared with OR (RR 3.5) during long-term follow-up.\nCompared with EVAR, OR was associated with a significant but transient fall in GFR at 30 days. Renal function decline after AAA repair was common, regardless of method, especially in patients >70 years of age. However, the renal function decline was significantly greater by Kaplan-Meier analysis in EVAR than OR patients during long-term follow-up. More aggressive strategies to monitor and preserve renal function after AAA repair are warranted.",

    "abstract": "We postulated that ligation of a consistent perforating venous branch at the elbow would improve distention and flow in the superficial veins about the elbow. This would also lesson the likelihood of arterial steal enabling a favorable outcome following a brachial artery medial antecubital or cephalic vein arterio-venous fistula (AVF).\nPressure measurements were made from the radial artery after side-to-side brachial artery antecubital or cephalic vein AVF in 20 patients. Clamping of the perforating vein increased radial artery pressure significantly indicating that a considerable amount of flow from the side-to-side AVF was diverted into the deep system and away from the accessible superficial veins. Encouraged by this finding, we studied the outcome of brachial cephalic or brachial antecubital AVF with ligation of the deep branch in 134 patients who were not candidates for radio-cephalic AVF. The end point of the study was successful hemodialysis using the fistula.\nOf the 134 patients treated, 24 died, and 11 were lost to follow-up and were censored from analysis of fistula performance at that time point. The primary fistula success rate was 89.7% +/- 2.66% and 83.7% +/- 3.5% at 1 and 2 years by life table analysis. No patient developed significant arterial steal or venous hypertension.\nWe recommend this simple one-stage procedure for patients requiring hemodialysis whose cephalic vein at the wrist is unsuitable.",

This report examines the clinical results for the vascular surgery subgroup of patients enrolled in a larger double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial, which evaluated the comparative safety and efficacy of rThrombin and bovine plasma-derived thrombin (bThrombin) when used as adjuncts to surgical hemostasis.\nData from the 164 vascular patients who underwent either a peripheral arterial bypass (PAB) or arteriovenous graft (AV) procedure are included in this analysis. Time to hemostasis at proximal and distal anastomotic sites at 1.5-, 3-, 6-, and 10-minute intervals was determined by procedure (PAB or AV) and overall (PAB + AV). Baseline and day 29 immunologic sera were analyzed. The incidences of postoperative adverse events were compared between treatment groups. Categorical adverse events were evaluated in relation to thrombin product antibody formation.\nPatients were randomized to either bThrombin (n = 82) or rThrombin (n = 82). Procedures included PAB (n = 88) and AV (n = 76). The bThrombin and rThrombin groups were well matched for demographics and baseline characteristics. A comparable incidence of anastomotic hemostasis was observed in both treatment groups at 10 minutes (94% bThrombin, 91% rThrombin). The incidence of hemostasis was lower at all time points for PAB procedures compared with AV procedures. In the PAB group, a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving rThrombin (55%) achieved hemostasis at 3 minutes compared with bThrombin (39%; P < .05). Adverse event profiles and laboratory findings were similar between groups. No patients in the rThrombin group developed anti-rThrombin product antibodies at day 29, whereas 27% of patients in the bThrombin group developed antibodies to bThrombin product (P < .0001).\nrThrombin or bThrombin used as a hemostatic ancillary for anastomotic bleeding was equally effective at 10 minutes; however, rThrombin compared with bThrombin may provide a more rapid onset of hemostasis at 3 minutes in PAB procedures. Adverse events were similar between the two thrombins. In patients undergoing vascular surgery, both treatments were similarly well tolerated, although rThrombin demonstrated a superior immunogenicity profile.",

The bThrombin and rThrombin groups were well matched for demographics and baseline characteristics. A comparable incidence of anastomotic hemostasis was observed in both treatment groups at 10 minutes (94% bThrombin, 91% rThrombin). The incidence of hemostasis was lower at all time points for PAB procedures compared with AV procedures. In the PAB group, a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving rThrombin (55%) achieved hemostasis at 3 minutes compared with bThrombin (39%; P < .05). Adverse event profiles and laboratory findings were similar between groups. No patients in the rThrombin group developed anti-rThrombin product antibodies at day 29, whereas 27% of patients in the bThrombin group developed antibodies to bThrombin product (P < .0001).",

    "abstract": "To describe our experiences with the treatment of visceral artery aneurysms (VAA) by transcatheter coil embolization and to propose indications for treating VAA by this method.\nWe treated 22 patients with VAA by coil embolization; 9 had splenic-, 7 renal-, 4 pancreaticoduodenal arcade-, and 2 proper hepatic artery aneurysms. All nine splenic artery aneurysms patients presented with chronic hepatitis-C; four had hepatocellular carcinoma. Of the seven renal artery aneurysms patients, four were hypertensive and three had rheumatoid arthritis. Both pancreaticoduodenal arcade artery aneurysms patients manifested severe stenosis of the celiac axis. Our transcatheter coil embolization procedure includes coil embolization and coil-packing of the aneurysmal sac, preserving the native arterial circulation.\nTranscatheter coil embolization with aneurysm packing was technically successful in 16 (72.7%) of the 22 patients and the native arterial circulation was preserved. Postprocedure angiograms confirmed complete disappearance of the VAA. In four of the nine splenic artery aneurysm patients, the native arterial circulation was not preserved. In one renal artery aneurysm patient, stenosis at the aneurysmal neck necessitated placement of a stent before transcatheter coil embolization. Magnetic resonance angiographs obtained during the follow-up period (mean 27 months) demonstrated complete thrombosis of the VAA in all 22 patients. Infarction occurred in one splenic- and two renal artery aneurysms patients; the latter developed flank pain and fever after the procedure.\nTranscatheter coil embolization is an effective alternative treatment for patients with saccular and proximal VAA. In particular, the isolation technique using coil embolization is advantageous in splenic artery aneurysm patients.",

    "abstract": "The remodeling of vein bypass grafts after arterialization is incompletely understood. We have previously shown that significant outward lumen remodeling occurs during the first month of implantation, but the magnitude of this response is highly variable. We sought to examine the hypothesis that systemic inflammation influences this early remodeling response.\nA prospective observational study was done of 75 patients undergoing lower extremity bypass using autogenous vein. Graft remodeling was assessed using a combination of ultrasound imaging and two-dimensional high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging.\nThe vein graft lumen diameter change from 0 to 1 month (22.7% median increase) was positively correlated with initial shear stress (P = .016), but this shear-dependent response was disrupted in subjects with an elevated baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level of >5 mg/L. Despite similar vein diameter and shear stress at implantation, grafts in the elevated hsCRP group demonstrated less positive remodeling from 0 to 1 month (13.5% vs 40.9%, P = .0072). By regression analysis, the natural logarithm of hsCRP was inversely correlated with 0- to 1-month lumen diameter change (P = .018). Statin therapy (beta = 23.1, P = .037), hsCRP (beta = -29.7, P = .006), and initial shear stress (beta = .85, P = .003) were independently correlated with early vein graft remodeling. In contrast, wall thickness at 1 month was not different between hsCRP risk groups. Grafts in the high hsCRP group tended to be stiffer at 1 month, as reflected by a higher calculated elastic modulus (E = 50.4 vs 25.1 Mdynes/cm2, P = .07).\nEarly positive remodeling of vein grafts is a shear-dependent response that is modulated by systemic inflammation. These data suggest that baseline inflammation influences vein graft healing, and therefore, inflammation may be a relevant therapeutic target to improve early vein graft adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting is a relatively new intervention for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis, and the long-term outcomes and complications are therefore yet to be determined. In one surgeon's practice, it was found that a stent fracture was the etiological factor for recurrent stenosis. A retrospective study was therefore performed with the hypothesis that carotid stent fractures are common. The aims were to determine prevalence of fractures in this surgeon's series, risk factors, and most importantly, clinical relevance.\nPatients from one surgeon's private practice who had carotid stenosis deemed suitable for intervention (>80% asymptomatic, >70% symptomatic, 50% to 70% if an ulcerated lesion) and had suitable aortic and carotid morphology for carotid stenting between March 2004 and December 2006 were included. To enhance the quality of the measurement, two vascular surgeons and one radiologist examined the films independently to determine if there was a fracture present. Given that this was a retrospective study, there was no preconceived sample size determined.\nFracture prevalence was found to be 29.2% or 14 out of 48 stents. Restenosis occurred in 21% of those stents with a detected fracture, after an average follow-up of 15 months. Several anetiological factors are proposed, with a finding in this series, of a strong and significant association between the presence of calcified vessels and the presence of fractures (odds ratio 7.7; standard error 5.6; 95% confidence interval 1.9-32.0, P =.003).\nAlthough this is a small study, it demonstrates that carotid stent fractures do exist, and importantly, not all of them are benign. Therefore, the authors recommend regular surveillance with plain radiography in addition to duplex ultrasonography to enable early detection of fracturing. Following detection, institution of increased surveillance frequency and/or any appropriate intervention can be implemented, to aid in the prevention of complications resulting from restenosis should it become apparent.",

    "abstract": "Radiofrequency and laser vein treatment, which entail preservation of the saphenous confluence, have called into question the dogma of ligation of all tributaries at the sapheno-femoral confluence (SFC), so called \"crossectomy\". Nevertheless, crossectomy is still done when saphenous vein stripping is chosen for varicose vein treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate results after stripping procedures in which the SFC was preserved.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study for which limbs treated for varicose veins by surgical stripping of the great saphenous vein and preservation of the SFC were studied. All limbs had a preoperative duplex examination and showed SFC and truncal incompetence of the great saphenous vein. Periodic postoperative standing duplex ultrasound and clinical examinations were carried out, and results were recorded and analyzed retrospectively.\nA total of 195 lower limbs were operated on in 151 patients (128 women and 25 men) aged from 22 to 88 years (mean age 56.8). The preoperative diameter of the SFC ranged from 4.7 to 17 mm (mean 9.5 mm). The preoperative CEAP class distribution was C1 1.5%, C2 82.1%, C3 6.7%, and C4-C6 9.7%. Preoperative symptoms were present in 61.8% of cases. Postoperative thrombosis of the SFC was observed in one case with an extension to the deep femoral vein and pulmonary embolization at 1 month. Recovery was complete. At a mean of 24.4 months postoperatively (median 27.3 months, range 8 to 34.8), persistent SFC reflux was observed in only two cases (1.8%) and a SFC neovascularization in one case (0.9%). Recurrence of varicose veins appeared in seven cases (6.3%) but in conjunction with SFC reflux in only one case. Post treatment 83.9% of limbs were converted to CEAP clinical class 0 to 1 and significant symptom improvement was observed in 91.3% of cases with an aesthetic benefit in 95.5%.\nPreservation of the SFC during saphenous stripping gave good results with regard to hemodynamics and neovascularization on the SFC, varicose vein recurrence, improvement of symptoms, and aesthetic appearance for legs with a median follow-up of 27.3 months.",

    "abstract": "The American Vascular Association/Lifeline Foundation is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. This remarkable two-decade journey represents a cumulative effort by the leaders and members of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS). For the historical record, we would like to chart the sequence of events leading to various programs. In 1986, the Executive Council of SVS approved the formation of an Education/Research Foundation, from which the Lifeline Foundation evolved, with the mission to support the career development of young research-oriented vascular surgeons. Since that time, Lifeline has awarded 141 Student Fellowships, 21 Wylie Traveling Fellowships, 17 Mentored Clinical Scientist Development (K08) Awards, and three Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development (K23) Awards. In 2001, the American Vascular Association (AVA) was established under the aegis of American Association for Vascular Surgery (formerly International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery-North American Chapter). In 2004, with the merger of the SVS and the American Association of Vascular Surgery into a single entity (SVS), Lifeline and the AVA merged into a single foundation, the AVA. As AVA/Lifeline is poised to launch a campaign for an endowment fund, we hope this report will let the members of the SVS know what has been accomplished, what we plan to do, and, most importantly, what we need to do in the future.",

    "abstract": "Evidence regarding the influence of cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and patient characteristics on the growth of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is limited. We assessed, in an observational cohort study, rupture rates, risks of mortality, and the effects of cardiovascular risk factors and patient demographics on growth rates of small AAAs.\nBetween September 1996 and January 2005, 5057 patients with manifest arterial vascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors were included in the Second Manifestation of ARTerial disease (SMART) study. Measurements of the abdominal aortic diameter were performed in all patients. All patients with an initial AAA diameter between 30 and 55 mm were selected for this study. All AAA measurements during follow-up until August 2007 were collected. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to calculate the effects of demographic patient characteristics, initial AAA diameter, and cardiovascular risk factors on AAA growth.\nIncluded were 230 patients, with a mean age of 66 years and 90% were male. Seven AAA ruptures (six fatal) occurred in 755 patient years of follow-up (rupture rate 0.9% per patient-year). In 147 patients, AAA measurements were performed for a period of more than 6 months. The median follow-up time was 3.3 years (mean 4.0, range 0.5 to 11.1 years, standard deviation (SD) 2.5). Mean AAA diameter was 38.8 mm (SD 6.8) and mean expansion rate 2.5 mm/y. Patients using lipid-lowering drugs had a 1.2 mm/y (95% confidence interval [CI] -2.34 to -0.060 mm/y) lower AAA growth rate compared to nonusers of these drugs. Initial AAA diameter was associated with a 0.09 mm/y (95% CI 0.01 to 0.18 mm/y) higher growth rate per millimetre increase of the diameter. No other factors, including blood lipid values, were independently associated with AAA growth.\nLipid-lowering drug treatment and initial AAA diameter appear to be independently associated with lower AAA growth rates. The risk of rupture of these small abdominal aortic aneurysms was low, which pleads for watchful waiting.",

Seven AAA ruptures (six fatal) occurred in 755 patient years of follow-up (rupture rate 0.9% per patient-year). In 147 patients, AAA measurements were performed for a period of more than 6 months. The median follow-up time was 3.3 years (mean 4.0, range 0.5 to 11.1 years, standard deviation (SD) 2.5). Mean AAA diameter was 38.8 mm (SD 6.8) and mean expansion rate 2.5 mm/y. Patients using lipid-lowering drugs had a 1.2 mm/y (95% confidence interval [CI] -2.34 to -0.060 mm/y) lower AAA growth rate compared to nonusers of these drugs. Initial AAA diameter was associated with a 0.09 mm/y (95% CI 0.01 to 0.18 mm/y) higher growth rate per millimetre increase of the diameter. No other factors, including blood lipid values, were independently associated with AAA growth.",

    "abstract": "Intermittent claudication is the primary symptom of peripheral arterial disease, affecting between 1 and 3 million Americans. Symptomatic improvement can be achieved by endovascular revascularization, but such procedures are invasive, expensive, and may be associated with procedural adverse events. Medical treatment options, including claudication medications and supervised exercise training, are also known to be effective, albeit also with associated limitations. The CLEVER (Claudication: Exercise Vs. Endoluminal Revascularization) study, funded by the Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the relative efficacy, safety, and health economic impact of four treatment strategies for people with aortoiliac peripheral arterial disease and claudication. The treatment arms are: (1) optimal medical care (claudication pharmacotherapy); (2) primary stent placement; (3) supervised exercise rehabilitation; and (4) combined stenting with supervised exercise rehabilitation. The CLEVER study is a 5-year randomized, controlled clinical trial to be conducted at approximately 25 centers in the United States that will monitor 252 patients and their responses to treatment during an 18-month follow-up period. The primary end point is change in maximum walking duration on a graded treadmill test. Secondary end points include the change at 18 months in maximum walking duration from baseline, comparisons of free-living daily activity levels assessed by pedometer, health-related quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Other analyses include the effect of these treatment strategies on anthropomorphic and physiologic variables, including body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, pulse pressure, and resting pulse as well as biochemical markers of cardiovascular health, including fasting lipids, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and hemoglobin A 1c values.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the clinical outcome, morphologic changes, and behavior of acute and chronic type B aortic dissections after endovascular repair and evaluated the extent of dissection and diameter changes in the true (TL), false (FL), and whole lumen (WL) during follow-up.\nFrom May 2000 to September 2006, preprocedural and follow-up computed tomography scans were evaluated in 106 patients. Indices of the TL (TLi) and FL (FLi) were calculated at the proximal (p), middle (m), and distal (d) third of the descending thoracic aorta by dividing the TL or FL diameter by the WL. Analyses were by paired t test and chi2.\nStent grafts were used to treat 106 patients (mean age, 55 years, 70% men) with acute 59 (55.7%) and chronic 47 (44.3%) lesions. The entry site was successfully covered in 100 patients. The incidences of paraplegia and paresis were 2.8% and 1.0%. Mortality was 7.5% (8 patients), including two intraoperative deaths of contained ruptures. Seven (6.6%) early endoleaks occurred. At a mean follow-up of 15.6 months, TLi improved from 0.45 to 0.88 in the proximal third (p/3), from 0.42 to 0.81 in the middle third (m/3), and from 0.44 to 0.74 in the distal third (d/3), demonstrating expansion of the TL. Two patients had decrease in TL due to endoleak needing reintervention. The FLi decreased from 0.41 to 0.06 in p/3, from 0.44 to 0.10 in the m/3, and from 0.42 to 0.21 in the d/3, indicating FL shrinkage. Changes in the TLi and FLi were statistically significant. The decrease in the WL after repair was statistically significant in the proximal and middle aorta. Fourteen patients (13.2%) had increase in WL; seven required a second intervention. FL thrombosis occurred in 69 (65.1%). During follow-up, 36 (36.9%) patients had no retrograde flow, with complete shrinkage of the FL. The FL completely shrank in 28 patients (26.4%) despite retrograde flow. The FL increased in eight patients (7.5%); five needed reintervention. Thrombosis of FL was statistically significant with acute dissections and when dissection remained above the diaphragm (type IIIA; P = .001 and P = .0133).\nRemodeling changes were seen when the entry tear was covered. The fate of the FL was determined by persistent antegrade flow and the level of the retrograde flow. Endografting for thoracic type B dissection was successful and promoted positive aortic remodeling changes.",

The primary outcome variable was death <or=30 days of operation or before hospital discharge. We determined the effect of total hospital volume on operative mortality for all types of repair and for endovascular and open repair separately. All analyses were adjusted for patient risk using logistic regression.\nThe proportion of abdominal aortic aneurysms repaired with an endovascular approach increased from 27% to 39% during the 3-year study period. Hospital volume was significantly related to operative mortality in all comparisons. Mortality rates were 80% higher at hospitals in the lowest vs the highest quartile of total volume (odds ratio [OR], 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-2.04) when considering all types of repair together. A similar relationship between total hospital volume and mortality was found when separately examining open repair (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.33-1.73) and endovascular repair (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.32-2.22). Higher-volume hospitals were more likely to use the endovascular approach. The highest-volume hospitals used the endovascular approach 44% of the time compared with only 18% at the lowest-volume hospitals. This greater use of the endovascular procedure at high-volume hospitals accounted for 37% of the difference in mortality between high- and low-volume hospitals.\nAs the endovascular repair becomes more widespread, the relationship between hospital volume and operative mortality still remains. High-volume hospitals are more likely to use the endovascular approach, and this explains a significant portion of the observed impact of hospital volume on mortality.",

Patients were assessed on PAD-specific measures consisting of ankle-brachial index (ABI), initial claudication distance, absolute claudication distance, physical function measures, health-related quality of life, and calf blood flow and transcutaneous oxygen tension responses after 3 minutes of vascular occlusion.\nInitial claudication distance (mean +/- SD) progressively declined (P = .019) in those with three (203 +/- 167 m), four (124 +/- 77 m), and five (78 +/- 57 m) metabolic syndrome components, and absolute claudication distance progressively declined (P = .036) in these groups as well (414 +/- 224 m vs 323 +/- 153 m vs 249 +/- 152 m, respectively). Furthermore, compared with patients with only three components of metabolic syndrome, those with all five components had impaired values (P < .05) for peak oxygen uptake, ischemic window, 6-minute walk distance, self-perceived walking ability and health, daily physical activity, health-related quality of life on six of eight domains, calf hyperemia, and calf ischemia after vascular occlusion. Abdominal obesity was the predictor (P < .05) of exercise performance during the treadmill and 6-minute walk tests, as well as physical activity. Elevated fasting glucose was the predictor (P < .05) of peripheral vascular measures, self-perceived walking ability and health, and health-related quality of life.\nPAD patients with more metabolic syndrome components have worsened intermittent claudication, physical function, health-related quality of life, and peripheral circulation. Abdominal obesity and elevated fasting glucose are the metabolic syndrome components that are most predictive of these outcome measures. Aggressively treating these metabolic syndrome components may be particularly important in managing symptoms and long-term prognosis of PAD patients.",

    "abstract": "Although mortality and complication rates for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) have declined over the last 20 years, operative complication rates and perioperative mortality are still high, specifically for repair of ruptures. The goal of this study was to determine the influence of insurance type and ethnicity while controlling for the influences of potential confounders on procedure selection and outcome following endovascular AAA repair (EVAR).\nUsing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, we identified patients who underwent EVAR repair of ruptured and elective infrarenal AAA, between 1990 and 2003. Insurance type and ethnicity were analyzed against the primary outcome variables of mortality and major complications. The potential confounders of age, gender, operative location, diabetes, and Deyo index of comorbidities, were controlled.\nBivariate analyses demonstrated significant differences between insurance types and ethnicity and mortality and complications. Patients who were self pay had adverse outcomes in comparison to Private insurance. Whites encountered less perioperative mortality and postoperative complications than Blacks and Hispanics.\nAfter controlling for previously identified associative factors for AAA outcome, ethnicity and insurance type does influence EVAR surgical outcome. Subsequent studies that break down emergent repair vs elective surgery and that longitudinally stratify delay in surgery, or time to admission may be useful.",

    "abstract": "Wounding patterns, methods of repair, and outcomes from femoropopliteal injury have been documented in recent civilian literature. In Operation Iraqi Freedom, as in past conflicts, these injuries continue to be a therapeutic challenge. Therefore, the objective of the current study is to document the pattern of femoropopliteal injuries, methods of repair, and early outcomes during the current military campaign in Iraq.\nFrom September 1, 2004, to April 30, 2007, all vascular injuries arriving at the Air Force Theater Hospital (the central echelon III medical facility in Iraq; equivalent to a civilian level I trauma center), Balad Air Base, Iraq were prospectively entered into a registry. From this, injuries involving the lower extremities were reviewed.\nDuring the 32-month study period, 9289 battle-related casualties were assessed. Of these, 488 (5.3%) were diagnosed with 513 vascular injuries, and 142 casualties sustained 145 injuries in the femoropopliteal domain. Femoral level injury was present in 100, and popliteal level injury occurred in 45. Injuries consisted of 59 isolated arterial, 11 isolated venous, and 75 combined. Fifty-eight casualties were evacuated from forward locations. Temporary arterial shunts were placed in 43, of which 40 (93%) were patent on arrival at our facility. Our group used shunts for early reperfusion before orthopedic fixation, during mass casualty care, or autogenous vein harvest in 11 cases. Arterial repair was accomplished with autogenous vein in 118 (88%), primary means in nine (7%), or ligation in seven (5%). Venous injury was repaired in 62 (72%). Associated fracture was present in 55 (38%), and nerve injury was noted in 19 (13%). Early limb loss due to femoropopliteal penetrating injury occurred in 10 (6.9%). Early mortality was 3.5% (n = 5).\nFemoropopliteal vascular injury remains a significant reality in modern warfare. Femoral injuries appear more prevalent than those in the popliteal region. Early results of in-theater repair are comparable with contemporary civilian reports and are improved from the Vietnam era. Rapid evacuation and damage control maneuvers such as temporary shunting and early fasciotomy assist timely definitive repair and appear effective.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) has become widely accepted in the elective setting but remains controversial for emergency repair of ruptured aneurysms (rAAA). We sought to examine the national trends in use and associated outcomes with EVAR.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to analyze all admissions for rAAA from 2001 through 2004. Nationwide temporal trends and demographics using weighted samples were evaluated. Focused univariate and multivariate analyses comparing outcomes from open repair and EVAR were done for the years 2003 and 2004.\nThere were 28,123 admissions for rAAA, with a stepwise decline in admissions from 2001 to 2004. Use of EVAR increased significantly from 6% of all emergency repairs in 2001 to 11% in 2004 (P < .01). Mortality for EVAR declined significantly from 43% to 29% (P < .01), but mortality with open repair showed no change (40% to 43%). From the 2003 to 2004 data set, 949 EVAR and 8982 open repairs were identified. Compared with open repair, the EVAR patients had lower mortality (31% vs 42%), shorter hospital stay (6 vs 9 days), and were more likely to be discharged to home (59% vs 37%, all P < .01). The total hospital charges for EVAR and open repair were similar (dollars 71,428 vs $74,520, P = .59). Mortality for EVAR was significantly higher at nonteaching hospitals compared with teaching centers (55% vs 21%, P < .01) and at nonteaching centers, even exceeding that of open repair (46%). Regression modeling confirmed the overall benefits of EVAR as well as the worse outcomes at nonteaching facilities after adjusting for patient comorbidities, disease severity, and hospital or system covariates.\nEndovascular repair is being increasingly used in the emergency management of ruptured AAA, with steadily decreasing mortality during the study period. Endovascular AAA repair is associated with improved mortality and outcomes compared with open repair, but results in nonteaching centers are substantially worse than those in teaching hospitals.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of congenital venous malformations poses a major clinical challenge. Great successes have been achieved with ethanol sclerotherapy in most lesions; however, severe complications are more likely to occur when more ethanol is used.\nThis study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a new sclerotherapy treatment that uses absolute alcohol and bleomycin A5. We evaluated our experience to present a safe treatment method for venous malformations.\nThe study population comprised 201 patients. Before treatment, lesions were categorized according to magnetic resonance imaging features: 120 patients had limited venous malformations, and 81 had infiltrating venous malformations. Percutaneous sclerotherapy was performed by direct injection of absolute alcohol and bleomycin A5 under fluoroscopy. The mean dose of the two medicines was 3.4 mL and 3.7 mg, respectively. We investigated 592 sclerotherapy sessions. A retrospective study was performed of medical records and color photographs and magnetic resonance imaging before and after treatment The mean follow-up was 29 months (range, 12-65 months).\nAfter embolization of the drainage vein with ethanol, a subsequent sclerosis therapy with bleomycin A5 was judged beneficial in 196 of 201 patients. Among the 196 responders, 56 showed disappearance of their chief symptoms, 42 showed improvement to nearly normal, and 62 showed marked improvement. The best response to our treatment was among the patients with limited venous malformations, with 114 (95%) showing at least marked improvement. Complications were tissue necrosis in 6 sessions, peripheral nerve palsy in 5, pigmentation in 10, blistering in 5, and 87 sessions resulted in transient side effects related to bleomycin A5, such as fever and gastrointestinal irritation. All were self-limited. No major complications such as cardiopulmonary collapse or pulmonary fibrosis were observed.\nPercutaneous sclerotherapy of venous malformations using absolute ethanol and bleomycin A5 is safe and effective. The simplicity, speed, and safety of sclerotherapy, combined with the quality and stability of the outcome achieved with our novel procedure, may make the technique the choice for treatment of venous malformations.",

    "abstract": "Suprarenal clamping in abdominal aortic surgery is associated with a significant risk of postoperative renal failure, general morbidity, and mortality. Arterial access for temporary shunting in these patients is difficult, and arterial perfusion techniques are typically complex. This study evaluated if renal perfusion with venous blood using a minimal pump setup and intermediate-level heparinization prevents a decline in postoperative renal function in patients requiring suprarenal clamping for aortic reconstructive surgery.\nRenal perfusion was achieved using a roller pump supplied with venous blood from a central venous catheter under medium-level heparinization to feed two perfusion balloon catheters. The calculated glomerular filtration rate was observed for 10 postoperative days and compared with the rate in patients with suprarenal clamping without renal perfusion.\nFrom 2001 to 2007, 158 patients underwent surgical reconstruction involving the pararenal aorta through a midline abdominal incision. Renal perfusion was started in 2006 and was always attempted if suprarenal clamping was anticipated preoperatively. Twenty-six patients received renal perfusion, and 132 also requiring suprarenal clamping did not. Of the latter, 109 were included in the control group. Five patients died <or=30 days (3.7%), one in the perfusion group. On average, there was a postoperative loss of renal performance in both groups. Dialysis was required postoperatively in 13 patients without renal perfusion, 4 of them long term (3.7%), but not in patients with renal perfusion. The reduction in glomerular filtration rate at 10 days in the nonperfused group was significantly higher than in the perfused group (7.24 vs 0.89 mL/min) despite a significantly longer suprarenal clamp time in the latter (25.5 vs 45.5 minutes). Multivariate analysis showed a significant reduction in the loss of glomerular filtration rate with perfusion (P = .007) if clamp time and preoperative renal function were taken into account. Patients with preoperative renal impairment showed the greatest benefit from the perfusion.\nThe setup for renal perfusion with venous blood during suprarenal clamping was simple and safe. Perfusion significantly reduced the reduction of renal function in the immediate postoperative period, suggesting that clamp time may thus be safely be extended to allow for complex reconstruction of the pararenal aortic segment. The benefit was most marked for patients with preoperative renal impairment.",

Multivariate analysis showed a significant reduction in the loss of glomerular filtration rate with perfusion (P = .007) if clamp time and preoperative renal function were taken into account. Patients with preoperative renal impairment showed the greatest benefit from the perfusion.",

    "abstract": "To validate the use of a novel mathematical algorithm applied to digital imaging and communication in medicine (DICOM) computed tomography (CT) data to automate the generation of complex endovascular graft planning.\nAn algorithm was developed enabling the creation of patient-specific mathematical model based upon DICOM CT data to allow for detailed efficient geometric analysis with repeatable results. This algorithm was applied to high resolution DICOM CT datasets of 15 patients, selected at random from 350 patients with aneurysms involving the visceral arteries. The longitudinal and rotational relationships of the visceral vessels were determined by the algorithm. For comparison purposes, the same measurements were acquired manually using centerline of flow software by a blinded investigator. The distance between the renal arteries, and location of the renal origins calculated with each method were then compared.\nAutomated results were readily created for all 15 randomly selected patients. The measured versus calculated mean inter-renal artery distances were exceptionally close, differing by a mean of only 1.3 mm with a maximal range of 3.0 mm. The rotational position of the renal origins differed by only 10.5 degrees of arc (21 clock-face minutes) on average and by 32.5 degrees in the worst case.\nThe generation of an automated mathematical model to represent complex aortic geometry is feasible and reproducible in the context of high-resolution CT data. This process has been validated in 15 patients, where results corresponded with manual measurements that were used to successfully implant customized devices that accommodate the imaged vessels. Additional attributes include the expression of the 3D aorta in a compact form (on the order of kilobytes) for purposes of data storage, transfer, and other manipulations.\nThe construct of mathematical representation of patient specific anatomy from CT data is both feasible and applicable, allowing for automated endograft device design even in the setting of markedly tortuous anatomy where the repair must incorporate major aortic branches. The process has been validated in 15 patients, where results corresponded with manual measurements that were used to successfully implant customized devices that accommodate the imaged vessels. The application of this technology must now be studied in a prospective manner and incorporated into a system users may readily apply to patients undergoing evaluation. Additional attributes of a mathematical representation of the arterial tree include the 3D expression from a very compact set of parameters (on the order of kilobytes) for purposes of data storage, transfer, and other manipulations.",

    "abstract": "Neointimal hyperplasia is strikingly suppressed in an endothelium injury model in mice deficient in the growth factor midkine. Knockdown of midkine expression by means of antisense oligonucleotide or small interfering RNA has been shown to lead to suppression of neointimal hyperplasia in a balloon injury model and a rabbit vein graft model; therefore, midkine is an essential factor for neointimal hyperplasia. These findings, however, do not necessarily apply to the function of midkine in vascular stenoses such as in-stent restenosis, because human vascular stenosis is often accompanied by atherosclerosis.\nWe investigated midkine expression in the neointima induced by implantation of a bare metal stent in the atheromatous lesions of hypercholesterolemic rabbits. We analyzed midkine expression during a THP-1 cell differentiation and in peritoneal macrophages exposed to low-density lipoprotein or oxidized low-density lipoprotein.\nMidkine expression reached the maximum level within 7 days after stenting and was detected in infiltrating macrophages. Differentiation of THP-1 cells to macrophage-like cells did not trigger midkine expression. Neither low-density lipoprotein nor oxidized low-density lipoprotein enhanced midkine expression in peritoneal macrophages that had been activated by thioglycollate, although these cells expressed a significant amount of midkine.\nThe results indicate that macrophages are the major source of midkine in the atherosclerotic neointima. The amount of midkine expressed in macrophages may be sufficient (ie, further enhancement of the expression is not necessary) for the pathogenesis, because oxidized low-density lipoprotein stimulation did not induce the midkine expression.\nThe growth factor midkine is induced during vascular stenosis in mouse and rat models with normal diet. Knockdown of midkine expression suppresses neointimal hyperplasia. The vascular response after stenting differs from that after balloon injury in that the inflammation is more prolonged and the accumulation of macrophages is more abundant in stent-injured vessel. We found here that macrophages are the major source of midkine in the atherosclerotic neointima of in-stent restenosis in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. Our data suggest that midkine has an important role in in-stent restenosis of atherosclerotic vessels and is a candidate molecular target to prevent in-stent restenosis.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the possibility of restoring a physiologic vascular wall using undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) seeded on a polyurethane vascular prosthesis.\nUndifferentiated MSCs were seeded on a vascular prosthesis and implanted into Wistar male rats (weight, 350 g) to investigate differentiation into smooth muscle cells and to determine graft endothelialization in vivo.\nSeeded or nonseeded grafts were surgically implanted. Undifferentiated MSCs were first labelled for green fluorescent protein. After 2 weeks in vivo, MSC that were initially self-expanded on the graft in a monolayer were organized in a multicellular layer mimicking media of aortic adjacent wall. They coexpressed green fluorescent protein and smooth muscle proteins that were not present before the in vivo engraftment, indicating that in vivo conditions induced smooth muscle protein maturation. Undifferentiated MSC showed an electrophysiologic profile quite different than mature smooth muscle cells. In both in vitro- and in vivo-differentiated MSCs, adenosine triphosphate, an IP(3)-dependent agonist, induced an increase in calcium similar to that which occurred in mature smooth muscle cells. However, MSCs failed to respond to caffeine, a ryanodine receptor activator, indicating the absence of mature calcium signaling, and finally, contraction was absent. Endothelialization attested by immunohistology and scanning electron microscopy was greater in MSC-seeded grafts that prevent thrombosis.\nOnly partial smooth muscle cell differentiation of MSCs resulted when seeded on vascular grafts, but MSCs spontaneously restore a media-like thick wall. Mesenchymal stem cells have a positive impact on in vivo endothelialization in rats that supports their potential for use in vascular surgery.\nThrombosis of vascular prostheses is a major complication of surgery. We showed on rat aorta that mesenchymal stem cells seeded on polyurethane patch restore endothelium. It also induced incomplete smooth muscle differentiation.

    "abstract": "Suprarenal fixation is widely used in endovascular aneurysm repair. Numerous small, underpowered studies have concluded that it does not increase the risk of renal impairment compared with infrarenal fixation. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that renal infarction is more common with suprarenal fixation, but the effect on renal function remains unclear.\nElectronic abstract databases, article reference lists, and conference proceedings were searched for series reporting renal function data after suprarenal fixation. There was considerable study heterogeneity with respect to key factors such as pre-existing renal dysfunction and length of follow-up. Authors were contacted to obtain individual patient data for a pooled reanalysis using standardized criteria.\nOf 46 potentially relevant citations, only 11 were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Complete data sets were available for four studies (1065 patients), with a median follow-up of 33 months. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for postoperative renal impairment in the suprarenal fixation and infrarenal fixation groups and compared by the log-rank test. Median time free of renal impairment was 38.5 months in the infrarenal fixation group compared with 32.4 months in the suprarenal fixation group (P = .0038). However, to account for significant methodologic differences, further analysis was required using a Weibull regression model fitted in open Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling (BUGS). The pooled hazard ratio for deterioration of renal function after suprarenal fixation was 0.6 (95% confidence interval, 0.3-10).\nCurrently available data are insufficient to determine the precise effect of suprarenal fixation on medium-term renal function. Conventional Kaplan-Meier analysis of the pooled data set suggested that suprarenal fixation increased the risk of renal dysfunction; however, the effect disappeared when sophisticated statistical modelling was performed to account for study heterogeneity. A randomised controlled trial of suprarenal fixation may resolve this issue.",

This study documented long-term functional outcomes after open TAA repair.\nThe Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36-Item Survey (SF-36) was administered to 134 survivors (83 men, 51 women; mean age, 69.5 years) of TAA repair at a mean follow-up from surgery of 60 +/- 38.7 months. Raw scores were compared against cohorts adjusted for age and comorbidity (cardiovascular disease). Assessed was the influence of preoperative and intraoperative factors, as well as postoperative complications on long-term quality of life (QOL).\nRaw scores for the eight SF-36 domains and the composite physical and mental component scores were lower (P < .01) in the TAA cohort compared with an age-adjusted reference population. Female gender and age >75 years decreased the physical functioning (P = .02) and role physical (P = .04) domains compared with male gender and patients <65 years old. Previously recognized systemic vascular disease lowered QOL in three SF-36 domains: general health (P = .013), social functioning (P = .003), and role emotional (P = .003); systemic vascular disease also showed a strong trend toward reduction in physical functioning (P = .09) compared with patients without systemic vascular disease. Neither TAA extent (I to IV) nor elective vs urgent/emergency operation influenced long-term QOL in our cohort. Patients with postoperative paraplegia, cerebrovascular accident/cardiac event, and those requiring reoperation showed lower scores in the physical functioning (P = .036), general health (P = .02), and Mental Health (P = .04) domains. Increased length of stay negatively impacted long-term QOL. The TAA cohort and the cardiovascular disease cohort had similar SF-36 scores for four domains (general health, bodily pain, vitality, and social functioning) and physical component scores. The cardiovascular disease group had higher scores in the physical functioning, role physical, role emotional, and mental health domains, and in mental component scores (P < .01).\nPermanent loss of functional capacity, measured at a mean of 5 years postoperatively, occurs rarely in survivors of TAA repair. Further studies are needed to define the role of hybrid or endovascular strategies, including their impact on long-term functional outcome compared with open TAA repair.",

Operative mortality at 30 days was 2.8%. The mean age of women was 3 years older than men, and mortality at 30 days for women was 5.7% compared with 2.2% for men (P = .18).

    "abstract": "Controversy regarding the efficacy of duplex ultrasound surveillance after infrainguinal vein bypass led to an analysis of patient and bypass graft characteristics predictive for development of graft stenosis and a decision of secondary intervention.\nRetrospective analysis of a contemporary, consecutive series of 353 clinically successful infrainguinal vein bypasses performed in 329 patients for critical (n = 284; 80%) or noncritical (n = 69; 20%) limb ischemia enrolled in a surveillance program to identify and repair duplex-detected graft stenosis. Variables correlated with graft stenosis and bypass repair included: procedure indication, conduit type (saphenous vs nonsaphenous vein; reversed vs nonreversed orientation), prior bypass graft failure, postoperative ankle-brachial index (ABI) < 0.85, and interpretation of the first duplex surveillance study as \"normal\" or \"abnormal\" based on peak systolic velocity (PSV) and velocity ratio (Vr) criteria.\nOverall, 126 (36%) of the 353 infrainguinal bypasses had 174 secondary interventions (endovascular, 100; surgery, 74) based on duplex surveillance; resulting in 3-year Kaplan-Meier primary (46%), assisted-primary (80%), and secondary (81%) patency rates. Characteristics predictive of duplex-detected stenosis leading to intervention (PSV: 443 +/- 94 cm/s; Vr: 8.6 +/- 9) were: \"abnormal\" initial duplex testing indicating moderate (PSV: 180-300 cm/s, Vr: 2-3.5) stenosis (P < .0001), non-single segment saphenous vein conduit (P < .01), warfarin drug therapy (P < .01), and redo bypass grafting (P < .001). Procedure indication, postoperative ABI level, statin drug therapy, and vein conduit orientation were not predictive of graft revision. The natural history of 141 (40%) bypasses with an abnormal first duplex scan differed from \"normal\" grafts by more frequent (51% vs 24%, P < .001) and earlier (7 months vs 11 months) graft revision for severe stenosis and a lower 3-year assisted primary patency (68% vs 87%; P < .001). In 52 (15%) limbs, the bypass graft failed and 20 (6%) limbs required amputation.\nThe efficacy of duplex surveillance after infrainguinal vein bypass may be enhanced by modifying testing protocols, eg, rigorous surveillance for \"higher risk\" bypasses, based on the initial duplex scan results and other characteristics (warfarin therapy, non- single segment saphenous vein conduit, redo bypass) predictive for stenosis development.",

    "abstract": "Proliferation of endovascular techniques with perceived reduction in treatment morbidity repetitively question the precept that surgical endarterectomy is the preferred treatment for occlusive disease of the common femoral artery (CFA). This study details a contemporary experience with common femoral endarterectomy (CFE) with and without concomitantly performed endovascular therapies.\nTechnical, hemodynamic, and clinical success of CFE performed between 2002 and 2005 were determined according to the Society of Vascular Surgery reporting standards. Primary and assisted patencies of the CFA segment, freedom from reintervention in the ipsilateral limb, and survival were assessed using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate factors associated with patency and survival.\nCFE was performed on 65 limbs in 58 patients (mean age 71 +/- 10; male 77%; diabetes 28%; creatinine >/= 1.5 mg/dL 19%). Forty-four cases (68%) were performed for claudication, and 21 cases (32%) for critical limb ischemia. Thirty-seven cases (57%) were performed as a hybrid procedure wherein concomitant endovascular interventions were performed. Twenty iliac (TASC II A-30%; B-35%; C-20%; D-15%) and 25 femoropopliteal (TASC II A-24%; B-60%; C-12%; D-4%) lesions were treated. Technical success was achieved in 100% of the cases. Hemodynamic success was achieved in 95% of the cases with mean postoperative increase in ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.24 +/- 0.24. All but one patient (98.5%) had improvement in symptoms and/or ABI. Average hospital stay was 3.2 days (range 1-12 days). There were 3 (5%) major complications requiring reintervention (early failure secondary to untreated inflow lesion, hematoma, and wound infection), six (9%) minor complications which were treated conservatively (five wound infections, one lymph leak), and no perioperative mortality. With a mean follow-up period of 27 months (range 1-58 months), 1- and 5-year primary patencies were 93% and 91%, respectively. Assisted patency was 100% at both time points. There was no difference in patencies between CFE performed alone or as a hybrid procedure. Multivariate analysis showed congestive heart failure (CHF) as the only predictor of primary failure (odds ratio [OR] 18.5 [2.6-142.9]; P = .004). Freedom from reintervention in the ipsilateral limb was 82% at 1 year and 78% at 5 years, with CHF again as the only predictor of reintervention (OR 5.3 [1.4-19.6]; P =.012). Survival was 89% at 1 year and 70% at 5 years. There were no amputations.\nThese data suggest CFE should remain the standard of care for occlusive disease of the CFA. Its safety and efficacy establish a standard for comparison with emerging endovascular therapies.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular stent graft repair of a traumatic thoracic aortic disruption (TTAD) is rapidly becoming an accepted alternative to open surgical repair. The use of currently approved thoracic stent grafts especially in younger patients with small, \"steep,\" tapered aortas, remains a concern due to the acute thoracic endograft collapse and enfolding. The objective of this study, the largest report to date, was to evaluate the mid-term results of TTAD treated with abdominal aortic \"stacked\" extension cuffs, with follow-up extending to 41 months.\nThirty-one patients with multi-system trauma (age range, 15 to 61; mean 31.4 years) were seen after motor vehicle accidents between January 1, 2003 and July 1, 2007. Chest x-ray findings warranted thoracic CT scans, which revealed disruptions of the thoracic aorta. Intra-operative arteriograms in all patients and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) (n = 17) delineated the extent of the aortic injuries. The aortic length from the subclavian artery to the injury averaged 2.5 cm (range, 1.5 to 4.0 cm). The repairs were performed with Gore (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) (n = 15), Aneuryx (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif) (n = 15), and Zenith (Cook, Inc., Bloomington, Ind) (n = 1) Aortic Extension Cuffs. A femoral artery approach was used in 27 patients and a supra-inguinal retroperitoneal iliac approach in four. All patients underwent thoracic CT scans during follow-up.\nIn all patients, the stent-graft cuffs successfully excluded the TTAD: 21 patients had 2 cuffs, 9 had 3 cuffs, and 1 had 4 cuffs. The aorta adjacent to the injury mean diameter was 18.5 mm (range, 17-24 mm). No subclavian arteries were covered. Two patients required an additional cuff for exclusion of the Type I endoleaks at the distal attachment site within 6 weeks of initial endograft repair. There were no procedure-related deaths; 2 patients died of other injuries. At follow-up, extending to 41 months (range, 3 to 41 months), two pseudo-aneurysms occurred which required open operative repair: 1 due to infection (4 months) and a leaking pseudoaneurysm (14 months). A CT scan in all other survivors demonstrated no device-related complications, endoleaks, or cuff migrations.\nStent-graft repair of TTAD is technically feasible. The technique of \"stacked\" aortic cuffs provides an acceptable option when urgent therapy is needed, when patients are deemed high-risk for open operative repair, or until thoracic endografts are designed which can safely treat focal, smaller aortic diameter injuries.",

The aorta adjacent to the injury mean diameter was 18.5 mm (range, 17-24 mm). No subclavian arteries were covered. Two patients required an additional cuff for exclusion of the Type I endoleaks at the distal attachment site within 6 weeks of initial endograft repair. There were no procedure-related deaths; 2 patients died of other injuries. At follow-up, extending to 41 months (range, 3 to 41 months), two pseudo-aneurysms occurred which required open operative repair: 1 due to infection (4 months) and a leaking pseudoaneurysm (14 months). A CT scan in all other survivors demonstrated no device-related complications, endoleaks, or cuff migrations.",

    "abstract": "Lower extremity chronic venous disease is due to venous hypertension resulting from reflux and/or obstruction. Studies of venous valvular function have validated and quantified valve closure times defining normal and abnormal valve function, and investigators have categorized the amount of venous reflux with validated criteria. However, hemodynamics of venous outflow obstruction remains poorly defined. The purpose of this study is to assess whether chronic venous disease alters arterial inflow at rest or during hyperemic limb challenge, and whether there are differences in patients with primary chronic venous insufficiency (1 degrees CVI) versus those with postthrombotic venous disease.\nTwenty-two normal limbs and 32 limbs in patients with chronic venous disease (C-3 or greater) were examined between September 2006 and January 2008. Chronic venous disease patients consisted of 22 postthrombotic patients and 10 with 1 degrees CVI. Arterial inflow was measured at rest using venous occlusion plethysmography and after induced arterial inflow using postocclusive reactive hyperemia (PORH). Volume changes were recorded with volume plethysmography. A minimum of 10 minutes elapsed between the resting and PORH measurements of arterial inflow.\nResting arterial inflow was greater in patients with 1 degrees CVI when compared to normal patients (2.81 vs 1.26, P = .008) and to patients with postthrombotic venous disease (2.81 vs 1.13, P = .03). There was a 7.3-fold increase in maximal arterial inflow in normal patients during PORH versus a 4.8-fold increase in patients with postthrombotic venous disease (P = .015). Patients with 1 degrees CVI had a marked attenuation of maximal arterial inflow during hyperemic limb challenge, demonstrating only a twofold increase relative to their baseline resting arterial inflow (P = .08).\nIncreases in arterial inflow during a hyperemic limb challenge are less robust in patients with postthrombotic venous disease than in normal volunteers. These data suggest that the pain of venous claudication may in part be due to a diminished arterial inflow response.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze outcomes of surgical management for popliteal artery aneurysms (PAA).\nThis is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data regarding operations for PAA obtained from 123 United States Veterans Affairs Medical Centers as part of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression were used to characterize 33 risk factors and their associations with 30-day morbidity and mortality. Survival and amputation rates, observed at one and two years after surgery, were subject to life-table and Cox regression analyses.\nThere were 583 operations for PAA in 537 patients during 1994-2005. Almost all were in men (99.8%) and median age was 69 years (range, 34 to 92 years). Most had multiple co-morbidities, 88% were ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) class 3 or 4, and 81% were current or past smokers (median pack-years = 50). Only 16% were diabetic. Serious complications occurred in 69 (11.8%) cases, of which 37 (6.3%) required arterial-specific reinterventions. Eight patients died within 30 days, a mortality of 1.4%. Risk factors associated with increased complications included: African-American race (odds ratio [OR] 2.8 [95% confidence interval 1.5-5.2], P = .002), emergency surgery (OR 3.8 [2.0-7.0], P < .0001), ASA 4 (OR 1.9 [1.1-3.5], P = .04), dependent functional status (OR 2.5 [1.4-4.7], P = .004), steroid use (OR 3.2 [1.2-8.7], P = .03), and need for intraoperative red blood cell transfusion of any quantity (OR 6.3 [3.5-11.2], P < .0001). Independent predictors for complications in the multivariate model were dependent functional status (adjusted OR 2.1 [1.1-4.3], P = .049) and intraoperative transfusion (adjusted OR 4.5 [2.3-8.9], P = .0002). Postoperative bleeding complications within 72 hours independently predicted early amputation (adjusted OR 25.5 [1.7-393], P = .02). Unadjusted patient survival was 92.6% at one year and 86.1% at two years. Limb salvage in surviving patients was 99.0% at 30 days, 97.6% at one year, and 96.2% at two years. Dependent preoperative functional status was the only factor predictive of worse two-year limb salvage (adjusted OR 4.6 [1.9-10.9], P = .001), but remained high at 88.2% versus 97.1% in independent patients.\nSurgical intervention for PAA is associated with low operative mortality and offers excellent two-year limb salvage, even in high-risk patients. Patients' preoperative functional status and perioperative blood transfusion requirements were the most predictive indicators of negative outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a prevalent health condition affecting up to 14% of men and 6% of women. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) compared with open surgical repair (OSR) in patients at a high risk of surgical complications.\nPatient-level cost and outcome data from a 1-year prospective observational study conducted at London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, Canada, was used to determine the incremental cost per life-year gained and the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of EVAR compared with OSR in patients with an AAA >5.5 cm and a high risk of surgical complications. The analysis was taken from a societal perspective and the time horizon was 1 year. To measure sampling uncertainty on costs and effects, nonparametric bootstrap techniques were applied. Uncertainty results were expressed using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Extrapolations of the 1-year results to a 5-year time horizon were conducted in sensitivity analyses.\nBetween August 11, 2003, and April 3, 2005, 192 patients at a high risk of surgical complications were enrolled: 140 received EVAR and 52 OSR. Point estimates during a 1-year period showed that EVAR dominated OSR for high-risk patients in terms of incremental cost per life-year gained and incremental cost per QALYs. However, bootstrap estimates for the two cost-effectiveness measures indicated there was a great deal of uncertainty regarding the costs and the QALYs and less uncertainty regarding life-years gained. If society was willing to pay $50,000 per life-year gained or per QALY gained, the probability of EVAR being cost-effective was found to be 0.76 and 0.55, respectively. Five-year extrapolations indicated that EVAR was cost-effective compared with OSR.\nAccording to this 1-year observational study, EVAR may be a cost-effective strategy compared with OSR for high-risk patients. Longer-term data are needed to decrease the uncertainty associated with the results.",

    "abstract": "The Hardman index, which has five variables, has been recommended as a predictor of outcome after open repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAAs). It has been reported that the presence of three or more variables is uniformly fatal. The aim of this study was to test the same model in an independent series of RAAA patients undergoing endovascular repair.\nA consecutive series of 41 patients undergoing endovascular repair for RAAA during an 8-year period was analyzed retrospectively. Thirty-day mortality and patient variables, including the five Hardman risk factors of age >76 years, serum creatinine >190 micromol/L, hemoglobin <9 g/dL, loss of consciousness, and electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of ischemia, were recorded. The Hardman index and a revised version of the index with four variables (without ECG ischemia) were calculated and related to clinical outcome.\nOperative mortality was 41% (17 of 41). On univariate analysis, only age >76 years (P = .01) and the use of local anesthesia (P < .0001) were statistically significant. Loss of consciousness (P = .05) showed a trend toward a higher mortality, albeit not statistically significant. On multivariate analysis, the use of local anesthesia was the only significant predictor of survival (odds ratio [OR], 0.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.003-0.25, P = .001). Again, loss of consciousness showed an association with a higher chance of dying but did not achieve statistical significance (OR, 6.30; 95% CI, 0.93-42.51, P = .059). The original and revised versions of the Hardman index were both significantly associated with death (P = .02 and P = .001, chi(2) test for trend). The cumulative effect of 0, 1, 2, and >/=3 risk factors on mortality was 0%, 27%, 36%, and 71% for the original index, and 12.5%, 21%, 60%, and 78% for the revised version, respectively. Four and two patients with a score of >/=3 in each version of the index survived endovascular repair.\nThe Hardman index, with or without incorporating ECG ischemia, seems to be a simple and useful predictive tool in patients undergoing endovascular repair of RAAA, with the mortality rate increasing along with the Hardman score. However, the index cannot be used to accurately identify patients with no chance of survival after endovascular repair.",

On multivariate analysis, the use of local anesthesia was the only significant predictor of survival (odds ratio [OR], 0.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.003-0.25, P = .001). Again, loss of consciousness showed an association with a higher chance of dying but did not achieve statistical significance (OR, 6.30; 95% CI, 0.93-42.51, P = .059). The original and revised versions of the Hardman index were both significantly associated with death (P = .02 and P = .001, chi(2) test for trend).

    "abstract": "Large variations in the intervention rates for ruptured and nonruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) over time have been reported, both decreasing and increasing numbers. Women have been reported to constitute an increasing proportion of patients treated for several manifestations of cardiovascular disease; whether a similar trend is true for AAA is not well understood. This study investigated recent temporal trends in a complete national register regarding the number and type of procedure performed for AAA, and outcome, with special emphasis on gender differences.\nData for all individuals treated for nonruptured or ruptured AAA in Sweden (1990 to 2005) were obtained from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (NBHW). A total of 14369 individuals were identified; 2327 (16%) were women. Date and type of intervention, date and cause of death, age, and sex were included in the statistical model.\nThere was a relative annual increase in interventions for nonruptured AAA; 4% for women (P < .0001) and 2% for men (P < .0001). No significant trends were observed for interventions for rupture during the observation period. No significant increase in the proportion of women was recorded for nonrupture (17%) or rupture (15%). Women had higher crude 30-day mortality rate than men after treatment for both nonruptured (5.7% vs 4.9%) and ruptured (41.9% vs 36.8%) AAA. In a logistic regression model, survival improved over time after intervention for nonrupture (P < .0001) and rupture (P < .0001). Increasing age (P < .0001 for both nonrupture and rupture) but not sex (P = .49 for non rupture and P = .42 for rupture) had a negative influence on mortality.\nInterventions for nonruptured but not for ruptured AAA increased over time, with an expected rapid increase of endovascular repair in the nonruptured group. The unchanged fraction of women over time possibly reflects the true distribution of AAA between the sexes. The outcome after treatment for both nonruptured and ruptured AAA improved, as anticipated, over time. No increase in mortality among women was recorded after adjustment for age.",

    "abstract": "Great saphenous vein (GSV) reflux is the most frequent form of venous insufficiency in symptomatic patients and is commonly responsible for varicose veins of the lower extremity. This non-randomized prospective controlled study was designed to test the hypothesis that 1) endovenous laser treatment is more effective than foam sclerotherapy in the closure of the refluxing GSV (as measured by degree of great saphenous vein reflux and venous clinical severity score changes) and 2) to record the associated complications of echo-guided endovenous chemical ablation with foam and endovenous laser therapy for the treatment of great saphenous vein reflux and to further identify risk factors associated with treatment failure.\nBetween January 1, 2006 and June 25, 2006, patients seeking treatment of varicose veins at a private practice of vascular medicine were assessed for the study. Inclusion criteria were: 1) presence of great saphenous vein reflux and 2) C2-6, Epr, A s, according to the CEAP classification. The selected patients consented into the study and were allowed to choose between foam (53 patients) or laser (45 patients) treatment. Duplex examinations were performed prior to treatment and at seven and 14 days, four weeks, six months, and one year after treatment. Venous clinical severity score was assessed pre-treatment and at one year post-procedure.\nThe cohorts showed no statistically significant differences in age, sex, clinical and anatomical presentation, great saphenous vein diameter, and venous clinical severity score before the treatments. After one year follow up, occlusion of the great saphenous vein was confirmed in 93.4% (42/45) of limbs studied in the laser group and 77.4% (41/53) of limbs in the foam group (P < .0465). Venous clinical severity score significantly improved in both groups (P < .0001). Procedure associated pain was higher in the laser group (P < .0082). Induration, phlebitis, and ecchymosis were the most common complications. Logistical regression and subgroups analysis shown that a larger great saphenous vein diameter measured before treatment was associated with treatment failure in the foam (odds ratio 1.68, 95% CI 1.24-2.27, P < .0008) and in the laser group (odds ratio 1.91, 95% CI 1.02-3.59, P < .0428). A 90% treatment success is predicted for veins <6.5 mm in the foam group versus veins <12 mm in the laser group.\nOverall, endovenous laser ablation achieved higher occlusion rates than echo-guided chemical ablation with foam after one year follow-up. Matching the patient to the technique based on great saphenous vein diameter measured before treatment may assist in boosting the treatment success rate to >90%. A larger patient cohort followed and compared over a longer period of time would be required to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the effect of long-term anticoagulant treatment (enoxaparin vs coumarin) in patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) as to incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and recurrent venous thromboembolism. We also analyzed the impact of thrombus regression after the anticoagulant treatment for these two outcomes.\nA prospective study was designed in which 165 patients with symptomatic, unilateral, first-episode DVT were randomized to a long-term anticoagulant treatment with coumarin or enoxaparin during at least 3 months. The rate of thrombus regression was defined as the difference in Marder score after 3 months of treatment by venography. Follow-up was performed at 3, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter for 5 years. Venous disease was related to pathologic severity of PTS according to the validated scale of Villalta as rated by a physician blinded to treatment. Recurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism was documented objectively.\nThe 5-year follow-up period was completed for 100 patients (enoxaparin, 56; coumarin, 44). A lesser incidence of PTS was observed in the enoxaparin group (39.3% absent, 19.6% severe) than in the coumarin group (29.5% absent, 29.5% severe), although this difference was not statistically significant. The accumulated recurrence rate was 19.3% with enoxaparin compared with 36.6% with coumarin (P = .02). Although the mean Marder score was significantly improved in both groups (49.1% for enoxaparin vs 24.0% for coumarin; P = .016), a lower reduction in thrombus size was associated with higher clinical events of recurrence (hazard ratio = 1.97; 95% CI, 1.06-3.66; P = .032). A significant inverse correlation was also found between the degree of thrombus regression at 3 months and the incidence at 5 years of PTS (P = .007).\nResidual venous thrombosis is an important risk factor for recurrent thromboembolism and PTS. A greater reduction in thrombus size was associated with lesser clinical events of recurrence and consequently a lesser rate of PTS. However, despite a greater recanalization with enoxaparin, the incidence of PTS was similar between both treatment groups, probably because of the small sample size. Further investigations are needed to clarify the implication of the anticoagulant treatment in the severity of PTS.",

The experimental study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of stent grafts (S/Gs) with slow release of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) for the organization.\nThe S/Gs were constructed of self-expanding Z stent covered with expanded polytetra fluoroethylene graft, and coated with elastin to be able to bind and slowly release bFGF. Five elastin-coated S/Gs with bFGF (bFGF-S/Gs) and without bFGF (C-S/Gs) were placed in the normal canine aorta respectively. The thoracic aortic aneurysm models were surgically created with a jugular vein patch in 12 beagles. S/Gs with six holes, for creating endoleaks, were used in the experiment of aneurysmal repair. The bFGF-S/Gs (n = 6) and C-S/Gs (n = 6) were implanted. The beagles were sacrificed at two weeks after the endovascular procedure and examined histologically.\nThe bFGF-S/Gs induced six times the intimal proliferation of the C-S/Gs in normal aorta. Twelve animals had successfully created aneurysms, and had endoleaks just after the endovascular procedure. At two weeks after the endovascular procedure, the percentage of fibrous area in the aneurysmal cavity treated with bFGF-S/G (35.7 +/- 4.3%) was significantly greater than C-S/G (13.6 +/- 2.2%) (P < .01).\nbFGF-S/Gs are effective for accelerating organization of the aneurysm cavity and developing neointima.

    "abstract": "The distal revascularization and interval ligation (DRIL) procedure has evolved as the optimal treatment for access-related hand ischemia despite concerns about its durability. This study was designed to review our institutional experience and objectively define its mid-term outcome.\nA retrospective review of all patients undergoing the DRIL procedure was performed. The diagnosis of severe hand ischemia was made based primarily upon clinical presentation, but confirmed with noninvasive imaging in select cases. The DRIL conduit was selected based upon noninvasive imaging (vein conduit criteria: saphenous > arm; diameter >/=3 mm) and the proximal anastomosis was positioned >/=7 cm from the access anastomosis. The DRIL bypasses were followed in a graft surveillance protocol and remedial procedures performed as dictated by clinical or ultrasound scan findings.\nSixty-four DRIL procedures were performed in 61 patients (age - 58 +/- 13 standard deviation [SD], female - 62%, diabetic - 72%). The index access procedures included: autogenous brachiocephalic - 46%, autogenous brachiobasilic - 31%, autogenous brachioaxillary translocated femoral vein - 20%, other -3%. The precipitating symptoms were pain (25%), paresthesia (34%), motor dysfunction (24%), and tissue loss (17%); a pre-emptive DRIL was performed in 5 patients. The timing of the DRIL relative to the index access was dictated by the symptoms: <24 hrs - 19%; 1 day </= DRIL </=7 days - 29%; 7 days </= DRIL </=30 days - 8%; >30 days - 44%. Perioperative mortality rate was 3% and the complication rate was 22% (wound - 14%). The DRIL procedure relieved the ischemic symptoms in 78% of the cases (residual symptoms: paresthesia - 13%; pain - 5%; tissue loss - 4%; motor - 2%). The DRIL also resulted in significant (P < .05) increases in both the wrist/brachial index (WBI) and digital/brachial index (DBI) with the mean increases of 0.34 +/- 0.26 and 0.41 +/- 0.21, respectively. The primary DRIL patency rates (+/- standard error of the mean [SEM]) were 77 +/- 8%, 74 +/- 9%, and 71 +/- 9% at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years, respectively, while the corresponding secondary patency rates were 81 +/- 7%, 76 +/- 9%, and 76 +/- 9%, and the survival rates were 71 +/- 6%, 59 +/- 7%, and 33 +/- 9%. The index access procedure went on to mature sufficiently for cannulation in 68% of the cases when the DRIL was performed early (ie, <3 months from index access); all accesses functional at the time of the DRIL were used for dialysis throughout the perioperative period.\nThe DRIL procedure safely and effectively relieves the symptoms of severe access-related hand ischemia while preserving the access. The midterm results suggest that the DRIL bypasses are durable, although long-term graft surveillance may be justified given the observed failures.",

    "abstract": "Several reports in the literature have described the value of regional cerebral oximetry (rSO(2)) as a neuromonitoring device during carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The use of rSO(2) is enticing because it is simpler and less expensive than other neuromonitoring modalities. This study was performed to compare the efficacy of rSO(2) with electroencephalography (EEG) and median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) in determining when to place a shunt during CEA.\nFrom October 2000 to June 2006, 323 CEAs were performed under general anesthesia by six surgeons. Shunting was done selectively on the basis of EEG and SSEP monitoring under the auspices of an intraoperative neurophysiologist. All patients were retrospectively reviewed to see if significant discrepancies existed between EEG/SSEP and rSO(2).\nTwenty-four patients (7.4%) showed significant discrepancies. Sixteen patients showed no significant EEG/SSEP changes, but profound changes occurred in rSO(2), and no shunt was placed. In seven patients there was no change in rSO(2) but a profound change occurred in EEG/SSEP, and shunts were placed. In one patient early in the series, the EEG and SSEP were unchanged but the rSO(2) dropped precipitously, and a shunt was placed. In the 299 patients who showed no discrepancies, 285 were not shunted and 14 required a shunt. Two strokes occurred in the entire series (0.6%), none intraoperatively. Shunts were placed in 23 patients (7%). The sensitivity of rSO(2) compared with EEG/SSEP was 68%, and the specificity was 94%. This gave a positive-predictive value of 47% and a negative-predictive value of 98%.\nRelying on rSO(2) alone for selective shunting is potentially dangerous and might have led to intraoperative ischemic strokes in seven patients and the unnecessary use of shunts in at least 16 patients in this series. The use of rSO(2) adds nothing to the information already provided by EEG and SSEP in determining when to place a shunt during CEA.",

    "abstract": "We compared the results of endovascular repair using the Powerlink endovascular graft with conventional open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair through a 6-year follow-up period.\nTwo hundred fifty-eight patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms were prospectively enrolled in a multicenter trial and underwent endovascular repair (N = 192) or conventional open surgery (N = 66). All endovascular repairs were approached through a surgically exposed femoral artery and a percutaneously accessed femoral artery. Study endpoints included all-cause mortality and morbidity. Follow-up imaging consisted of contrast-enhanced CT scans and plain abdominal x-rays at 1, 6, 12 months, and annually postoperatively.\nTechnical success was achieved in 97.9% of test patients, with four failed insertions (three early conversions because of deployment issues, one access failure). Mean follow-up was 4.1 +/- 1.7 years (test group) and 3.1 +/- 1.9 years (control group). Perioperative morbidity and mortality were significantly reduced in the test group compared with the control group (P < .05). At 6 years, all-cause mortality and morbidity was no different in the Powerlink group compared with the open repair group. There were no reported stent fractures, graft disruptions, or aneurysm ruptures. Core laboratory-reported endoleaks included proximal or distal type I (n = 1) and type I/II (n = 3), with no type III or type IV endoleaks. One explant (0.5%) was undertaken to resolve a refractory type I endoleak. A total of 37 secondary procedures were performed in 26 patients to treat site-reported endoleak (n = 26; 7 for type I and 19 for type II), graft limb occlusion (n = 7), native artery occlusion (n = 3), or endograft migration (n = 1). A reduction in mean aneurysm sac diameters and volumes has been noted at every follow-up interval.\nConsistent with other reports, perioperative morbidity and mortality were significantly reduced in the endovascular group compared with the open repair group. Six-year follow-up of patients treated with the Powerlink system demonstrates the continued safety and efficacy of its treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm.",

    "abstract": "Avoidance of nephrotoxic contrast agents during endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR) may reduce the incidence of renal dysfunction following the procedure. Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) angiography is a safe alternative to iodinated contrast media vastly under-utilized by vascular surgeons. We herein describe our experience with a simple angiographic technique using CO(2) for EVAR guidance that does not require a separate angiographic catheter.\nEighteen patients underwent EVAR using angiography with CO(2) delivered through the endograft sheath. The renal and hypogastric arteries were localized for endograft deployment exclusively with CO(2) in all patients. Completion angiography was done with CO(2) in all patients and an additional angiogram with iodinated media was done in 13 cases.\nAll endograft deployments were done successfully with CO(2) angiography injected through the endograft delivery systems and femoral access sheaths. Additional iodinated media completion angiography did not modify the procedure in any case. All patients were discharged within two days after surgery. There were no ischemic or systemic complications related to CO(2) administration. Follow-up CT-scan revealed well positioned endografts with the expected patent renal and hypogastric arteries in all patients, and no additional endoleaks. No significant deterioration in renal function occurred in any case.\nCarbon dioxide angiography conducted through the endograft delivery sheath is reliable for endograft deployment, safe, non-toxic and inexpensive. In addition, it may expedite EVAR by eliminating a number of angiographic catheter placements and exchanges during the procedure. This favorable experience warrants further utilization of this technique.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic thoracic aortic injuries are associated with high mortality and morbidity. These patients often have multiple injuries, and delayed aortic repair is frequently used. Endoluminal grafts offer an alternative to open surgical repair. We performed a meta-analysis of comparative studies evaluating endovascular vs open repair of these injuries.\nA systematic search of studies reporting treatment of traumatic aortic injury was performed using the following databases: Medline/PubMed, CINAHL, Proquest, Up to Date, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Search terms were thoracic aortic trauma, traumatic thoracic aortic injury, traumatic aortic rupture, stent graft repair, and endovascular repair. Outcomes analyzed were procedure-related mortality, overall 30-day mortality, and paraplegia/paraparesis rate using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Publication bias was investigated using funnel plots. Assessment of homogeneity was performed using the Q test; statistical heterogeneity was considered present at P < .05. Weighted averages of age, interval to repair, and injury severity score were compared with the Welch t test; P < .05 was considered statistically significant.\nSeventeen retrospective cohort studies from 2003 to 2007 were included. All were nonrandomized; no prospective randomized trials were found. These studies reported on 589 patients; 369 were treated with open repair, and 220 underwent thoracic stent graft placement. There was no significant difference in age (mean 38.8 years for both) or interval to repair (mean 1.5 days for endoluminal repair; 1 day for open repair). Injury severity score was higher for patients undergoing endoluminal repair (mean, 42.4 vs 37.4 for open repair, P < .001). Procedure-related mortality was significantly lower with endoluminal repair (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.15-0.66; P = .002). Overall 30-day mortality was also lower after endoluminal repair (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.78; P = .005). Sixteen studies reported data for postoperative paraplegia; 215 patients were treated with endograft placement and 333 with open repair. The risk of postoperative paraplegia was significantly less with endoluminal repair (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.1-0.93; P = .037). The Q test did not indicate significant heterogeneity for the outcomes of interest; publication bias was limited.\nMeta-analysis of retrospective cohort studies indicates that endovascular treatment of descending thoracic aortic trauma is an alternative to open repair and is associated with lower postoperative mortality and ischemic spinal cord complication rates.",

Forty-four subjects were analyzed based on intention-to-treat.\nPlasma MMP-9 decreased significantly below baseline in the doxycycline (N = 20) treated patients at 6 months (-16.4% +/- 20.7%, P < .05) while there was a nonsignificant increase in the placebo (N = 24) group (128.1% +/- 73.5%). This was primarily related to changes between 1 and 6 months. In patients with endoleaks at 6 months, plasma MMP-9 increased in 83% of the placebo treated patients, but in only 14% of the doxycycline treated group (P < .03). Among endoleak-free patients with AneuRx or Excluder endografts, doxycycline treatment resulted in greater decreases in maximum aortic diameter than placebo treatment (-13.3% +/- 3.3% vs -3.8% +/- 3.0%, P < .05). Furthermore, doxycycline treatment significantly reduced the aortic neck dilatation at 6 months in Excluder treated patients.\nThere is evidence of persistent MMP release representing ongoing aortic degradation after endografting which can be inhibited by doxycycline therapy. In analyses based on the endograft used, treatment with doxycycline also demonstrated evidence of increased aortic dimensional stability, a surrogate marker for long-term success of EVAR. Although encouraging, these results require confirmation in larger patient populations. Doxycycline should undergo more thorough evaluation as a potential adjuvant treatment to improve the results of EVAR, particularly in certain subgroups.",

    "abstract": "Graft collapse is a known complication of thoracic aortic stent grafting, particularly in cases of traumatic thoracic aortic transection, when a typically smaller diameter aorta is repaired with a relatively large diameter device. In contrast, obstruction of the aorta from a stent graft that protrudes into the aortic arch but does not collapse is a less common complication of thoracic aortic stent grafting that can present as a functional aortic coarctation. We describe here two cases of physiologic coarctation of the aorta caused by stent graft protrusion into the arch that were successfully treated with stent graft explantation and open aortic reconstruction.",

However, filter placement is associated with a high rate of serious complications (>30%), with death occurring in 3.7% of patients. The most common complication is an asymptomatic inferior vena cava penetration and perforation. In some rare circumstances, however, therapeutic intervention may be required because of perforation of adjacent organs. We report a clinical case of a patient with simultaneous caval, duodenal, and aortic perforation resulting from penetration of inferior vena cava filter hooks. A brief review of the literature discusses presenting symptoms and treatment of such rare complications.",

Sonography and ascending phlebogram showed a complete occlusion of the right femoropopliteal veins, both iliacs and the inferior vena cava (IVC). A large collateral circulation throughout the paravertebral plexus and azygos system was also observed. The CT scan revealed a 5 x 9 cm thrombosed aneurysm of the right external iliac vein and a congenital hypoplasia of the infrarenal IVC. Anticoagulant treatment and compression with elastic stocking was started. The 3-month follow-up showed mild residual edema of the right lower limb. The literature on this pathology is extensively reviewed.",

We report the first two cases of hemodialysis graft seromas successfully treated with a covered stent. Both patients underwent arteriovenous graft placement from the brachial artery to the axillary vein using a standard wall, tapered 4 to 7 mm polytetrafluoroethylene graft, but developed a seroma at the arterial end of the graft. Unsuccessful attempts were made to treat these seromas with percutaneous and open drainage.

The disease may lead to ischemia, necrosis, and amputation of distal extremities; most patients have significant improvement in symptoms if smoking is discontinued. We report a patient who experienced progression of biopsy-proven Buerger's disease, after substituting smokeless tobacco for cigarettes. The patient's disease was severe enough to eventually require bilateral below-knee amputations. The association of smokeless tobacco with progressive limb ischemia should lead clinicians to discourage the substitution of smokeless tobacco for cigarette smoking in patients with Buerger's disease.",

    "abstract": "Experience with open surgical bypass suggests similar overall outcomes in women compared with men, but significantly increased risk of wound complications. Percutaneous treatment of lower extremity occlusive disease is therefore an attractive alternative in women, although it is not clear whether there is a difference in outcomes between women and men treated with this technique. We sought to determine the results and predictors of failure in women treated by percutaneous intervention.\nPercutaneous infrainguinal revascularization was performed on 309 women between 2001 and 2006. Procedures, complications, demographics, comorbidities, and follow-up data were entered into a prospective database for review. Patency was assessed primarily by duplex ultrasonography. Outcomes were expressed by Kaplan-Meier curves and compared by log-rank analysis.\nA total of 447 percutaneous interventions performed in 309 women were analyzed and compared with 553 interventions in men. Mean age in women was 73.2 years; comorbidities included hypertension (HTN) (86%), diabetes melitus (DM) (58%), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) (15%), hemodialysis (7%), hypercholesterolemia (52%), coronary artery disease (CAD) (42%), and tobacco use (47%). Indications in women included claudication (38.0%), rest pain (18.8%), and tissue loss (43.2%). Overall primary & secondary patency and limb-salvage rates for women were 38% +/- 4%, 66% +/- 3%, and 80% +/- 4% at 24 months. In this patient sample, women were significantly more likely than men to present with limb-threatening ischemia (61.6% vs 47.3%, P < 0.001) and have lesions of TASC C and D severity (71.4% vs 61.7%, P < .005). However, there were no significant differences in primary and secondary patency rates or limb-salvage rates between genders. Furthermore, while women with limb-threat, diabetes, and advanced TASC severity lesions were at increased risk of failure overall, there were no differences between women and men with these characteristics.\nPercutaneous infrainguinal revascularization is a very effective modality in women with lower extremity occlusive disease. Although women in this sample were more likely to present with limb-threat than men, patency and limb-salvage rates were equivalent between genders, even in high-risk subsets such as diabetics or those with lesions of increased TASC severity.",

    "abstract": "To assess primary success and safety of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and/or stenting of ostial/proximal common carotid artery lesions (pCCA) and to compare its 30-day stroke/mortality level with the literature data for surgical options.\nA total of 147 patients (153 stenoses, 6 recurrent) (71 female; 121 left) with significant diameter stenosis (>70% in symptomatic, n = 46; >85% in asymptomatic, n = 101 patients) of pCCA treated between 1994 and 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. With the exception of one, all procedures were performed using a transfemoral approach. A stent was implanted in 108 (70.5%) of cases. Stents were not available in the early years of our experience, but gradually became a routine practice. Embolic protection devices were used in 16 cases. Follow-up included neurological examination, carotid duplex scan, and office/telephone interview.\nPrimary technical success was 98.7% (151/153 stenoses). There were no deaths. Periprocedural (<48 hours) neurological complications included 3/153 (2.0%) ipsilateral major strokes and 4/153 (2.6%) TIAs (including one contralateral TIA). There were 8/153 (5.2%) access site hematomas, 1/153 (0.7%) bradycardia, and 1/153 (0.7%) acute left ventricular failure with respiratory distress. Follow-up was achieved in 115/147 patients (78.2%) undergoing 120 procedures for a mean of 24.7 months and revealed one additional contralateral TIA and one additional minor stroke in an asymptomatic patient. In patients with follow-up, the 30-day procedural death/all-stroke rate was 3/120 (2.5%) The cumulative primary patency rate in the 115 patients with follow-up was 97.9% +/- 2.1% at 1 year, 82.0% +/- 7.1% at 4-years, and 73.5% +/- 12.7% at 7 years. The cumulative secondary patency rate was 100% at 1 year, 88.0% +/- 7.0% at 4 years, and 88.0% +/- 11% at 7 years. Log-rank test showed no statistical difference (P = .82) in primary cumulative patency between PTA alone (n = 34) or PTA/stent (n = 86).\nTransfemoral PTA/stenting appears to be appropriate treatment option for ostial/proximal common carotid artery significant stenoses. This study should also draw attention to the lack of data on natural history or effect of best medical treatment alone for these lesions, making evidence-based decision currently impossible for treatment of symptomatic or asymptomatic ostial and proximal common carotid artery significant stenoses.",

Open supra-aortic transposition or debranching of the great vessels was performed in 14 cases of dissection (50%) and six cases (100%) of aneurysm. In 14 dissections, the entry tear was located in the distal aortic arch, enabling the left subclavian artery to be sealed without reconstruction. The procedures were successful in 33 patients (97.1%); one intraoperative death occurred. Type I endoleaks were found intraoperatively in eight cases. After management with balloon angioplasty and by extending the stent implantation, the endoleaks resolved in four cases and decreased in four cases. One patient with Stanford type A dissection died from an unknown cause 3 months after treatment. The overall survival rate was 94.1% (32/34), and all bypass grafts remained patent during the follow-up period.\nEndovascular stent grafting is a safe and effective method for the treatment of aortic arch lesions. Transposition of the supra-aortic great vessels can be effectively combined with endovascular stent grafting to ensure both cerebral blood supply and enough landing area for the stent graft.",

    "abstract": "Lower extremity embolization occurs during aortoiliac aneurysm repair and may require major amputation when distal arteries are occluded. Because nonoperative treatments are often ineffective, we evaluated an aggressive operative approach.\nIn the past 11 years, we performed 328 endovascular and 350 open aortoiliac aneurysm repairs. Excluding cases of embolization to iliac, femoral, popliteal, and more proximal tibial vessels, which were treated in a standard fashion, foot ischemia severe enough to produce cadaveric, pregangrenous, or gangrenous skin changes occurred from more distal embolization after seven endovascular and three open aortoiliac aneurysm repairs. Six of these 10 patients underwent thromboembolectomies of both their dorsalis pedis and perimalleolar posterior tibial arteries < or =4 hours of their original operation. In the other four patients, treatment was delayed 7 to 10 days. Because of progressive foot ischemia, arteriography was performed. From these results, four bypasses (3 autologous vein, 1 polytetrafluoroethylene graft) were performed to the transverse metatarsal arch, dorsalis pedis, perimalleolar peroneal artery, or perimalleolar anterior tibial artery.\nPatency and limb-salvage rates for both thromboembolectomy and bypass procedures were 100% at a mean follow-up of 3.0 years (range, 5 months-8 years).\nPerimalleolar and foot artery thromboembolectomy and bypasses to arteries as distal as the metatarsal arch can be effective treatment for distal embolization from aortoiliac aneurysm repair. Even when cadaveric, pregangrenous, or gangrenous lesions are present, distal arteriography and operative treatment (thromboembolectomy or bypass) may be indicated to successfully salvage the foot.",

    "abstract": "Since the early 1990s, many studies have shown lower mortality for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair at high-volume centers compared with low-volume centers. The introduction of endovascular AAA repair (EVAR) also has changed the practice of AAA repair. The goal of this study was to determine if regionalization of AAA repair occurred in the United States. Etiologic factors were examined in addition to any reduction in operative mortality rates.\nPatient discharges of nonruptured AAA repair were identified from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 1998 and 2004. Hospitals were stratified by yearly AAA surgical volume of low (< or =17 cases), medium (18 to 50), and high (>50).\nA total of 46,901 patients underwent AAA repair (72.7% open vs 27.3% endovascular). The percentage of AAA repairs performed at both low-volume (36.2% to 24.3%) and medium-volume (51.0% to 44.8%) centers fell; whereas, the percentage performed at high-volume centers nearly tripled (12.9% vs 30.9%). In 1998 there were 10 high-volume centers; by 2004 this had increased to 26. The number of low-volume centers decreased, from 412 to 328. EVAR was more rapidly adopted by high-volume centers compared with low-volume centers. By 2004, 64.3% of AAA repairs at high-volume centers were done with endovascular techniques compared with 31.8% in low-volume centers. A concurrent reduction occurred in patient mortality, from 4.4% in 1998 to 2.5% in 2004 (P < .0001).\nBetween 1998 and 2004, a trend towards the regionalization of AAA repair to high-volume centers occurred. Nearly one-third of all AAA repairs were performed at high-volume centers. There was a concurrent increase in the frequency of endovascular AAA repair, especially at high-volume centers. During this period of regionalization of AAA repair to high-volume centers, patient mortality after AAA repair decreased by 23%. Thus, the observed regionalization of AAA repair and the reduction in short-term patient mortality for this operation may be explained by increased utilization of endovascular technologies at high-volume centers.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate contemporary results of ruptured aortoiliac aneurysms (RAAA) and identify the role of surgeons' annual aortic volume and other prognostic indicators for early outcome.\nA retrospective review identified 213 consecutive patients who presented with an atherosclerotic RAAA without thoracic extension over 6.5 years ending in June 2007. Excluded were 31 ruptures treated by endovascular repair (EVAR) or following previous EVAR, also excluded were two chronic asymptomatic hemodynamically stable ruptures. Ten patients were not treated due to either patient's refusal or prohibitive surgical risk. Demographic, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were collected. Log rank test and Cox proportional hazard model analyses were utilized to identify factors contributing to mortality and morbidity in these patients. Survival rates were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method.\nOne hundred thirty-one males and 39 females with a mean age of 74.5 +/- 8.1 years underwent consecutive RAAA repairs. The operative mortality rate was 38.2% (65/170), including 29 intraoperative deaths. Using multivariate analysis, surgeon's average annual AAA volume (<20/y), advanced age, and postoperative intestinal ischemia were independent predictors of perioperative deaths. Shock on presentation, preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation or free rupture were not. High-volume surgeons (>20 average annual AAA cases/y) had a higher 30-day survival rates (78.4% vs 57.9%, P = .024). Octogenarians had a lower 30-day survival rate of 49.0% vs 70.5% (P = .012). Patients who developed postoperative intestinal ischemia had a lower 30-day survival rate compared with patients without (48.1% vs 15.3%, P = .002). Increased intraoperative fluid and blood product usage was associated with bowel ischemia (P < .05).\nRAAA remains a highly lethal problem. The improved early outcomes of surgeons with high-volume AAA have strong implications for training, emergency staffing needs and alternative treatment strategies.",

The results were similar for the midpoint (beta = 0.19, P < .01; beta = 0.12, P = .01, respectively) and bifurcation (beta = 0.09, P < .04; beta = 0.09, P = .03, respectively).",

    "abstract": "Age greater than 80 has been identified as a risk factor for complications, including stroke and death, in patients undergoing carotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS). This study evaluates other potential predictors of perioperative complications in patients undergoing CAS.\nAll cerebrovascular endovascular procedures performed by the vascular surgery division at our university hospital between July 2003 and December 2005 were retrospectively examined. During the course of 212 admissions, 198 patients underwent 215 procedures. Patient age, comorbidities, and admission status were analyzed as independent (predictor) variables. Complication rate, discharge disposition, and length of hospital stay were considered dependent (outcome) variables. Logistic regression and Fisher exact test or Student t test were performed, as appropriate.\nComplications included major and minor stroke, myocardial infarction, femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, and death. The rates of perioperative major and minor stroke were 0.5% and 2.8%, respectively. Chronic renal insufficiency was a predictor of perioperative complications, including stroke: patients with serum creatinine greater than 1.3 mg/dL had a 37% complication rate and a 11.1% stroke rate, while those with normal renal function had a 13% complication rate (P = .003) and a 0.6% stroke rate (P =.001). Similar association was seen between creatinine clearance and both stroke and complications. Obesity was a risk factor for complications, but not stroke: obese patients had a complication rate of 28%, while others had a 16% complication rate (P = .024). Emergency admission predicted both extended hospital stay (P < .001) and requirement for further inpatient care in a rehabilitation or nursing facility (P = .007). There was no significant difference in complication rate or stroke rate between octogenarians and others.\nThis experience demonstrates that chronic renal insufficiency, obesity, and emergent clinical setting are risk factors for patients undergoing CAS.",

    "abstract": "Recent data suggest that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) may be appropriate primary therapy for critical limb ischemia (CLI). However, little data are available regarding infrapopliteal angioplasty outcomes based on TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus (TASC) classification. We report our experience with infrapopliteal angioplasty stratified by TASC lesion classification.\nFrom February 2004 to March 2007, 176 consecutive limbs (163 patients) underwent infrapopliteal angioplasty for CLI. Stents were placed for lesions refractory to PTA or flow-limiting dissections. Patients were stratified by TASC classification and suitability for bypass grafting. Primary outcome was freedom from restenosis, reintervention, or amputation. Primary patency, freedom from secondary restenosis, limb salvage, reintervention by repeat angioplasty or bypass, and survival were determined.\nMedian age was 73 years (range, 39-94 years). Technical success was 93%. Average follow-up was 10 months (range, 1-41 months). At 1 and 2 years, freedom from restenosis, reintervention, or amputation was 39% and 35%, conventional primary patency was 53% and 51%, and freedom from secondary restenosis and reintervention were 63% and 61%, respectively. Limb salvage was 84% at 1, 2, and 3 years. Within 2 years, 15% underwent bypass and 18% underwent repeat infrapopliteal PTA. Postoperative complications occurred in 9% and intraprocedural complications in 10%. The 30-day mortality was 5% (9 of 181). Overall survival was 81%, 65%, and 54% at 1, 2, and 3 years. TASC D classification predicted diminished technical success (75% D vs 100% A, B, and C; P < .001), primary restenosis, reintervention, or amputation (hazard ratio [HR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-5.5, P < .001), primary patency (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.9, P < .004), secondary restenosis (HR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6-6.4, P = .001), and limb salvage (HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1-6.3, P < .05). Unsuitability for surgical bypass also predicted restenosis, reintervention, or amputation, secondary restenosis, need for repeated angioplasty, and inferior primary patency and limb salvage rates.\nInfrapopliteal angioplasty is a reasonable primary treatment for CLI patients with TASC A, B, or C lesions. Restenosis, reintervention, or amputation was higher in patients who were unsuitable candidates for bypass; however, an attempt at PTA may be indicated as an alternative to primary amputation. Although restenosis, reintervention, or amputation is high after tibial angioplasty for CLI, excellent limb salvage rates may be obtained with careful follow-up and reinterventions when necessary, including bypass in 15%.",

This study examines the durability and long-term results with the Zenith TX1 and TX2 thoracic devices (Cook Inc, Bloomington, Ind) in high-risk patients.\nData were collected prospectively from 2001 to 2007 on high-risk patients who presented with thoracic aneurysms, chronic aortic dissection, or fistulas treated with a Zenith thoracic device. Surgical modifications of proximal or distal landing zones were performed when necessary. Computed tomography follow-up scans were performed before discharge, at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Three-dimensional reconstruction software with central line of flow measurements was used to assess aortic morphologic characteristics. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess survival, freedom from reintervention, predictive factors of poor outcome, and morphologic changes, including aneurysm sac behavior.\nA total of 160 patients (44% women; mean age, 70) were treated for 130 thoracic aneurysms, 25 aortic dissections with aneurysm, 2 fistulas, and 3 symptomatic or aortic ruptures, or both. Mean follow-up was 36 months, and aneurysm size was 67 mm. Seventy-five patients (47%) had undergone prior aortic aneurysm repair. Surgical modifications were required to create adequate landing zones in 33% patients, including 28 elephant trunk/arch reconstruction, 22 carotid-subclavian bypasses, and seven visceral vessel bypasses. Iliac conduits were required in 31 patients. Early mortality (<30 days) occurred in 11 patients (6.9%). Overall mortality at 1 year was 16%. Aneurysm sac increase (>5 mm) requiring intervention was observed only in one patient in the settings of component separation and type III endoleak that was treated; the sac is now stable. Twenty-seven endoleaks were detected in 25 patients: 15 primary endoleaks (9.4%) <30 days and 12 secondary endoleaks (7.5%) >30 days. Secondary interventions were required in 42 patients (26%).\nEndovascular treatment of thoracic aortic pathologies with the Zenith TX1 and TX2 devices is feasible and durable. The mid- to long-term results are encouraging, with acceptable low reintervention rates and with good survival within high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "Peroneal artery bypass is effective for limb salvage (LS), however, the efficacy of peroneal artery-only runoff (PAOR) following endovascular (EV) interventions is unknown. The goal of our article was to compare the efficacy of EV interventions with PAOR to those with other runoff vessels for LS in patients presenting with tissue loss.\nA retrospective review of 111 consecutive patients who underwent infrainguinal EV revascularizations for nonhealing ulcers/gangrene between June 2001 and December 2006 was performed. Patients with PAOR (n = 33) were compared with those with other vessel runoff (OTHER, n = 78). Fisher exact test and chi2 test were used for comparing variables, Kaplan-Meier analyses for patency, LS, and Cox regression multivariate analysis was used for identifying factors associated with limb loss.\nThe patients in PAOR were older, but other morbidities were similar between groups. The most distal level of intervention was infrapopliteal (tibioperoneal or peroneal artery) in 42% in PAOR group whereas this was 24% in OTHER group (P = .071). Preoperative ankle-brachial index (ABI) was similar (0.49 +/- 0.23 vs 0.50 +/- 0.23), however, postprocedure ABI was significantly less for patients with PAOR (0.76 +/- 0.21 vs 0.92 +/- 0.13, P = .001). The primary patency, assisted primary patency, secondary patency and LS were not significantly different between groups. There was also no difference in time-to healing between groups (PAOR vs OTHER, 2.9 +/- 2.1 mo vs 3.7 +/- 3.6 mo, P = .319). We found the presence of gangrene (odds ratio [OR]: 3.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-10.8, P = .028) and dialysis-dependence (OR: 2.9, 95% CI, 1.0-8.2, P = .046) to be associated with limb loss, when adjusted for diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, location of wound, and PAOR.\nEndovascular revascularization with PAOR results in acceptable patency and limb salvage rates in patients presenting with tissue loss, and is equivalent to other vessel runoff for patency, limb salvage and wound healing rates.",

The purpose of this study is to determine the value of intraoperative blood flow measurement with respect to AVF short-term outcome.\nA prospective cohort study enrolled patients undergoing first time AVF creation surgery for hemodialysis from November 2001 to April 2007. Intraoperative blood flow measurements were collected using transit time flowmeter, and primary and secondary patency rates of AVF were examined. Other variables including age, sex, the presence of diabetes, hypertension, or cerebrovascular disease, current smoking, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, serum calcium-phosphate product, and triglyceride and cholesterol level were analyzed.\nAutogenous radiocephalic AVFs (n = 109) in 109 patients were constructed and followed up for an average of 21 months. Among these, 54% of patients were 60 years or older, 51% were male, and 56% were diabetics. One-year primary and secondary patency rates for the high-flow group (> or =200 mL/min) were 69% and 94%, respectively. One-year primary and secondary patency rates for the low-flow group (<200 mL/min) was 52% and 80%, respectively. Using hazard analysis, intraoperative blood flow was the most important determinant of primary and secondary patency, in addition to the presence of diabetes.\nIntraoperative blood flow measurement is a predictor of the primary and secondary patency of autogenous radiocephalic AVFs. Awareness of the significant correlation between intraoperative AVF blood flow and the short-term outcome would enhance the surgical efficiency and maximize the usefulness of autogenous AVF.",

    "abstract": "Impaired dynamic cerebral autoregulation (DCA) has been shown in patients with severe (> or =70%) internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, but DCA in moderate (50% to 69%) ICA stenosis, especially its response to carotid revascularization, has rarely been reported. Our study aimed to characterize DCA in severe and moderate ICA stenosis before and after carotid stenting.\nThis study included 21 patients with ICA stenosis > or =50% who received carotid stenting. Data of arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery, measured by transcranial Doppler, were collected for 10 minutes < or =24 hours before and after stenting. The DCA index, represented as aMx, was assessed by calculating the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient of spontaneous arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity fluctuations. The relationship between aMx and stenotic severity and also alternations of aMx before and after stenting were assessed.\nCarotid stenting was effective to improve the DCA in the stenting side but not in the contralateral nonstenting side. In considering individual ICAs, the average aMx (mean +/- SD) increased significantly from ICA stenosis <50% (0.117 +/- 0.091) to 50% to 69% (0.349 +/- 0.144), 70% to 99% (0.456 +/- 0.147), and total occlusion (0.557 +/- 0.210; P < .05, P < .01, and P < .01, compared with 50% to 69%, 70% to 99%, or total occlusion with <50% stenosis). The correlation between the degree of ICA stenosis and the aMx was also significant (r = 0.693, P < .005). The aMx improved significantly in the stented side after carotid stenting in both moderate and severe ICA stenosis, and this finding was not affected by age, sex, risk factors, or clinical symptoms.\nIn addition to patients with severe carotid stenosis, patients with moderate carotid stenosis may also have impaired DCA that can be restored after carotid stenting.",

    "abstract": "Endoluminal grafting is emerging as a less invasive alternative to the treatment of descending thoracic aorta diseases. Endoleaks (continued pressurization of the treated aorta external to the endoluminal graft) are a potential complication. We reviewed our cumulative endovascular experience for descending thoracic aorta pathologies with respect to the management of endoleaks and associated patient outcomes.\nAs part of a single-site investigational device-exemption protocol, 249 patients (146 men, 103 women) with thoracic aortic diseases underwent attempted delivery of a TAG endoprosthesis (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) between February 2000 and August 2005. Indications for study enrollment included 111 atherosclerotic aneurysms (44.6%), 67 aortic dissections (26.9%), 27 penetrating aortic ulcers (10.8%), 14 contained ruptures (5.6%), 11 pseudoaneurysms (4.4%), 9 acute aortic transections (3.6%), 7 aortobronchial fistulas (2.8%), 2 endoleaks (0.8%) after prior thoracic endoluminal grafting, and 1 (0.4%) adult coarctation. Endoleak surveillance was performed using serial computed tomography scans.\nMean patient age was 68 years (range, 23-91 years). Endoleak developed in 38 patients (15.3%): 15 distal type I (39.5%), 13 proximal type I (34.2%), 8 type II (21.1%) and 2 type III (5.3%). No surgical intervention was performed in 26 patients (68.4%), in which the endoleak spontaneously resolved in 14 (53.8%), 8 (30.8%) are being monitored and are asymptomatic, 3 (11.5%) died of unrelated causes, 2 (7.7%) withdrew from the study, and 1 (3.8%) was lost to follow-up. Twelve patients (31.6%) required reintervention using an additional endoluminal graft: 8 (66.7%) with a proximal type I endoleak, 2 (16.7%) with a distal type I endoleak, 1 (8.3%) with both distal type I and type III endoleaks, and 1 (8.3%) with a type III endoleak. Open conversions were necessary secondary to device deployment difficulties in two patients (0.8%), and due to expansion of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm and rupture of an aneurysm secondary to a type II endoleak in one patient (0.5%) each.\nEndoleaks are an infrequent, yet important, complication after thoracic endografting. Many endoleaks will resolve spontaneously, but some patients may require another endovascular intervention. Close surveillance is recommended for these patients; however, open conversion is rarely indicated. Because more diseases of the thoracic aorta are being treated using an endovascular approach, a standardized treatment algorithm is essential to safely and effectively manage associated endoleaks.",

Median age was 70 years (range, 50-81years). Median aneurysm size was 55 mm (range, 50-80 mm). Eight patients were in American Society of Anesthesiologist class II, and five were in class III. We used laparoscopic transperitoneal left retrorenal approaches and suprarenal clamping in all patients.\nWe implanted tube grafts in nine patients and bifurcated grafts in four. No conversions to open repair were required. Median operative time was 260 minutes (range, 180-355 minutes). Total median aortic clamping time was 77 minutes (range, 36-105 minutes). Median suprarenal clamping time was 24 minutes (range, 9-37 minutes). Median blood loss was 855 mL (range, 215-2100 mL). No patients died. One patient had a postoperative coagulopathy with hemorrhagic syndrome. Five patients had moderate systemic complications, including four renal insufficiencies without dialysis and one grade I ischemic colitis. Liquid diet was reintroduced after 1 day (range, 1-7 days). Most patients were ambulatory by day 3 (range, 2-17 days). Median lengths of stay were 48 hours (range, 12-336 hours) in the intensive care unit and 10 days (range, 4-30 days) in the hospital. With a median follow-up of 19 months (range, 1-36 months), patients had complete recovery without graft anomalies.\nTotal laparoscopic JAAA repair is feasible and worthwhile for patients. Prior experience in laparoscopic aortic surgery is essential to perform these challenging procedures. Despite these encouraging results, a greater experience is required to ensure the benefit of this technique compared with open repair.",

    "abstract": "Paraplegia after thoracoabdominal aneurysm (TAA) repair has been associated with poor survival. Little information exists concerning the spectrum of severity that characterizes spinal cord ischemic (SCI) complications. This study stratified SCI by deficit severity to determine its impact on late survival and functional outcomes.\nA review of our prospectively maintained thoracic aortic database was performed from May 1987 through December 2005 to identify patients who experienced SCI of any extent after TAA repair. During this period, 576 patients underwent descending thoracic aortic repair (93 open, 105 endovascular [TEVAR]) or open TAA repair (279 extent I to III; 99 extent IV). To stratify severity of SCI, we created a spinal cord ischemia deficit (SCID) scale, which is defined as: I, flaccid paralysis; II, average neurologic muscle grade indicating <50% function; and III, average neurologic muscle grade indicating >50% function. Long-term outcomes were evaluated in relation to these groups by actuarial methods.\nDuring the study period, 64 (11.1%) patients developed SCI of any severity (7 of 105 [6.6%] TEVAR, 57 of 471 [12%] open). These were stratified by SCID level: I, 24 (37.5%); II, 31 (48.4%); and III, 9 (14.1%). SCI was immediate in 33 (54.1%) and delayed in 28 (45.9%). Most SCI (6 of 7) associated with TEVAR was delayed. The 30-day mortality was significantly higher in the SCI group than the overall patient cohort (15 of 64 [23.4%] vs 41 of 512 [8%], P < .001) and varied by SCID level: I, 11 of 24 (45.8%); II, 4 of 31 (12.9%); and III, 0 of 9 (0%; P = .001). The 5-year actuarial survival for all SCI was lower than for non-SCI patients (25% +/- 6% vs 51% +/- 3%, P < .001) and varied linearly with SCID level but was similar between SCID II/III and the non-SCI patients (41% +/- 10% vs 51% +/- 3%, P = .281). No SCID I patients were alive at 5 years. No patients with SCID I recovered the ability to walk, but eight of 11 (73%) with SCID II and the nine (100%) with SCID III could ambulate with or without assistance at last follow-up.\nSurvival and functional outcomes correlate with SCI severity. Patients with SCID I have a poor long-term outlook. Survival of SCID II/III patients is similar to non-SCI patients; most recover the ability to ambulate.",

The 30-day mortality was significantly higher in the SCI group than the overall patient cohort (15 of 64 [23.4%] vs 41 of 512 [8%], P < .001) and varied by SCID level: I, 11 of 24 (45.8%); II, 4 of 31 (12.9%); and III, 0 of 9 (0%; P = .001). The 5-year actuarial survival for all SCI was lower than for non-SCI patients (25% +/- 6% vs 51% +/- 3%, P < .001) and varied linearly with SCID level but was similar between SCID II/III and the non-SCI patients (41% +/- 10% vs 51% +/- 3%, P = .281). No SCID I patients were alive at 5 years. No patients with SCID I recovered the ability to walk, but eight of 11 (73%) with SCID II and the nine (100%) with SCID III could ambulate with or without assistance at last follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Microthrombi are undoubtedly the most common embolic material in the cerebral circulation, originating from even minor irregularities of the arterial wall, fibrillating atria, cardiac valves, and patent foramen ovale. Thrombus fragments are globular and likely to completely obstruct terminal vessels. In contrast, previous work with \"atheroemboli\" of needle-like cholesterol crystals rarely cause occlusions or infarctions instead creating small foci of inflammation. In this work, we asked if microthrombi would occlude terminal vessels and create lacunar type infarctions in the subcortical tissues of the rat brain where, as in human brain, collateral flow is limited relative to the cortex.\nThree treatment groups of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. All groups underwent general anesthesia with monitoring of temperature and blood pressure during cannulation of the right internal carotid artery. In the group embolized with thrombus fragments (n = 12), animals had injections of 300 fragments of thrombus size 60 to 100 microns, the cholesterol group (n = 6) had injections of 300 cholesterol crystals of similar size, and the control group (n = 4) had injections of saline. Brains were harvested at 4 days with perfusion fixation and were examined by immunohistochemical staining for breaks in the blood brain barrier (BBB) (albumin), microglial activation (CD11b), astrocyte activation (GFAP), and infarction (loss of NeuN staining). Size and location of the areas of injury and infarction were recorded.\nClot fragments caused discreet infarcts in 10/12 animals that were 0.1-1.7 mm in diameter and coincided with activation of microglia and astrocytes. In some areas, necrosis was already underway at this early time point. Consistent with our previous work, the infarcts caused by cholesterol crystals were smaller (P = .014). Foci of BBB disruption and microglial activation were distributed throughout the brain whereas areas of infarction were found almost exclusively in subcortical tissues (P = .029).\nInjecting microthrombi reproducibly caused areas of necrosis resembling lacunar type infarctions. These were primarily located in the striatum and thalamus presumably because these areas lack the branching, collateral network seen in the cortex. In addition, these data give further evidence that the extent of brain injury from emboli depends upon composition and shape as well as size.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been shown to be effective in stroke prevention for patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Although several prospective randomized trials indicate that carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an alternative but not superior treatment modality, there is still a significant lack of long-term data comparing CAS with CEA. This study presents long-term results of a prospective, randomized, single-center trial.\nBetween August 1999 and April 2002, 87 patients with a symptomatic high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis (>70%) were randomized to CAS or CEA. After a median observation time of 66 +/- 14.2 months (CAS) and 64 +/- 12.1 months (CEA), 42 patients in each group were re-evaluated retrospectively by clinical examination and documentation of neurologic events. Duplex ultrasound imaging was performed in 61 patients (32 CAS, 29 CEA), and patients with restenosis >70% were re-evaluated by angiography.\nDuring the observation period, 23 patients (25.2%) died (10 CAS, 13 CEA), and three were lost to follow up. The incidence of strokes was higher after CAS, with four strokes in 42 CAS patients vs none in 42 CEA patients. One transient ischemic attack occurred in each group. A significantly higher rate of restenosis >70% (6 of 32 vs 0 of 29) occurred after CAS compared with CEA. Five of 32 CAS patients (15.6%) presented with high-grade (>70%) restenosis as an indication for secondary intervention or surgical stent removal, and three presented with neurologic symptoms. No CEA patients required reintervention (P < .05 vs CAS). A medium-grade (<70%) restenosis was detected in eight of 32 CAS patients (25%) and in one of 29 CEA patients (3.4%). In five of 32 CAS (15.6%) and three of 29 CEA patients (10.3%), a high-grade stenosis of the contralateral carotid artery was observed and treated during the observation period.\nThe long-term results of this prospective, randomized, single-center study revealed a high incidence of relevant restenosis and neurologic symptoms after CAS. CEA seems to be superior to CAS concerning the development of restenosis and significant prevention of stroke. However, the long-term results of the ongoing multicenter trials have to be awaited for a final conclusion.",

    "abstract": "The safety and efficacy of the Zenith (Cook Inc, Bloomington, Ind) endovascular graft was assessed based on the United States multicenter trial through 5 years of follow-up.\nBetween 2000 and 2003, the pivotal study enrolled patients to open surgery (control) or the Zenith endovascular graft (endovascular). A separate continued access study arm enrolled endovascular patients using the same inclusion/exclusion criteria. Both studies were designed for 2-year follow-up, and the pivotal endovascular patients had the option of extending the study follow-up through 5 years. All endovascular patients were stratified by physiologic risk into high-risk and standard-risk groups to assess overall mortality, rupture, conversion, endoleaks, secondary interventions, and sac enlargement. The entire endovascular cohort was pooled to assess device integrity, limb occlusion, component separation, and migration. The suboptimal endovascular result (SER) was established as an end point to assess late adverse outcomes. Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier estimations and Cox regression to assess factors contributing to sac enlargement and SER.\nThe study enrolled 739 endovascular patients (352 pivotal, 387 continued access); 158 patients in the pivotal study reconsented to be followed up for 5 years. For the patients at standard and high risk at 5 years, the respective survival estimate was 83% and 61%, aneurysm-related death was 2% and 4%, and freedom from rupture was 100% and 99.6%, respectively. Cumulative risk of conversion, limb occlusion, migration >10 mm, or component separation was < or =3% at 5 years. Cumulative risk of late endoleak was 12% to 15%, representing the primary indication for secondary interventions which occurred in 20% of standard-risk patients and 25% of high-risk patients through 5 years. Sac enlargement was very rare and associated with advanced age and larger aneurysms. SER was predicted by advanced age and internal iliac artery occlusion.\nThese middle- and long-term data support long-term durability of the Zenith endovascular graft. Risk of aneurysm-related death or rupture was exceptionally low, and complications of migration, limb occlusion, and device integrity issues were uncommon. Incidence of late endoleaks and association of endoleaks with sac growth underscore the need for long-term follow-up of patients treated with endovascular grafts, although the sequelae of such events are unknown.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that mechanical failure of intraluminal thrombus (ILT) could play a key role in the rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), and in the present study, this hypothesis has been investigated. An in vitro experimental approach has been proposed, which provides layer-specific failure data of ILT tissue under static and pulsatile mechanical loads.\nIn total, 112 bone-shaped test specimens are prepared from luminal, medial, and abluminal layers of eight ILTs harvested during open elective AAA repair. Three different types of mechanical experiments, denoted as control test, ultimate strength test, and fatigue test were performed in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with fetal calf serum, L-ascorbic acid, and antibiotics at 37 degrees C and pH 7.0. In detail, fatigue tests, which are experiments, where the ILT tissue is loaded in pulsatile manner, were carried out at three different load levels with a natural frequency of 1.0 Hz.\nILT's ultimate strength (156.5 kPa, 92.0 kPa, and 47.7 kPa for luminal, medial, and abluminal layers, respectively) and referential stiffness (62.88 kPa, 47.52 kPa, and 41.52 kPa, for luminal, medial, and abluminal layers, respectively) continuously decrease from the inside to the outside. ILT tissue failed within less than 1 hour under pulsatile loading at a load level of 60% ultimate strength, while a load level of about 40% ultimate strength did not cause failure within 13.9 hours.\nILT tissue is vulnerable against fatigue failure and shows significant decreasing strength with respect to the number of load cycles. Hence, after a reasonable time of pulsating loading ILT's strength is far below its ultimate strength, and when compared with stress predictions from finite element (FE) studies, this indicates the likelihood of fatigue failure in vivo. Failure within the ILT could propagate towards the weakened vessel wall behind it and could initialize AAA failure thereafter.",

    "abstract": "Reliability of the most commonly used duplex ultrasound (DUS) velocity thresholds for internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis has been questioned since these thresholds were developed using less precise methods to grade stenosis severity based on angiography. In this study, maximum percent diameter carotid bulb ICA stenosis (European Carotid Surgery Trial [ECST] method) was objectively measured using high resolution B-mode DUS validated with computed tomography angiography (CTA) and used to determine optimum velocity thresholds for > or =50% and > or =80% bulb internal carotid artery stenosis (ICA).\nB-mode DUS and CTA images of 74 bulb ICA stenoses were compared to validate accuracy of the DUS measurements. In 337 mild, moderate, and severe bulb ICA stenoses (n = 232 patients), the minimal residual lumen and the maximum outer bulb/proximal ICA diameter were determined on longitudinal and transverse images. This in contrast to the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) method using normal distal ICA lumen diameter as the denominator. Severe calcified carotid segments and patients with contralateral occlusion were excluded. In each study, the highest peak systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic (EDV) velocities as well as ICA/common carotid artery (CCA) ratio were recorded. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the optimum threshold for each hemodynamic parameter was determined to predict > or =50% (n = 281) and > or =80% (n = 62) bulb ICA stenosis.\nPatients mean age was 74 +/- 8 years; 49% females. Clinical risk factors for atherosclerosis included coronary artery disease (40%), diabetes mellitus (32%), hypertension (70%), smoking (34%), and hypercholesterolemia (49%). Thirty-three percent of carotid lesions (n = 110) presented with ischemic cerebrovascular symptoms and 67% (n = 227) were asymptomatic. There was an excellent agreement between B-mode DUS and CTA (r = 0.9, P = .002). The inter/intraobserver agreement (kappa) for B-mode imaging measurements were 0.8 and 0.9, respectively, and for CTA measurements 0.8 and 0.9, respectively. When both PSV of > or =155 cm/s and ICA/CCA ratio of > or =2 were combined for the detection of > or =50% bulb ICA stenosis, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 97% and an accuracy of 82% were obtained. For a > or =80% bulb ICA stenosis, an EDV of > or =140 cm/s, a PSV of > or =370 cm/s and an ICA/CCA ratio of > or =6 had acceptable probability values.\nCompared with established velocity thresholds commonly applied in practice, a substantially higher PSV (155 vs 125 cm/s) was more accurate for detecting > or =50% bulb/ICA stenosis. In combination, a PSV of > or =155 cm/s and an ICA/CCA ratio of > or =2 have excellent predictive value for this stenosis category. For > or =80% bulb ICA stenosis (NASCET 60% stenosis), an EDV of 140 cm/s, a PSV of > or =370 cm/s, and an ICA/CCA ratio of > or =6 are equally reliable and do not indicate any major change from the established criteria. Current DUS > or =50% bulb ICA stenosis criteria appear to overestimate carotid bifurcation disease and may predispose patients with asymptomatic carotid disease to untoward costly diagnostic imaging and intervention.",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent development of endovascular therapy (EVT), a high incidence of restenosis remains as an unsolved issue in patients presenting with femoropopliteal lesions. We investigated whether cilostazol reduces restenosis after successful EVT for de novo femoropopliteal lesions.\nThis study was designed as a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point study in a single institution. Between March 2004 and June 2005, we randomized 127 patients who were successfully treated with EVT for de novo femoropopliteal lesions to receive cilostazol (200 mg/d, n = 63) or ticlopidine (200 mg/d, n = 64) in addition to aspirin (100 mg/d). Antiplatelet medications were started at least 1 week before EVT and were continued until the end of follow-up. Patency was defined by duplex ultrasound imaging with peak systolic velocity ratio >2.4.\nThere were no significant differences in the patients and lesion characteristics. Sixteen patients dropped out of the study protocol, six of whom were withdrawn due to adverse drug effects (cilostazol, n = 5; ticlopidine, n = 1; P = .09). Ten patients died (cilostazol, n = 4; ticlopidine, n = 6; P = .53) during the follow-up period. Patency rates at 12, 24, and 36 months were 87%, 82%, and 73% in the cilostazol group and 65%, 60%, and 51% in ticlopidine group by intention-to-treat analysis (P = .013) and were 87%, 82%, and 73% in the cilostazol group and 64%, 57%, and 48% in the ticlopidine group (P = .0088) by as-treated analysis. Freedom from target lesion revascularization and all adverse events (restenosis, amputation, and death) was significantly higher in cilostazol group than in ticlopidine group (P = .036, P = .031). No acute, subacute, or chronic thrombotic occlusion was encountered, and bleeding complication rates were similar between the two groups.\nCilostazol significantly reduces restenosis after EVT in femoropopliteal lesions.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the effect on neointimal hyperplasia of adenovirus-mediated delivery of cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) to the artery after balloon injury.\nSixty rabbits were randomized into three groups and underwent balloon injury in the left common carotid arteries. The injured arterial segment was isolated by two inflated balloon catheters. Saline or recombinant adenovirus expressing CREG or green fluorescent protein was injected into the lumen of the isolated arterial segments and incubated for 30 minutes. The rabbits were euthanized for immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and morphometric analysis at 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after balloon injury and in vivo gene transfer (5 rabbits for each time point). Common carotid artery angiography was performed before euthanasia.\nImmunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis demonstrated that CREG expression was significantly down-regulated in the acute phase of vascular injury and was gradually restored in the resolution phase. The changes of CREG expression were in parallel with those of the smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation markers SM alpha-actin and SM myosin heavy chain in the injured arteries. Adenovirus-mediated CREG transfer markedly increased CREG expression in the injured artery. Consequently, morphometric analysis revealed an approximate 50% reduction in the neointima and the intima/media ratio in CREG-transferred arteries compared with the saline and green fluorescent protein controls. Assay with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine showed that CREG transfer significantly inhibited SMC proliferation. In contrast, endothelialization of the injured artery was not affected by CREG transduction as assessed by CD31 immunostaining.\nThese data suggest that forced expression of CREG in the artery wall after acute vascular injury inhibits SMC proliferation, induces cellular differentiation, and attenuates neointimal hyperplasia. CREG delivery may have therapeutic potential for the prevention of restenosis after vascular angioplasty.",

    "abstract": "Major tissue loss caused by the critical limb ischemia requires improvement of distal perfusion and cover of large tissue defects. We propose a new method, the y-shaped subscapular artery flow-through (Y-SCAFT) muscle flap using the subscapular artery that yields an arterial graft and a free muscle flap sustained by a collateral branch of this artery. This prospective study evaluated the feasibility of this technique and analyzed wound healing, graft patency, and limb salvage.\nBetween 2002 and 2007, 20 patients, mean age 64 years (range, 55-79 years), were treated with this technique. All presented with critical ischemia and major tissue loss, with exposure of the tendons, bones, or joint, and were candidates for major amputation. Revascularization and cover of tissue loss with the same Y-SCAFT anatomic unit was used for all patients. The distal anastomosis was performed between the distal branch of the Y-SCAFT and the pedal artery in 9, posterior tibial artery in 4, peroneal artery in 1, lateral tarsal artery in 3, and the plantar artery in 3. In four patients, the distal part of the arterial graft, including the anastomosis, was covered with the muscle flap because the tissue loss was nearby. The proximal anastomosis was performed between a leg artery and the arterial graft in 10 patients. A venous graft was necessary in 10 patients to extend the bypass proximally.\nOne patient died during the postoperative period. Duplex control evidenced patency all the Y-SCAFT muscle flaps. Healing was achieved in all patients. Mean follow-up was 31 months (range, 6-58 months). No patients died during follow-up. One patient presented occlusion of the Y-SCAFT muscle flap and underwent amputated. One patient had major amputation despite a patent graft. At 2 years, leg salvage was 85%, patency was 94%, and survival was 94%. At the end of the follow-up, 17 patients (1 death, 2 amputations) had a patent graft, a viable muscle flap, wound healing, and a functional leg.\nWe showed the clinical feasibility of the technique of Y-SCAFT muscle flap, which allows for revascularization and cover of major tissue loss with one anatomic unit. This method is particularly useful in selected cases with poor run-off and large ischemic lesions.",

Fat tissue close to arteries may also directly affect atherogenesis. The study examined whether intra-abdominal fat accumulation is an independent determinant of infrarenal aortic diameter in patients with clinically evident arterial disease. The relationship between metabolic syndrome and infrarenal aortic diameter was also assessed in this patient group.\nCross-sectional study was done of 2726 patients with clinically evident arterial disease enrolled in the Second Manifestations of ARTerial Disease (SMART) study. Intra-abdominal fat was measured with ultrasonography and by measuring waist circumference. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel III. The maximal anteroposterior diameter of the infrarenal aorta was measured using ultrasonography. The relation between intra-abdominal fat, metabolic syndrome, and infrarenal aortic diameter was determined with linear regression analyses and adjusted for age, sex, height, and smoking.\nInfrarenal aortic diameters (mm) increased across quartiles of intra-abdominal fat derived by ultrasonography (quartile 4, 19 +/- 7 mm vs quartile 1, 17 +/- 5 mm; adjusted beta, 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-1.94) and across quartiles of waist circumference (quartile 4, 19 +/- 7 mm vs quartile 1, 17 +/- 5 mm; adjusted beta, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.82-2.04). Patients with metabolic syndrome had slightly larger infrarenal aortic diameters (18 +/- 7 mm vs 17 +/- 6 mm; adjusted beta, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.27-1.13) compared with those without metabolic syndrome.\nIntra-abdominal fat accumulation and metabolic syndrome are associated with larger infrarenal aortic diameters in patients with clinically evident arterial disease. These data may indicate a role for intra-abdominal fat in the development of larger aortic diameters.",

    "abstract": "We performed a device-specific comparison of long-term outcomes following endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) to determine the effect(s) of device type on early and late clinical outcomes. In addition, the impact of performing EVAR both within and outside of specific instructions for use (IFU) for each device was examined.\nBetween January 8, 1999 and December 31, 2005, 565 patients underwent EVAR utilizing one of three commercially available stent graft devices. Study outcomes included perioperative (< or =30 days) mortality, intraoperative technical complications and need for adjunctive procedures, aneurysm rupture, aneurysm-related mortality, conversion to open repair, reintervention, development and/or resolution of endoleak, device related adverse events (migration, thrombosis, or kinking), and a combined endpoint of any graft-related adverse event (GRAE). Study outcomes were correlated by aneurysm morphology that was within or outside of the recommended device IFU. chi2 and Kaplan Meier methods were used for analysis.\nGrafts implanted included 177 Cook Zenith (CZ, 31%), 111 Gore Excluder (GE, 20%), and 277 Medtronic AneuRx (MA, 49%); 39.3% of grafts were placed outside of at least one IFU parameter. Mean follow-up was 30 +/- 21 months and was shorter for CZ (20 months CZ vs 35 and 31 months for GE and MA, respectively; P < .001). Overall actuarial 5-year freedom from aneurysm-related death, reintervention, and GRAE was similar among devices. CZ had a lower number of graft migration events (0 CZ vs 1 GE and 9 MA); however, there was no difference between devices on actuarial analysis. Combined GRAE was lowest for CZ (29% CZ, 35% GE, and 43% MA; P = .01). Graft placement outside of IFU was associated with similar 5-year freedom from aneurysm-related death, migration, and reintervention (P > .05), but a lower freedom from GRAE (74% outside IFU vs 86% within IFU; P = .021), likely related to a higher incidence of graft thrombosis (2.3% outside IFU vs 0.3% within IFU; P = .026). The differences in outcome for grafts placed within vs outside IFU were not device-specific.\nEVAR performed with three commercially available devices provided similar clinically relevant outcomes at 5 years, although no graft migration occurred with a suprarenal fixation device. As anticipated, application outside of anatomically specific IFU variables had an incremental negative effect on late results, indicating that adherence to such IFU guidelines is appropriate clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have reported that carotid endarterectomy with patch angioplasty is superior to primary closure. Conventional polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex, W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) patching has been shown to have results similar to autogenous saphenous vein patching; however, it requires a longer hemostasis time. This study examined the long-term clinical outcome and incidence of restenosis after carotid endarterectomy using the new ACUSEAL (Gore-Tex) patching vs Hemashield Finesse (Boston Scientific Corp, Natick, Mass) patching.\nThe study randomized 200 patients (1:1) undergoing carotid endarterectomy to 100 with ACUSEAL patching and 100 with Hemashield-Finesse patching. All patients underwent immediate and 1-month postoperative duplex ultrasound studies, which were repeated at 6-month intervals. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the freedom from stroke, stroke-free survival, and the risk of restenosis for both groups.\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics, the mean operative diameter of the internal carotid artery, and the length of the arteriotomy were similar in both groups. The mean hemostasis time was 5.1 for the ACUSEAL patching vs 3.7 minutes for Finesse patching (P = .01); however, the mean operative times were similar for both groups (P = .61). The incidence of ipsilateral stroke was 2% for ACUSEAL patching (both early perioperative strokes) vs 3% for Finesse patching (2 early and 1 late stroke) at a mean follow-up of 21 months. The respective cumulative stroke-free rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 98%, 98%, and 98% for ACUSEAL patching vs 97%, 97%, and 97% for Finesse patching (P = .7). The respective cumulative stroke-free survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 97%, 92%, and 88% for ACUSEAL patching vs 96%, 96%, and 91% for Finesse patching (P = .6). The respective freedom from > or =70% carotid restenosis at 1, 2, and 3 years was 98%, 96%, and 89% for ACUSEAL patching vs 92%, 85%, and 79% for Finesse patching (P = .04).\nCarotid endarterectomy with ACUSEAL patching and Finesse patching had similar stroke-free rates and stroke-free survival rates. The mean hemostasis time for the ACUSEAL patch was 1.4 minutes longer than that for the Finesse patch; however, the Finesse patch had higher restenosis rates than the ACUSEAL patch.",

    "abstract": "The maximal strain, stress, elastic modulus, and stress-strain curve fitting of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) and bidirectional nonaneurysmal abdominal aorta (NAA) were measured and analyzed to obtain the ultimate mechanical properties, the more approximate stress-strain curve-fitting, and the elastic modulus formula of AAA and NAA.\nFourteen human AAA samples were harvested from patients undergoing elective aneurysm repair. Twelve NAA samples comprised of six longitudinal-circumferential pairs of NAA from six cadaveric organ donors were used as controls. Samples were mounted on a tensile-testing machine and force was applied until breakage occurred. The maximal strain, stress, and elastic modulus were calculated and a stress-strain curve was plotted for each sample. Exponential and second-order polynomial curves were used to fit the stress-strain curve, and the means were estimated by comparing the R2 (coefficient of determination that represents the strength of a curve fitting). Coefficients of elastic modulus were calculated and analyzed, and the incremental tendency of each modulus was evaluated by comparing the difference of coefficients.\nThere was no significant difference in maximal stress among AAA, circumferential aortic aneurysms (CAA), and longitudinal aortic aneurysms (LAA). However, AAA maximal strain was significantly less (P < .01) than that of bidirectional NAA. AAA maximal elastic modulus was significantly greater than that of CAA and LAA (P < .01 and .05, respectively). R2 of AAA for second-order polynomial curve was significantly greater (P < .05) than that for the exponential curve. For the elastic modulus formula from the second-order polynomial curve, E = 2ax + b, the average value of a for the AAA was significantly greater (P < .01) than that for the bidirectional NAA, but there was no significant difference (P > .05) among the three groups for the average value of b.\nTensile test measurements can successfully analyze ultimate mechanical properties of AAA and NAA. AAA is stiffer and less distensible than NAA under the same maximal stress. Second-order polynomial curve fitting provides a more approximate description for AAA stress-strain curve than exponential curve fitting does. Formula variables a of the elastic modulus formula from second-order polynomial curve fitting can determine the incremental tendency of the elastic modulus, while b has negligible effect on the incremental tendency of the elastic modulus.",

The outcome measures were 30-day mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, hospital stay, blood loss, and operative time.\nTwenty-three studies were identified. Of these, only one was a randomized controlled trial, which is now halted. The total number of patients in the pooled data was 7040 (730 emergency endovascular aneurysm repair [eEVAR]).

There is a reduction in the high mortality, prolonged intensive care requirement and total hospital stay, which are historically associated with open repair.

    "abstract": "To lower the risk of complications, carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has been proposed as an alternative to open surgery for carotid artery stenosis after neck irradiation. However, there are little postoperative data to support the benefits of this strategy. This study evaluated the outcome of CAS in patients who had undergone neck irradiation.\nThis retrospective study was conducted at 15 vascular surgery or interventional radiology centers in France between January 1998 and July 2006. A total of 135 patients (115 men) with a mean age of 67 +/- 8 years (range, 43-88) underwent CAS for 149 irradiation-induced lesions. The interval between irradiation and discovery of the lesions was 12 +/- 8 years. Mean diameter reduction was 81% (range, 50%-95%), and stenosis was symptomatic in 34%. Contralateral carotid lesions were observed in 48% of patients, including thrombosis in 18 and stenosis >50% in 53.\nTechnical failure occurred during CAS in three cases. The overall technical success rate was 98%. A cerebral protection device was used in 59%. No death, one transient ischemic attack, and two strokes occurred during the first postoperative month. Mean follow-up was 30 months. Six patients were lost to follow-up. Survival rates were 93.9% at 1 year and 75.3% at 3 years. Complications after the first postoperative month included neurologic events in six, carotid thrombosis in nine, and restenosis in 18. The rates of freedom from neurologic and anatomic events were, respectively, 96.2% and 93.2% at 1 year and 93.1% and 85.9% at 3 years.\nThe immediate outcome of CAS for irradiation-induced carotid artery stenosis was satisfactory. Medium-term neurologic outcome was acceptable, but the incidence of anatomic events such as thrombosis and restenosis was high. A randomized study is needed to confirm that the outcome of the endovascular and surgical therapy is comparable in this indication.",

Two hours before surgery and 6 hours post-surgery, saline (Series I) or enoxaparin sodium (0.6 mg/kg, Series II) was administered intra-peritoneally. Thereafter, the rats were injected daily with saline (Series I) or enoxaparin sodium (1.5 mg/kg, Series II) until construct retrieval at 3, 10, or 21 days. The retrieved constructs underwent weight and volume measurements, and morphologic/morphometric analysis of new tissue components.\nEnoxaparin sodium treatment resulted in the development of smaller AVL constructs at 3, 10, and 21 days.

    "abstract": "The early risk of stroke after a patient suffers a transient ischemic attack (TIA)/minor stroke is significantly higher than previously thought. In most health systems, this (unfortunately) means that many vulnerable patients will have suffered their stroke before having had any chance of being considered for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid angioplasty with stenting (CAS). The problem is then compounded by institutional delays in finally undertaking CEA/CAS, which leads to even greater diminishing benefit to the patient. Notwithstanding the fact that the international trials used a 6-month threshold for inclusion, it remains an unpalatable fact that if CEA/CAS is delayed beyond 12 weeks in symptomatic patients with North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) 50% to 99% stenoses, the patient is exposed to all of the risks of intervening, but gains little in the way of long-term stroke prevention. The take-home message is, therefore, very simple; \"intervene early to prevent more strokes\". Occam's razor has never been sharper!",

    "abstract": "Although endovascular repair of thoracic aortic aneurysm has been shown to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates, spinal cord ischemia remains a persistent problem. We evaluated our experience with spinal cord protective measures using a standardized cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage protocol in patients undergoing endovascular thoracic aortic repair.\nFrom 2004 to 2006, 121 patients underwent elective (n = 52, 43%) and emergent (n = 69, 57%) endovascular thoracic aortic stent graft placement for thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) (n = 94, 78%), symptomatic penetrating ulceration (n = 11, 9%), pseudoaneurysms (n = 5, 4%) and traumatic aortic transactions (n = 11, 9%). In 2005, routine use of a CSF drainage protocol was established to minimize the risks of spinal cord ischemia. The CSF was actively drained to maintain pressures <15 mm Hg and the mean arterial blood pressures were maintained at >/=90 mm Hg. Data was prospectively collected in our vascular registry for elective and emergent endovascular thoracic aortic repair and the patients were divided into 2 groups (+CSF drainage protocol, -CSF drainage protocol). A chi(2) statistical analysis was performed and significance was assumed for P < .05.\nOf the 121 patients with thoracic stent graft placement, the mean age was 72 years, 62 (51%) were male, and 56 (46%) underwent preoperative placement of a CSF drain, while 65 (54%) did not. Both groups had similar comorbidities of coronary artery disease (24 [43%] vs 27 [41%]), hypertension (44 [79%] vs 50 [77%]), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (18 [32%] vs 22 [34%]), and chronic renal insufficiency (10 [17%] vs 12 [18%]). None of the patients with CSF drainage developed spinal cord ischemia (SCI), and 5 (8%) of the patients without CSF drainage developed SCI within 24 hours of endovascular repair (P< .05). All patients with clinical symptoms of SCI had CSF drain placement and augmentation of systemic blood pressures to >/=90 mm Hg, and 60% (3 of 5 patients) demonstrated marked clinical improvement.\nPerioperative CSF drainage with augmentation of systemic blood pressures may have a beneficial role in reducing the risk of paraplegia in patients undergoing endovascular thoracic aortic stent graft placement.

    "abstract": "Percutaneous catheterization is a frequently-used technique to gain access to the central venous circulation. Inadvertent arterial puncture is often without consequence, but can lead to devastating complications if it goes unrecognized and a large-bore dilator or catheter is inserted. The present study reviews our experience with these complications and the literature to determine the safest way to manage catheter-related cervicothoracic arterial injury (CRCAI).\nWe retrospectively identified all cases of iatrogenic carotid or subclavian injury following central venous catheterization at three large institutions in Montreal. We reviewed the French and English literature published from 1980 to 2006, in PubMed, and selected studies with the following criteria: arterial misplacement of a large-caliber cannula (>/=7F), adult patients (>18 years old), description of the method for managing arterial trauma, reference population (denominator) to estimate the success rate of the therapeutic option chosen. A consensus panel of vascular surgeons, anesthetists and intensivists reviewed this information and proposed a treatment algorithm.\nThirteen patients were treated for CRCAI in participating institutions. Five of them underwent immediate catheter removal and compression, and all had severe complications resulting in major stroke and death in one patient, with the other four undergoing further intervention for a false aneurysm or massive bleeding. The remaining eight patients were treated by immediate open repair (six) or through an endovascular approach (two) for subclavian artery trauma without complications. Five articles met all our inclusion criteria, for a total of 30 patients with iatrogenic arterial cannulation: 17 were treated by immediate catheter removal and direct external pressure; eight (47%) had major complications requiring further interventions; and two died. The remaining 13 patients submitted to immediate surgical exploration, catheter removal and artery repair under direct vision, without any complications (47% vs 0%, P = .004).\nDuring central venous placement, prevention of arterial puncture and cannulation is essential to minimize serious sequelae. If arterial trauma with a large-caliber catheter occurs, prompt surgical or endovascular treatment seems to be the safest approach. The pull/pressure technique is associated with a significant risk of hematoma, airway obstruction, stroke, and false aneurysm. Endovascular treatment appears to be safe for the management of arterial injuries that are difficult to expose surgically, such as those below or behind the clavicle. After arterial repair, prompt neurological evaluation should be performed, even if it requires postponing elective intervention. Imaging is suggested to exclude arterial complications, especially if arterial trauma site was not examined and repaired.",

    "abstract": "The presence of a high ankle-brachial index (ABI) is related to stiff ankle arteries due to medial calcification. Recently, this condition has attracted new interest after reports of a worse cardiovascular prognosis, similar to a low ABI. We sought to compare risk factors contributing to a low (< or =0.90) and high (> or =1.40) ABI. Additionally, we hypothesized that in instances of high ABI, occlusive PAD may coexist.\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted at vascular laboratories in a university medical center. The subjects were 510 ambulatory patients (37% had diabetes) previously examined at our vascular laboratories and who responded positively to our invitation. We collected data on smoking, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease history. The noninvasive assessment of lower limb arteries consisted of the measurement of ABI, toe-brachial index (TBI), and posterior tibial artery peak flow velocity (Pk-PT). A TBI >0.7 and a Pk-PT >10 cm/s were considered normal.\nHigh- and low-ABI were detected, respectively, in 2.1% and 57.8% of limbs. For a low ABI, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.29/10 y), pack-years (OR, 1.08/10 units), and hypertension (OR, 1.90) were independent significant (P < .001) factors. A strong association was found between diabetes and high ABI (OR, 16.0; P < .001). When ABI ranges were compared with TBI and Pk-PT results, those with ABI < or =0.90 and ABI > or =1.40 presented similar patterns of abnormalities. Pk-PT or TBI, or both, was abnormal in more than 80% of cases in both ABI < or =0.90 and > or =1.40 groups. The ABI vs TBI relationship appeared linear in nondiabetic patients, but had an inverted J-shape in diabetic patients, suggesting high ABI masked leg ischemia.\nDiabetes is the dominant risk factor for a high (> or =1.40) ABI. Occlusive PAD is highly prevalent in subjects with high ABI, and these subjects should be considered as PAD-equivalent.",

The subjects were 510 ambulatory patients (37% had diabetes) previously examined at our vascular laboratories and who responded positively to our invitation. We collected data on smoking, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease history. The noninvasive assessment of lower limb arteries consisted of the measurement of ABI, toe-brachial index (TBI), and posterior tibial artery peak flow velocity (Pk-PT).

    "abstract": "TransAtlantic Society Consensus (TASC)-II recommends bypass for TASC D and low-risk patients with TASC C lesions but does not specify graft types. Percutaneous balloon angioplasty/stenting (PTA/S) and above knee femoropopliteal bypass (AK-FPB) using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) for these lesions were compared to determine if graft type should be part of the TASC-II recommendations for the treatment of TASC C lesions.\nConsecutive patients who underwent AK-FPB with PTFE, or PTA/S for TASC-II C (PTA/S-C) or D (PTA/S-D) SFA lesions between June 2001 and April 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary end points were primary, assisted-primary, and secondary patency rates.\nIn 127 patients (mean age, 68.7 +/- 10.0 years; median, 68; range, 49-97), 139 limbs were treated (46 AK-FPB, 49 PTA/S-C, 44 PTA/S-D). The mean occlusion and stented lengths were 9.9 +/- 3.8 and 24.3 +/- 6.6 cm (median, 10 and 20 cm) in PTA/S-C, and 26.6 +/- 5.5 and 30.0 +/- 5.2 cm (median, 26 and 29 cm) in PTA/S-D. Technical success was 84% in PTA/S-D and 100% in other groups. Mean follow-up was 26.4 +/- 18.0 months (median, 24). The 12- and 24-month primary patency was 83% +/- 6% and 80% +/- 7% for PTA/S-C; 54% +/- 8% and 28% +/- 12% for PTA/S-D; and 81% +/- 6% and 75% +/- 7% for AK-FPB (P < .001 PTA/S-D vs PTA/S-C and AK-FPB); assisted-primary patency was 95% +/- 3% and 95% +/- 3% for PTA/S-C, 62% +/- 8% and 49% +/- 10% for PTA/S-D, and 81% +/- 6% and 75% +/- 7% for AK-FPB (P < .001, PTA/S-C vs PTA/S-D; P = .003, PTA/S-C vs AK-FPB; and P = .03, PTA/S-D vs AK-FPB). Secondary patency was 98% +/- 3% and 98% +/- 3% for PTA/S-C; 72 % +/- 7% and 54% +/- 11% for PTA/S-D, and 81% +/- 6% and 78% +/- 7% for AK-FPB. Secondary patency was significantly better in PTA/S-C than AK-FPB (P = .003) and PTA/S-D groups (P < .001). The difference was marginally better in AK-FPB than in PTA/S-D (P = .064).\nPTA/S for TASC-II C lesions has a superior midterm patency than AK-FPB using PTFE, and AK-FPB with PTFE has better primary and assisted-primary patency than PTA/S-D. The TASC-II recommendations should be modified to recommend treatment of SFA TASC-II C lesions by PTA/S rather than PTFE bypass for all patients. PTA/S of TASC-II D lesions should only be considered in high-risk patients who cannot tolerate a bypass procedure using PTFE.",

    "abstract": "Few reports of aortoiliac aneurysms infected by Campylobacter fetus are available. We report five cases and review previous reports, with a view to describing the clinical pattern, treatment options, and outcome of this infection.\nDuring a 10-year period, 21 patients were diagnosed with C fetus infection in the Department of Clinical Microbiology, five of whom had an infected arterial aneurysm. We retrospectively reviewed their medical charts. Diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical presentation, computed tomography scan, perioperative findings, and identification of C fetus in at least one blood culture or culture from an aneurysm specimen. Late outcome of surviving patients was assessed by telephone interview.\nWe identified four aortic aneurysms and one hypogastric aneurysm. All patients were seen in an emergency setting. Five had fever and abdominal pain, and three had contained rupture. Campylobacter fetus was found in blood cultures of four patients and in the aneurysm specimen of one patient. Three patients were treated by open repair and two by endovascular repair. One patient treated endovascularly died from septic shock due to C fetus at 2 weeks. One patient treated by open surgery underwent reoperation for persistent infection. The remaining patients were cured, but one died at 5 months of an unrelated cause. All surviving patients received long-term antibiotic therapy.\nCampylobacter fetus infection of aortoiliac aneurysms is a serious condition with a high rate of rupture. However, long-term success can be obtained with prompt surgical treatment and an appropriate antibiotic regimen. The benefits of stent grafts remain debatable.",

    "abstract": "Endosaphenous laser ablation is used in the treatment of great saphenous vein insufficiency with various methods, with and without surgical interruption. However, its mode of action and indications are not yet clear.\nTo verify the mode of action of endosaphenous laser ablation by duplex ultrasound (DUS) follow-up, with the support of histologic observations of eight cases, 44 of 182 affected limbs (CEAP C2 to C6) were selected for intravenous laser ablation of the great saphenous vein. Saphenofemoral junction incompetence was treated by surgical interruption. An 808-nm diode laser (Eufoton, Trieste, Italy) was used (variable pull-back velocity, 1 to 3 mm/s; power, 12 to 15 W; energy, 30 to 40 J/cm). In eight limbs the venous fragments were studied under light microscopy at 5 minutes and after 1 and 2 months. In 44 limbs DUS and clinical examinations were performed from 7 days to 1, 2, 6, and 12 months.\nVariously organized thrombi containing necrotic inclusions and patent areas were observed in the vein lumen. Neither neovascularization nor thrombus extension were detected at the groin by DUS examination. Progressive venous diameter decrease and thrombus fibrotic transformation up to the hypotrophic venous disappearance at 12 months were followed up (P < .00001). Not occluded (18.8%), recanalized short segments (22.7%), two entirely recanalized saphenous veins with varicose recurrence (4.5%), and postoperative phlebitis (13.6%) were observed. Nonocclusions and phlebitis prevailed in the larger veins (P < .05).\nThe healing process is based on vein thrombosis, fibrosis, and venous atrophy. Saphenofemoral interruption makes venous occlusion easier and prevents potential thrombotic complications and recurrence by recanalization. DUS monitoring makes possible to follow-up the thrombus involution and perform early retreatment. The 808-nm endosaphenous laser should be mainly applied to veins of <10 mm in diameter.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate our experience using the SilverHawk atherectomy (Fox Hollow Technologies, Redwood City, Calif) device for lower extremity procedures to determine predictors of midterm success.\nRecords of all patients who underwent lower extremity atherectomy with the SilverHawk atherectomy catheter were reviewed. Patient demographics, vessel treated, number of vessels treated, lesion characteristics, and postoperative courses were analyzed. Cumulative patency rates, limb salvage, mortality, and factors associated with outcomes were determined using the Kaplan-Meier Method with Cox Proportional Hazards modeling.\nBetween January 2004 and January 2006, 167 vessels were atherectomized with the SilverHawk in 73 patients. There were 42 men and 31 women treated, and the mean age was 68.8 +/- 13.8. Five patients had both legs treated for a total of 78 legs treated. Of the 78 legs intervened on, 25.6% (20/78) had 1 vessel treated, 51.3% (40/78) had 2 vessels treated, 11.5% (9/78) had 3 vessels treated, 9% (7/78) had 4 vessels treated, and 2.6% (2/78) had 5 vessels treated. A total of 78% (61/78) of patients had intermittent claudication, 71% (56/78) had rest pain, and 58% (45/78) had tissue loss. Adjunctive procedures were performed in 63 vessels in 33 patients (61 percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA] and 2 PTA + stent). Eighty-four vessels treated were totally occluded and 83 stenotic. Cumulative 1-year primary, primary assisted, secondary patency, limb salvage, and survival rates with confidence intervals, respectively, are: 43% (30,57), 49% (36,63), 57% (43,71), 75% (57,92), and 90% (80,100). Multivariable analysis demonstrated tobacco use, renal disease, diabetes, and tissue loss are all predictors of patency loss, while only diabetes and tissue loss were associated with greater limb loss. There was no difference in patency rates irrespective of location of Trans Atlantic Inter-Societal Consensus (TASC) classification, vessel treated (femoral vs tibial), or degree of stenosis (occluded vs stenotic). Also, multiple vessels treated in the same patients had no affect on patency. The mean ankle brachial index (ABI) pre-op was 0.57 +/- 0.19, and this increased to 0.81 +/- 0.21 (P < .001) at 30 days post-op.\nLower extremity atherectomy procedures with the SilverHawk device are safe and effective means in improving symptoms. However, there is decreased durability and significant patency and limb loss over time. Diabetes, renal disease, tobacco use, and tissue loss are all associated with inferior outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Endovenous chemical ablation is a technique for treatment of great saphenous vein insufficiency. However, echogenic phenomena in the right heart and high intensity transient signals detected by transcranial Doppler have been described subsequent to foam sclerotherapy. An ischemic event after foam sclerotherapy of the great saphenous vein was reported recently in a patient with an occult patent foramen ovale. Another concern is the effects of sclerosant foam on the pulmonary microvasculature.\nThis study is a retrospective report comparing the utility of three commonly used techniques for reducing sclerosant foam migration during ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy of the great saphenous vein.\nGroup 1 consisted of 20 patients treated with ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy of the great saphenous vein while lying supine, with digital pressure used to occlude the saphenofemoral junction. In group 2, 19 patients underwent injection while the leg was elevated 30 degrees , with digital pressure at the saphenofemoral junction. Group 3 comprised 19 patients injected while the leg was elevated but without manual compression at the saphenofemoral junction. All patients were monitored with subcostal echocardiography during the injection and for 3 to 5 minutes after.\nEchogenic phenomena were demonstrated in the right heart in all 20 patients in group 1, in 16 of 19 in group 2, and in nine of 19 in group 3. There was a statistically significant difference in the incidence of echogenic phenomena between groups 1 and 3 using the Fisher exact test (P < .001). A significant difference in incidence was also present when groups 2 and 3 were compared (P < .038). In groups 1 and 2, a concentrated bolus of bubbles was frequently observed after release of digital pressure; however, less intense echogenic phenomena were seen in group 3 where injection was performed with the leg elevated but without manual pressure at the saphenofemoral junction. No echogenic phenomena were observed in the left heart, and no complications occurred. Short-term treatment results were equivalent among the three groups.\nUltrasound-guided sclerotherapy of the great saphenous vein using foam sclerosants is best performed with the leg elevated and no occlusive pressure at the saphenofemoral junction in order to reduce the risk of gas embolization to the central nervous system. Further study is needed to assess the midterm success of this technique and to confirm the effect of using foam produced from physiologic gases.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic coarctation is uncommon and often complicated with coexisting splanchnic and renal artery occlusive disease. This study was undertaken to define the clinical and anatomic characteristics of this entity, as well as the technical issues and outcomes of its operative treatment.\nFifty-three patients, 34 males and 19 females, underwent surgical treatment of abdominal aortic coarctations from 1963-2008 at the University of Michigan. Patient ages in years ranged from 2-4 (n = 4), 5-8 (n = 17), 9-14 (n = 16), 15-20 (n = 11) and 25-49 (n = 5). The mean age was 11.9 years. Developmental disease (n = 48), inflammatory aortitis (n = 4), and iatrogenic trauma (n = 1) were suspected etiologies. Aortic coarctations were suprarenal (n = 37), intrarenal (n = 12), or infrarenal (n = 4). Patients often had coexisting occlusive disease of the splanchnic (n = 33) and renal (n = 46) arteries.\nMajor clinical manifestations included: aortic and renal artery-related secondary hypertension (n = 50), symptomatic lower extremity ischemia (n = 3), and intestinal angina (n = 3). Primary aortic reconstructive procedures included: thoracoabdominal bypass (n = 26), patch aortoplasty (n = 24), or an aortoaortic interposition graft (n = 3). Primary splanchnic (n = 19) or renal (n = 47) arterial reconstructions were performed as simultaneous (n = 45) or staged (n = 13) procedures in relation to the aortic surgery. Benefits existed regarding improved control of hypertension (n = 46), as well as elimination of extremity ischemia (n = 3) and mesenteric angina (n = 3). Secondary renal or splanchnic arterial reoperations (n = 8) were performed without mortality 5 days to 12 years postoperative for failed primary procedures. Secondary aortic procedures, 5 to 14 years postoperative, were performed for patch aortoplasties that became stenotic (n = 2) or aneurysmal (n = 1), and when thoracoabdominal bypasses developed an anastomotic narrowing (n = 1) or proved inadequate in size with patient growth (n = 1). No perioperative mortality accompanied either the primary or secondary aortic reconstructive procedures.\nAbdominal aortic coarctation represents a complex vascular disease. Individualized treatment changed little over the period of study, remaining dependent on the pattern of anatomic lesions, patient age, and anticipated growth potential. This experience documented salutary outcomes exceeding 90% following carefully performed operative therapy.",

The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes of our series of patients who underwent redo VAP aneurysm open surgery (conventional group) with a selected group of high-risk patients who underwent, in the same time period from 2001-2007, an alternative hybrid surgical and endovascular approach (hybrid group).\nConventional group: Twelve patients (11 males, median age 71.5 years, range, 65 to 77 years) underwent VAP aneurysm (median maximum diameter 62 mm, range, 52 to 75 mm) repair with re-inclusion technique via redo thoracophrenolaparotomy or bilateral subcostal laparotomy. Reimplantation of a single undersized VAP or separate revascularization of one or more visceral arteries was performed. Hybrid group: Seven patients (5 males, median age 70 years, range, 63 to 78 years) defined as at high risk for conventional surgery having American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class 3 or 4 associated with a preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <50% or an ejection fraction <40%, underwent VAP aneurysm (median maximum diameter 73 mm, range, 62 to 84 mm) repair via median laparotomy, visceral arteries rerouting, and VAP aneurysm exclusion using commercially available thoracic aortic endografts.\nConventional group: Perioperative mortality was 16.7% and major morbidity 33.3%. One perioperative anuria was successfully treated with bilateral renal artery stenting. No paraplegia or paraparesis were observed. At a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 1.6-7 years), we observed one case of peri-graft fluid collection with sepsis at postoperative day 46 requiring surgical drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy and one case of renal failure at day 68 requiring permanent hemodialysis. Hybrid group: perioperative mortality was 14.3% and major morbidity 28.6% with one case of transient delayed paraplegia. At a median follow-up of 1.9 years (range, 0.3-6.8 years), we observed one case of late pancreatitis (46 days postoperatively) resolved with pharmacologic treatment and one death due to an acute visceral grafts thrombosis (78 days postoperatively). We did not observe other procedure-related deaths or complications, VAP aneurysm growth, endoleak, and endograft migration.\nHybrid repair is clearly a feasible alternative to simple observation for patients unfit for redo VAP aneurysm open surgery. However, despite our promising early results, new mid-term specific procedure-related complications have been observed and a widespread use of this technique should be currently limited until longer-term follow-up is available.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) contribute to vascular regeneration. Since surgical injury and burns induce a pro-inflammatory and proangiogenic response, we investigated the effect of vascular injury with minimal surgical trauma after endarterectomy on the number of circulating EPC and systemic inflammatory changes.\nForty-five patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease were included in the study. Venous blood samples were taken before and 1 day after endarterectomy and plaque material was obtained. Ten patients with minor surgery served as controls. Circulating CD133+CD34+, VEGFR-2+CD34+ progenitor cells and surface expression of CD11b on circulating neutrophils were analysed using flow cytometry. EPCs were characterized in a culture assay as double-positive for DiI-LDL uptake and lectin binding. Cytokine concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1ss, IL-10, IL-12, SDF-1, G-CSF, and VEGF were measured in plasma and tissue samples. After endarterectomy a significant decrease in circulating EPC, CD133+CD34+, and VEGFR-2+CD34+ cells was observed. This was associated with a specific pattern of changes in circulating cytokine levels after endarterectomy with a decrease in IL-1 beta and IL-12, an increase in IL-6 and G-CSF plasma concentrations, and surface expression of CD11b on circulating neutrophils. In contrast, after minor surgery an increase in circulating CD133+CD34+ cells, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 was found. Interestingly there was a negative association between levels of local IL-6 within the plaque and only the preoperative levels of circulating CD133+C34+.\nEndarterectomy induces changes in circulating cytokines and a decline in circulating progenitor cells, which may be due to recruitment of progenitor cells to the injured vessels. This is supported by the negative association between plaque inflammation and circulating progenitor cells before endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "Minimally invasive techniques such as endovenous laser therapy, radiofrequency ablation, and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy are widely used in the treatment of lower extremity varicosities. These therapies have not yet been compared with surgical ligation and stripping in large randomized clinical trials.\nA systematic review of Medline, Cochrane Library, and Cinahl was performed to identify studies on the effectiveness of the four therapies up to February 2007. All clinical studies (open, noncomparative, and randomized clinical trials) that used ultrasound examination as an outcome measure were included. Because observational and randomized clinical trial data were included, both the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and Quality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses (QUORUM) guidelines were consulted. A random effects meta-analysis was performed, and subgroup analysis and meta-regression were done to explore sources of between-study variation.\nOf the 119 retrieved studies, 64 (53.8%) were eligible and assessed 12,320 limbs. Average follow-up was 32.2 months. After 3 years, the estimated pooled success rates (with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) for stripping, foam sclerotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and laser therapy were about 78% (70%-84%), 77% (69%-84%), 84% (75%-90%), and 94% (87%-98%), respectively. After adjusting for follow-up, foam therapy and radiofrequency ablation were as effective as surgical stripping (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.12 [95% CI, -0.61 to 0.85] and 0.43 [95% CI, -0.19 to 1.04], respectively). Endovenous laser therapy was significantly more effective compared with stripping (AOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.40-1.87), foam therapy (AOR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.28-1.75), and radiofrequency ablation (AOR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.15-1.27).\nIn the absence of large, comparative randomized clinical trials, the minimally invasive techniques appear to be at least as effective as surgery in the treatment of lower extremity varicose veins.",

    "abstract": "The relevance of venous valves in varicose veins is still discussed controversially as, among others, the veins' wall weakness is accused to be the initial trigger of varicose veins. Thorough knowledge of their positions and frequencies will support understanding the pathogenesis of varices. Contrary to the incidences of valves in the femoral vein, no sufficient data about the positions of valves, particularly in respect to the saphenofemoral junction, are available; specifically in conjunction with the fact that terminal and preterminal valves in the great saphenous vein are missing in 10% of cases.\nThe exact positions and distances of valves in both the common femoral and the femoral vein close to the saphenofemoral junction were studied macroscopically in 32 cadavers with a total of 63 veins. Measurements were performed from the saphenofemoral junction as reference point above and below.\nValves in the common femoral vein exist in 71% of all cases with a mean distance of 3.8 cm proximally to the saphenofemoral junction. Distal valves are present in 87% of all cases with a mean distance of 5.0 cm. In more than a half, a second distal valve can be found at about 9 cm, which has not been described yet. Females have a significantly shorter mean distance of this second distal valve on the right side.\nIncorporating the study results on terminal and preterminal valves in the great saphenous vein, we have a well defined overview about the positions of the valves and frequencies in the coherent area of confluence of the superficial inguinal veins. More than ever, further studies, mainly about the real functions of valves, are necessary.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the safety and clinical and anatomic effectiveness of endovenous laser therapy (EVLT) and microphlebectomy in the treatment of varicose veins secondary to saphenous reflux.\nFrom January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2007, 1985 EVLT procedures were performed in 1559 eligible patients (1263 women) with a mean age of 52.8 years (range, 18-89 years). A 810-nm diode laser and microphlebectomy were used. All sites of superficial axial reflux above and below the knee were ablated. Symptoms of venous insufficiency were present in 97%, and 102 patients (6.54%) had an open ulcer when they underwent operation. Patients had clinical follow-up visits, including duplex ultrasound examination, at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and yearly and were assessed for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), recanalization of the ablated vein, nerve injury, ulcer healing, and resolution of symptoms.\nA total of 1652 great saphenous veins (83.22%), 285 small saphenous veins (14.36%), 40 anterolateral tributaries (2.02%), and 8 posteromedial tributaries (0.40%) were ablated. An average of 19 phlebectomies were performed per case treated (range, 1-58). The primary ablation rate at 15 and 30 months was 91.26% and 78.25% by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Recanalization occurred in 35 veins (1.76%); in this group, 15 (42.9%) exhibited symptoms of venous insufficiency and were successfully closed with a second EVLT. Body mass index >30 kg/m(2) and a vein diameter >/=8.5 mm were the only factors predictive of recanalization. Postoperatively, the 102 ulcers showed healing at a mean of 5.2 weeks (range, 2-10 weeks), and only three reopened (2.94%). No major complications occurred. Two DVT (0.13%) occurred, but no pulmonary emboli or skin burns. Local transient paresthesia at the ankle and midcalf level occurred in 38 patients (2.43%).\nEVLT of all sites of superficial axial reflux above and below the knee and microphlebectomy demonstrated that the combined approach is safe and effective at eliminating reflux, affording symptomatic relief, and healing ulcers. It offers the additional advantage of resolving varicose veins and its cause in just one visit, leading to immediate better cosmetic results.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous intervention for symptomatic renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) has replaced surgical therapy as first-line treatment. This study evaluates the factors that impact long-term anatomic and functional outcomes of endovascular therapy for symptomatic renal artery FMD.\nRecords of patients who underwent renal artery angioplasty for FMD between January 1990 and December 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. Indication for intervention was poorly controlled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg, or both, taking >2 antihypertensive medications). Twenty-nine women (average age, 45 years [range, 18-80]; 86% with a history of hypertension <8 years) underwent 38 attempted interventions. Sixty-six percent of contralateral kidneys were normal (31% had a </=60% stenosis), 13% had >60% stenosis, and the remainder were nonfunctioning or absent. Creatinine was >1.5 mg/dL in 4%, 24% had hyperlipidemia, 17% had metabolic syndrome, and 4% were considered diabetic.\nAll interventions were successfully performed. Stent placement was required in 13% for technical failure and flow-limiting dissection. Seventy-three percent of these lesions were in the proximal renal artery, with the remainder in the middle renal artery. Technical success (<30% residual stenosis) was achieved in all vessels. There were no periprocedural or 90-day deaths. The procedurally related complication rate was 8%. Median follow-up was 2 years. All patients were alive at follow-up. Primary and assisted primary patency rates were 66% and 87% at 5 years. Restenosis was considered a 50% reduction in luminal area on angiography during follow-up. The restenosis rate was 28% at 5 years (10 vessels underwent repeat percutaneous intervention). Immediate clinical benefit was seen in hypertension in 72% (improved or cured </=3 months) and was maintained in 73% at 5 years by life-table analysis. Proportional hazard analysis showed the predictors of long-term clinical benefit were duration of hypertension <8 years, creatinine <1.5 mg/dL, ipsilateral kidney size >9 cm, functional status of the contralateral kidney, a fasting blood glucose <110 mg/dL, triglycerides <150 mg/dL, and high-density lipoprotein >50 mg/dL. Neither age <50 years nor statin administration appeared significant.\nPercutaneous endovascular intervention for clinically symptomatic FMD in the renal arteries is technically successful, safe, and durable. Most patients have immediate clinical benefit, with continued long-term results out to 5 years. It appears that the presence of existing renal pathology and markers of prediabetic state are associated with recurrence of hypertensive symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Reversal of flow in the extracranial vertebral artery secondary to a proximal subclavian/innominate artery stenosis or occlusion is a frequent finding during carotid duplex ultrasonography. The characteristics of basilar artery flow are not well defined in these patients. The objective of this study is to evaluate basilar artery flow in patients with retrograde vertebral artery flow.\nFrom a transforaminal vice transforamen approach with the patient seated, pulsed Doppler scan spectral waveforms were obtained from the distal segment of each vertebral artery (depths of 66 mm and 70 mm) and throughout the basilar artery (depths of 80 mm up to 116 mm). The direction of flow and the peak flow velocity were recorded at each location. In the subset of patients with antegrade flow, we initiated a 5-minute period of arm ischemia (produced by brachial blood pressure cuff inflated to a suprasystolic pressure) and compared flow direction to baseline.\nTwenty-five patients with retrograde vertebral artery flow on carotid duplex ultrasonography underwent transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography scan of the distal vertebral arteries and the basilar artery. There were 10 males (58-85-years-old; mean 70.7 years) and 15 females (47-85-years-old; mean 66.0 years). An additional 11 patients who had normal vertebral flow underwent TCD and served as a control group. Nineteen patients (76%) demonstrated antegrade basilar artery flow at rest. Six patients (24%) demonstrated abnormal basilar artery flow at rest. Five had complete reversal of flow; one had intermittent flow reversal which became retrograde throughout the cardiac cycle following a period of arm ischemia ipsilateral to the patient's retrograde vertebral artery flow. No patient with retrograde vertebral artery flow and antegrade basilar artery flow at rest demonstrated a change in basilar artery peak velocity or direction of flow following arm ischemia.\nLess than 25% of patients with retrograde vertebral artery flow on carotid duplex ultrasonography scan demonstrated a corresponding reversal of flow in the basilar artery. The vast majority of patients do not develop flow reversal in the basilar artery. Provocative maneuvers to increase collateral flow to the arm ipsilateral to retrograde vertebral artery flow did not appear to alter basilar artery flow velocity or direction of flow. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography is indicated in patients with retrograde vertebral artery flow to document basilar artery flow, especially prior to intervention in patients with symptoms suggestive of posterior cerebral circulation insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "Controlled hypotension is sometimes necessary for accurate endograft deployment and adjunctive ballooning and stenting near the arch and proximal descending thoracic aorta. This article describes a technique in which a compliant occlusion balloon inflated in the right atrium is used to occlude the inflow from the inferior vena cava and reduce the cardiac preload. This reliably and effectively induces systemic hypotension to any desired level and is also able to be rapidly reversed. The technique has been used in 11 cases of thoracic endovascular aortic repairs with complete success and no procedure-related complications.",

    "abstract": "The relative efficacy and safety of endarterectomy and stenting in patients with carotid stenosis remain unclear. In this review we synthesize the available evidence derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the two procedures in terms of the risks of death, stroke (disabling and nondisabling), and nonfatal myocardial infarction.\nWe searched for RCTs in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, and Cochrane CENTRAL; expert files, and bibliographies of included articles. Two reviewers, working independently, determined trial eligibility and extracted descriptive, methodologic, and outcome data from each eligible RCT. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to assess relative and absolute risks and the I(2) statistic was used to assess heterogeneity of treatment effect among trials.\nTen RCTs with 3182 participants proved eligible. At 30 days and compared with endarterectomy, carotid stenting was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of death (relative risk [RR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-1.37; I(2) = 0%), a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction (RR, 0.43; 95% CI 0.17-1.11; I(2) = 0%), and a nonsignificant increase in the risk of any stroke (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.73-2.26; I(2) = 40%) and major/disabling stroke (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.32-3.52; I(2) = 45%). If one considers the two procedures equivalent if the absolute difference in events is <2%, these results provide moderate-quality evidence for equivalence with respect to death (risk difference [RD] -0.40, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.40) and nonfatal myocardial infarction (RD, -0.70; 95% CI -1.90 to 0.50), but because of much wider CI, only low-quality evidence of equivalence in stroke (RD, 1.00; 95% CI, -1.00 to 3.10).\nIn RCTs, carotid stenting and carotid endarterectomy seem equivalent in terms of death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Although the impact on stroke remains unestablished, results are consistent with a clinically important increase in stroke risk with stenting, an intervention that aims at reducing the risk of stroke.",

    "abstract": "The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) appointed a committee of experts to formulate evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of carotid stenosis. In formulating clinical practice recommendations, the committee used systematic reviews to summarize the best available evidence and the GRADE scheme to grade the strength of recommendations (GRADE 1 for strong recommendations; GRADE 2 for weak recommendations) and rate the quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, and very low quality). In symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with low-grade carotid stenosis (<50% in symptomatic and <60% in asymptomatic patients), we recommend optimal medical therapy rather than revascularization (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). In symptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (more than 50%), we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus optimal medical therapy (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). In symptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (>/=50%) and high perioperative risk, we suggest carotid artery stenting as a potential alternative to carotid endarterectomy (GRADE 2 recommendation, low quality evidence). In asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (>/=60%), we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus medical management as long as the perioperative risk is low (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence). We recommend against carotid artery stenting for asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe (>/=60%) carotid artery stenosis (GRADE 1 recommendation, low quality evidence). A possible exception includes patients with >/=80% carotid artery stenosis and high anatomic risk for carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "Determine the prevalence and clinical significance of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the asymptomatic contralateral extremity of patients referred to the vascular laboratory with unilateral symptoms and DVT confirmed by duplex scan.\nFrom December 2003 to October 2006, a total of 4813 patients were referred to our vascular laboratory for unilateral venous duplex scans. We prospectively studied 239 patients who were found to have acute DVT and had unilateral symptoms. Contralateral examinations were performed and demographic data, including risk factors for DVT, were entered into a computerized database.\nOf the 239 patients, 133 (55.6%) had a major DVT (popliteal vein or above) and 106 (44.4%) had a calf vein DVT. The majority were outpatients (195, 81.6%) and the rest were inpatients (44, 18.4%). The contralateral leg was normal in 192 (80.3%) patients, whereas 47 (19.7%) patients had some evidence of venous thrombosis. These thromboses consisted of acute major DVT (18/47, 38.3%), acute calf vein DVT (14/47, 29.8%), and less clinically significant chronic or superficial thrombus (15/47 (31.9%). All 18 patients with major contralateral DVT had underlying risk factor for thrombosis: active malignancy (12/18), recent surgery (4/18), or trauma (2/18). Patients with asymptomatic contralateral calf vein involvement often had thrombotic risk factors (10/14) but occasionally did not (4/14). Patients with an active malignancy were significantly more likely to have DVT in the asymptomatic leg (18/47, 38.3%) than were patients without cancer (23/192, 12%; both P < .0001). Inpatients were much more likely to have contralateral asymptomatic thrombosis (15/44, 34.1%) than outpatients (31/195, 15.9%; both P < .006). If treatment had been based on the findings in the symptomatic leg, all but 2 of the 239 patients would have been adequately treated. These two patients had multiple thrombotic risk factors that should have precluded ordering of a unilateral examination.\nInpatients have a very high incidence of clinically silent contralateral thrombosis (34%) and should usually undergo bilateral examinations. Patients with active malignancy have a 38% incidence of asymptomatic contralateral clot and should always have a bilateral study. Outpatients with unilateral symptoms and no associated risk factors for thrombosis can safely undergo unilateral examinations and should be adequately treated according to the unilateral findings. Algorithms to select patients for limited studies should include screening data for active malignancy, recent trauma or surgery, pregnancy, hormone therapy, or history of thrombophilia.",

    "abstract": "Twenty to thirty percent of patients with symptomatic chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) are found to have combined superficial and deep venous reflux on duplex testing. It is currently unclear whether endovenous ablation (EVA) of the saphenous vein will result in correction of CVI without addressing the deep venous reflux. In this study, we examined deep venous reflux velocities to determine whether these would predict outcome after endovenous ablation.\nPatients with symptomatic CVI and both saphenous and deep venous reflux were identified using duplex ultrasonography. Reflux times and maximal reflux velocity (MRV) in each examined vein segment were determined. In each limb, the venous filling index (VFI) and the venous clinical severity score (VCSS) were obtained both before and after laser ablation of the great and/or small saphenous veins. Preoperative venous reflux velocities were correlated with improvement in VFI and VCSS after ablation.\n75 limbs with both deep and superficial venous reflux were identified. Seventy-five percent of limbs were CEAP clinical class 3 or 4 and the other 25% were class 5 or 6. Forty limbs demonstrated deep venous reflux in the femoral and/or popliteal vein. After EVA, significant improvements in VFI and VCSS were seen, but this depended on MRV in the deep vein. When MRV in the popliteal or femoral vein was <10 cm/sec, limbs had significantly better outcomes than limbs with MRV >10 cm/sec as measured by both VFI (P = .01) and VCSS (P = .03). In 35 limbs, deep venous reflux was identified only in the CFV. In this group, the average pre-procedure VFI (6.54 +/- 3.9 cc/sec) decreased significantly to 2.2 +/- 1.9 cc/sec (P < .001) and the VCSS improved markedly from 7.0 +/- 2.8 to 1.3 +/- 1.4 (P < .001).\nEVA of the saphenous veins can be performed in patients with concomitant deep venous insufficiency with hemodynamic and clinical improvement in most cases. Patients with popliteal or femoral reflux velocities lower than 10 cm/sec usually experience marked improvement in both the VFI and the VCSS. Patients with femoral or popliteal reflux velocities greater than 10 cm/sec have a high incidence of persistent symptoms after EVA.",

    "abstract": "Stenosis of the cephalad internal carotid artery (ICA) can present a challenge, making it difficult to obtain a technically satisfying distal end point during endarterectomy. Surgical revision of distal defects can be difficult and yield unsatisfactory results. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative carotid stenting as an adjunct to endarterectomy to salvage technical defects identified at the cephalad ICA endarterectomy site.\nBetween January 2001 and February 2008, 14 patients were found to have technical defects located at the cephalad ICA endarterectomy site on intraoperative completion arteriogram. All defects were treated with adjunctive carotid stenting. Patient age ranged from 53 to 84 years (mean, 69 years). Indications for surgery were asymptomatic stenosis (nine), amaurosis fugax (two), and cerebrovascular accident (three). Operative time ranged from 2 to 5 hours (mean, 2.5 hours). Cervical block was used in all but two patients who received general anesthesia.\nTechnically satisfying results with stenting were achieved in all 14 patients. One patient suffered a perioperative transient ischemic attack; however, neurologic symptoms were noted before placement of the stent in this patient. There were no stent-related complications. All stents remained patent on duplex follow-up averaging 18 months.\nIntraoperative salvage carotid stenting is an effective and safe adjunct to endarterectomy when unsatisfactory technical defects are identified at the cephalad ICA endarterectomy site.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to achieve accurate statistical modeling of a putative relationship between carotid endarterectomy (CEA) annual surgeon and hospital volume and in-hospital mortality.\nWe performed a secondary data analysis of 10 years (1994-2003) of the Maryland hospital discharge database. Annual volume was defined as the total number of procedures performed for the time in the dataset divided by the total years in the dataset. Non-linear relationships between death and average volumes were explored with logit-transformed lowess smoothing functions, followed by random effect models and inspection of data likelihood under each combination of spline knots. A marginal model with generalized estimating equations was used to represent population-average response as a function of covariates and to account for clustering in the data. Patient comorbidity was assessed using the Deyo modification of the Charlson Index.\nThe Maryland hospital discharge database is a 100% sample of all hospitals in the state.\nCEA was identified through ICD-9 and diagnosis codes, using a previously reported algorithm.\nEstimated odds ratios predicting in-hospital death, alpha set at 0.05.\nDuring the study period, 22,772 patients with surgeon identifiers underwent CEA in Maryland, resulting in 123 in-hospital deaths (0.54%). The crude odds ratio of death for the entire surgeon dataset was 0.9838, meaning that the odds of death decreased by an average of 0.0162 for each additional annual procedure. Surgeon volume of four to 15 CEAs per year was highly significant: for an increase in annual surgeon volume by one procedure per year, the estimated odds of death decreased by 0.065 when controlling for hospital volume, age, and comorbidity (P = .351). Surgeons in other volume categories also demonstrated lower odds of death with increased annual volume, but these odds ratios did not attain statistical significance. Surgeons performing </=3 CEA per year had an odds ratio of death of 0.802 per additional annual procedure (P = .351), whereas those performing >15 CEAs per year had an odds ratio of 0.997 (P = .485). Hospitals that saw >130 CEAs per year had an odds ratio of death of 0.945 per additional procedure, or 0.055 decrease in the odds of death (P = 0.013), whereas hospitals performing </=130 CEAs per year had an odds ratio of 0.998 (P = 0.563).\nWe have demonstrated a technique for rigorous statistical analysis of volume-outcome data and have found a volume effect for death after CEA in this 10-year Maryland dataset. Higher volume surgeons had lower estimated odds of death, particularly those performing four to 15 CEAs per year. These data suggest that a patient undergoing CEA by a surgeon performing an average of 16 CEAs annually has a statistically equivalent risk of death compared with one undergoing CEA by a surgeon performing any number higher than this, when controlling for hospital volume, patient comorbidity, and patient age. Hospital volume was not seen to be as significant a predictor of postoperative death in this study, with only high volume hospitals (>/=130 CEAs per year) showing a statistically significant decrease in the odds ratio of death. As studies on volume-outcome relationships can have important implications for health policy and surgical training, such studies should consider non-linear effects in their modeling of procedural volume.",

Only one patient was treated with an endovascular procedure. Mean patient age was 59.3 years (range, 36-78 years). The site of aneurysmal disease was splenic artery in 30 (50.8%) cases, renal artery in nine (15.2%) cases, common hepatic artery in seven (11.9%) cases, pancreaticoduodenal artery in four (6.8%) cases, celiac trunk in three (5.1%) cases, superior mesenteric artery in two (3.4%) cases, and gastroduodenal, inferior mesenteric, middle colic and right gastroepiploic in one (1.7%) case for each artery. Two (3.6%) patients had multiple VAAs. In five (9.1%) patients, an abdominal aortic aneurysm coexisted. Early results in terms of mortality and major complications were assessed. Follow-up consisted of clinical and ultrasound examinations at 1 and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Long-term results in terms of survival and aneurysm-related complications were analyzed.\nIn all but two cases, elective intervention in asymptomatic patients was performed. Two (3.6%) patients had a ruptured aneurysm (one pancreaticoduodenal artery and one middle colic artery). The one perioperative death was due to an acute pancreatitis in a patient operated on for a giant inflammatory splenic artery aneurysm, yielding a perioperative mortality rate of 1.8%. Two major complications (retroperitoneal hematoma and acute pancreatitis) were recorded. Mean duration of follow-up was 82.1 months (range, 0-324 months). Estimated 10-year survival rate was 79.5%. During follow-up two aneurysm-related complications occurred, with an estimated 10-year, aneurysm-related, complication-free survival rate of 75.2%.\nIn the era of minimally invasive therapeutic approaches, elective open surgical treatment of visceral artery aneurysms is safe and effective, and offers satisfactory early and long-term results.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the values of the hemodynamic parameters of Doppler sonography in the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis (RAS) (diameter reduction >/=50%) and to investigate their possible influencing factors.\nFive Doppler parameters, including renal peak systolic velocity (RPSV), renal-aortic ratio (RAR), renal-renal ratio (RRR), renal-segmental ratio (RSR), and renal-interlobar ratio (RIR), were measured in 81 patients before arteriography. Arteries with >/=50% diameter reduction were considered stenosed at renal arteriography. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal parameters. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy at various threshold values were calculated.\nSixteen accessory renal arteries (15 normal, one mild stenosis) were identified at arteriography. Of the 153 main renal arteries demonstrated at arteriography, 79 were normal or demonstrated stenosis <50%, 68 demonstrated moderate stenosis (50%-99%), and 6 demonstrated total occlusion. Doppler sonographic examination was technically successful in 91.7% (154/168) of main and accessory renal arteries. The optimal threshold values of RPSV, RAR, RRR, RSR, and RIR were 170 cm/s, 2.3, 2.0, 4.0, and 5.5, respectively. The parameters RPSV, RSR, and RIR showed good diagnostic results with accuracies equal to or greater than 88%, whereas RAR and RRR presented a sensitivity of only 76.47%.

The PSVs in the abdominal aorta and renal artery can be affected by factors other than RAS, which may decrease the accuracy of RAR.

    "abstract": "Significant stent graft remodeling commonly occurs after endovascular repair of thoracic aortic dissections because of continuing expansion of the true lumen. A suboptimal proximal landing zone, minimal oversizing, and lack of a healthy distal attachment site are unique factors affecting long-term stent graft stability. We used computational fluid dynamic techniques to analyze the biomechanical factors associated with stent graft remodeling in these patients.\nA series of computational fluid dynamic models were constructed to investigate the biomechanical factors affecting the drag force on a thoracic stent graft. The resultant drag force as a net change of fluid momentum was calculated on the basis of varying three-dimensional geometry and deployment positions. A series of 12 patients with type B aortic dissections treated by thoracic stent graft and followed up for more than 12 months were then studied. Computed tomography transaxial images of each patient shortly after stent graft deployment and on subsequent follow-up were used to generate three-dimensional geometric models that were then fitted with a surface mesh. Computational fluid dynamic simulations were then performed on each stent graft model according to its geometric parameters to determine the actual change in drag force experienced by the stent graft as it remodels over time.\nThe drag force on the stent graft model increases linearly with its internal diameter and becomes highest when the deployment position is closer to the proximal arch. Aortic curvature is not a significant factor. Serial computed tomography scans of patients showed an increase in mean inlet area from 1030 mm(2) to 1140 mm(2), and mean outlet area from 586 mm(2) to 884 mm(2) (increase of 11% and 58%, respectively; P = .05, .01). These increases are associated with a change in resultant drag force on the stent graft from 21.0 N to 24.8 N (mean increase, 19.5%; range, 0%-63.2%; P = .002). There is a positive relationship between increase in drag force and increase in stent-graft area.\nThe drag force on thoracic stent grafts is high. A significant change in stent-graft diameter occurs after endovascular repair for type B dissections, which is associated with an increase in hemodynamic drag force. These stent grafts may be subjected to a higher risk of distal migration, and continuing surveillance is mandatory.",

In 15 patients (83%), no protective measure of the kidney was used. In seven patients, the reconstruction remained proximal to the renal artery whereas in 11 patients it required the reattachment of the artery to the prosthesis.\nThere was no mortality after the operation. A moderate increase of blood creatinine occurred in all patients but by the end of the tenth postoperative day, all patients had regained renal function identical to the preoperative state. In the long-term follow-up, nine late deaths occurred, mainly due to myocardial infarct (N = 7), and chronic rejection led to hemodialysis in three patients. Six patients are alive with a functioning transplant. The follow-up ranges from 5 to 30 years.\nOpen repair of aortoiliac aneurysms can be safely undertaken in renal transplant recipients without protection of the transplanted kidney. In the long-term follow-up, these patients are exposed to complications of general arteriosclerosis and to rejection of their transplanted kidney. Aortic aneurysms following kidney transplantation are likely to become more frequent in the future due to extension of renal transplantation to older and severely arteriosclerotic patients.",

    "abstract": "Recommended postoperative surveillance after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) includes serial contrast-enhanced CT scans. The cumulative deleterious effect on renal function, radiation exposure, and significant cost of this surveillance regimen are all problematic. However, there are scant data to support modulation of current post-EVAR surveillance regimens.\nThe study comprised patients who underwent EVAR as part of the prospective multicenter pivotal (phase II) and continued-access (phase III) US Zenith Endovascular (Cook, Bloomington, Ind) graft trials. A core lab prospectively recorded patient data. A composite aneurysm-related morbidity (ARM) variable was calculated to include aneurysm rupture, open conversion, any secondary intervention, limb thrombosis, migration, renal morbidity, or aneurysm-related death. The long-term freedom from ARM as a function of the presence or cumulative absence of any endoleak at 1, 6, and 12 months was analyzed. The potential additive predictive utility of aneurysm sac shrinkage (>/=5 mm) was assessed at 12 months. The instructions for use for aortic neck anatomy (>/=15 mm length, 18 to 28 mm diameter, </=60 degrees angulation) were followed.\nEVAR was done in 739 patients (mean follow-up, 29.9 +/- 17.1 months). Freedom from endoleak at 1 month was highly predictive (P < .001) of reduced ARM: freedom from ARM was 92.3%, 89.8%, 85.2%, 83.1% and 83.1 % at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, in patients without endoleak (83.1%) and 75%, 67.1%, 61.5%, 55.9%, and 55.9% in patients with endoleak (16.9%). Cumulative absence of endoleak at 1 year (77.6%) was associated with 94%, 91.5%, 88.1%, 85.8%, and 85.8% 1- to 5-year freedom from ARM vs 73.3%, 66.7%, 56.6%, 52.5%, and 52.5% in patients with endoleak </=1 year (22.4%), P < .001. In patients without endoleak at 12 months, the subsequent risk of any ARM was 8.2% (5-year risk, 14.2%; 1-year risk, 6.0%). In patients with significant sac shrinkage (>/=5 mm) and cumulative absence of endoleak at 12 months, the subsequent risk of an ARM was 5.3% (5-year risk, 11.1%; 1-year risk, 5.8%).\nAbsence of endoleak at 30 and 365 days predicted greatly improved long-term freedom from ARM compared with early endoleak. A new EVAR surveillance regimen is recommended that modulates the intensity and frequency of postoperative imaging based on these early outcomes. In patients without early endoleak, the 6-month surveillance is eliminated, and aortic ultrasound is suggested for long-term surveillance >1 year. In most patients, this reduced surveillance regimen would be appropriate and could improve patient safety by reducing the cumulative deleterious effects of intravenous contrast and radiation exposure while also reducing health care costs. These subjective recommendations would be ideally validated in a randomized, prospective trial.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the values of transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPo(2)) measurement in diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic patients and assessed its reproducibility.\nIn 60 diabetic patients (type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus) without signs of peripheral arterial disease or neuropathy, we measured TcPo(2) at the chest and foot and compared these measurements with 60 age- and sex-matched nondiabetic patients in a cross-sectional fashion. The reproducibility of TcPo(2) in terms of interobserver variability was also assessed.\nDiabetic patients had a mean +/- SD TcPo(2) value at the foot of 50.02 +/- 8.92 mm Hg, which was significantly lower compared with 56.04 +/- 8.80 mm Hg in nondiabetic patients (P < .001). At the chest wall, values for TcPo(2) were 51.77 +/- 11.15 mm Hg, and 58.22 +/- 12.47 mm Hg for diabetic patients and nondiabetic patients, respectively (P = .003). Regression analysis showed that TcPo(2)was significantly associated with diabetes mellitus (coefficient = -0.258; P = .004), and with having a first-degree relative with diabetes mellitus (coefficient = -0.265; P = .003). Furthermore, the interobserver variability showed a substantial correlation for both measurements at the chest (P < .001; r = 0.654; intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.79) and at the dorsum of the foot (P < .001; r = 0.426; ICC = 0.60).\nDiabetic patients without signs of peripheral disease or neuropathy had significantly lower TcPo(2) values compared with age- and sex-matched nondiabetic patients. The influence of the examiner on the variance in TcPo(2) measurements was relatively small. We advocate the use of TcPo(2) measurement in diabetic patients to detect subclinical microvascular impairment as an additional tool to assess peripheral vascular disease.",

We report the long-term outcomes of this approach.\nPatients undergoing CFA endarterectomy with simultaneous iliac stenting/stent grafting between 1997 and 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. Technical success, clinical and hemodynamic outcomes, and 5-year patency using life-table methodology were determined. Factors associated with reintervention and mortality were determined by logistic regression analysis.\nA total of 171 patients (mean age, 67 +/- 10 years; 38% female; 35% diabetic) underwent 193 CFA endarterectomies and iliac stent/stent grafting. Indications were rest pain (32%), tissue loss (22%), and claudication (46%).

    "abstract": "Whether or not to undergo surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and whether to have open or endovascular repair (EVAR), is a complex decision that relies heavily on patient preferences, and yet little is known about the patient perspective on informed consent in this context. This study explores patients' views on their decision-making processes and the quality of surgeon-patient communication during informed consent for AAA repair.\nWe conducted in-depth interviews with AAA patients (n = 20) who underwent open AAA repair, endovascular repair, or declined surgery. Data were independently transcribed and analyzed by a team of individuals with diverse backgrounds, using the constant comparative method of analysis and systematic coding procedures.\nPatients who had seen surgeons from academic, private practice, and VA settings were interviewed.\nPatients' opinions regarding the nature, scope, and content of informed consent for AAA repair.\nWe identified four central themes characterizing patients' experiences with informed consent for AAA repair: 1) patients did not appreciate the scope of their options; 2) patients demonstrated that they were not adequately informed prior to making a decision; 3) patients differed in the scope and content of information they desired during informed consent; and 4) trust in the surgeon had an impact on the informed consent process.\nOur research highlights the limitations of the informed consent encounter in the current clinical context, and points to several ways in which informed consent could be improved. Adapting the informed consent encounter to incorporate the patient's perspective is critical in order to ensure that the decision regarding AAA repair is consistent with the patient's informed preference.",

    "abstract": "Colonic ischemia (CI) is a known complication of both open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Despite a relatively low incidence of 1% to 6%, the associated morbidity and mortality are high. We sought to analyze factors that affect the development of CI on the basis of type of repair as well as associated outcomes from a large nationwide database.\nAll admissions undergoing AAA repair were selected from the 2003 and 2004 Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to compare outcome measures and identify independent predictors of development of colonic ischemic complications.\nWe identified 89,967 admissions for AAA repair (mean age, 69.9 years). Open elective repair was performed in 49% of cases, elective EVAR in 41%, and ruptured aneurysm repair in 9%. The overall incidence of CI was 2.2% (1941 cases); however, the incidence for specific procedures was significantly higher after repair of ruptured aneurysm (8.9%) and open elective repair (1.9%) than after EVAR (0.5%; both P < .001). Patients who developed CI were at increased risk for mortality (37.8% vs 6.7%), had longer hospital stays (21.5 vs 8.1 days), incurred higher hospital charges ($182,000 vs $77,000), and were less likely to be discharged home from hospital (36% vs 71%; all P < .001). Independent predictors of development of CI included ruptured aneurysm (odds ratio [OR] = 6.4), female gender (OR = 1.6) and, in the setting of elective repair, open operation (OR = 3.1). CI was found to be a strong independent predictor of mortality in evaluations of both the entire cohort (OR = 4.5) and the elective open repair and EVAR (OR = 2.4) subgroups.\nCI is significantly more common after open AAA repair and is associated with increased morbidity and a two- to fourfold increase in mortality.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the frequency and nature of incidental findings seen on computed tomography (CT) scans during preoperative and postoperative follow-up in patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nBetween January 1, 2000, and March 1, 2006, 176 consecutive patients who underwent EVAR at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were included in the study if all preoperative and postoperative surveillance CT scans were performed at our institution. Eighty-two patients, 26 women (32%) and 56 men (68%), met this criterion. Their mean age was 76 years (range, 51-103 years). Official CT scan reports were reviewed. Findings were considered primary incidental if they were noted on preoperative CT scans and secondary incidental if they appeared on surveillance CT scans but not on the preoperative study. Primary and secondary incidental findings were considered either benign (eg, gallstones, diverticulosis) or clinically significant if they warranted further workup (eg, suspicious masses or changes suggestive of malignancy, internal or diaphragmatic hernias, and diverticulitis). The median follow-up was 29 months (range, 3-60 months). Each incidental finding was counted only once, on the first scan in which it appeared.\nOf the 82 patients, 73 (89%) had at least one primary incidental finding, and 14 (19%) of these were clinically significant. Secondary incidental findings, many of which were clinically significant, continued to appear throughout the follow-up period. The most common clinically significant primary incidental finding was the presence of a lung mass (n = 4). The most common clinically significant secondary incidental findings were lung mass (n = 6), liver mass (n = 6), and pancreas mass (n = 3). There was a significant difference in the proportion of men to women in the group with clinically significant incidental findings vs the group without clinically significant incidental findings (P = .03959). Differences between the groups with respect to age or aneurysm size were not significant.\nCT scans yielded surprisingly large numbers of both primary and secondary incidental findings, many of which were clinically significant. Primary incidental findings were more common than secondary incidental findings; however, clinically significant findings were found at a consistent rate throughout the study period.",

    "abstract": "With the established computed tomographic (CT)- morphologic parameters, only the relative, but not the individual rupture risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), can be determined. So far, increased aortic 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) metabolism measured by positron emission tomography (PET) has been reported in AAA with increased rupture risk. The aim of the study was to analyze the histopathologic changes in AAA wall correlated with increased FDG uptake for further implications on aortic wall stability and AAA rupture risk.\nFifteen patients with asymptomatic (n = 12) and symptomatic (n = 3) AAA underwent FDG-PET/CT, followed by open AAA repair. FDG-PET/CT was used for precise localization of maximum FDG uptake, and the maximum standard uptake values (SUV(max)) were calculated. Biopsies of the AAA wall were operatively collected from areas with maximum FDG uptake, immunohistologically stained, and semiquantitatively analyzed for inflammatory infiltrates, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 expression, as well as for elastin and collagenous fibers.\nSymptomatic AAA showed significantly increased FDG uptake compared with asymptomatic AAA (SUV(max), 3.5 +/- 0.6 vs 7.5 +/- 3; P < .001). Thus, increased FDG uptake was correlated with higher densities of inflammatory infiltrates (r = +0.87, P < .01) and macrophage and T-cell infiltrations (r = +0.95, P < .01 and r = +0.66, P < .05), with higher MMP-9 expressions (r = +0.86; P < .01), and with reduction of collagen fiber (r = -0.76; P < .01) and VSMCs (r = -0.71; P < .01). Consecutive correlations were found for total inflammatory infiltrates, T lymphocytes, and macrophages with MMP-9 expression (r = +0.79, +0.79 and +0.74; P < .01). Moreover, MMP-9 expression was correlated with decreasing collagen fiber content (r = -0.53, P < .05) and VSMC density (r = -0.57, P < .05).\nMaximum aortic FDG uptake correlated significantly with inflammation, followed by increased MMP expression and histopathologic characteristics of aneurysm wall instability and clinical symptoms. Therefore, FDG-PET/CT might be a new diagnostic technique to study AAA disease in vivo and may contribute to improve prediction of individual AAA rupture risk.",

    "abstract": "The management of concurrent carotid and coronary artery disease is controversial. Although single-center observational studies have revealed acceptable outcomes of combined carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), community-based outcomes have been substantially inferior. Recently, carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been introduced for the management of high-risk patients with carotid stenosis, including those with severe coronary artery disease. This study was undertaken to evaluate the nationwide trends and outcomes of CAS before CABG vs combined CEA and CABG and to assess the risk for adverse events.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to identify patients discharged after concurrent carotid and coronary revascularization procedures. All patients that underwent CAS before CABG and combined CEA-CABG during the years 2000 to 2004 were included. The type of revascularization and major adverse events (ie, in-hospital stroke and death rates) were determined by cross-tabulating discharge diagnostic and procedural codes. Risk stratification was performed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Weighted exact Cochrane-Armitage trend test and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess the association between types of revascularization, comorbidities, complications, and risk-adjusted mortality.\nDuring the 5-year period, 27,084 concurrent carotid revascularizations and CABG were done. Of these, 96.7% underwent CEA-CABG, whereas only 3.3% (887 patients) had CAS-CABG. From 2000 to 2004, the proportion of patients undergoing CAS-CABG vs CEA-CABG did not significantly changed (P = .27). Patients undergoing CAS-CABG had fewer major adverse events than those undergoing CEA-CABG. CAS-CABG patients had a lower incidence of postoperative stroke (2.4% vs 3.9%), and combined stroke and death (6.9% v. 8.6%) than the combined CEA-CABG group (P < .001), although in-hospital death rates were similar (5.2% vs 5.4%). After risk-stratification, CEA-CABG patients had a 62% increased risk of postoperative stroke compared with patients undergoing CAS before CABG (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.5; P = .02). However, no differences in the risk of combined stroke and death were observed (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.9-1.6; P = NS).\nAlthough CAS may currently be performed for high-risk patients, it is still infrequently used in patients who require concurrent carotid and coronary interventions. In the United States, patients who undergo CAS-CABG have significantly decreased in-hospital stroke rates compared with patients undergoing CEA-CABG but similar in-hospital mortality. CAS may provide a safer carotid revascularization option for patients who require CABG.",

    "abstract": "Preservation of spinal cord blood supply during descending thoracic (TAA) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) surgery is mandatory to prevent neurologic complications. Although collateral arteries have been identified occasionally and are considered crucial for maintaining spinal cord function in the individual patient, their critical functionality is poorly understood and very little experience exists with visualization. This study investigated whether the preoperative and postoperative presence or absence of collateral arteries detected by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is related to spinal cord function during the intraoperative exclusion of the segmental supply to the Adamkiewicz artery.\nSpinal cord MRA was used to localize the Adamkiewicz artery and its segmental supplier in 85 patients scheduled for open elective surgery for TAA or TAAA. The segmental artery to the Adamkiewicz artery was inside the cross-clamped aortic area in 55 patients, and spinal cord supply was consequently dependent on collateral supply. In these 55 patients the presence of collaterals originating from arteries outside the cross-clamped aortic segment was related to changes in the intraoperative motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) that occurred before corrective measures. Twenty-one patients returned for postoperative MRA.\nA highly significant (P < .0015) relation was found between the presence of collaterals and intraoperative spinal cord function. In 30 of 31 patients (97%) in whom collaterals were identified, MEPs remained stable. The collaterals in most patients originated caudally to the distal clamp (eg, from the pelvic arteries), which were perfused by means of extracorporeal circulation during cross-clamping. The MEPs declined in 9 of 24 patients (38%) in whom no collaterals were preoperatively visualized. Postoperatively, the 21 patients who had MRA, including 10 in whom preoperatively no collaterals were found, displayed a well-developed collateral network.\nCollateral arteries supplying the spinal cord can be systematically visualized using MRA. Spinal cord blood supply during open aortic surgery may crucially depend on collateral arteries. Preoperatively identified collateral supply was 97% predictive for stable intraoperative spinal cord function. Patients in whom no collaterals can be depicted preoperatively are at increased risk for spinal cord dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "This prospective, observational study evaluated the safety and efficacy of superficial femoral artery autograft reconstruction in the treatment of popliteal artery aneurysms in the absence of a suitable saphenous vein.\nFrom March 1997 to April 2007, data from patients with popliteal artery aneurysms treated by superficial femoral artery reconstruction were prospectively collected in two centers. The procedure was performed through a medial approach. The superficial femoral artery was harvested in the upper third of the thigh and used as the conduit for reconstruction, and the harvested segment was replaced by a polytetrafluoroethylene graft. The patients were observed for survival, limb salvage, and reconstruction patency. The results were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.\nDuring the 10-year study period, 37 popliteal artery aneurysms in 32 patients (all men; median age, 71 years) were treated by reconstruction using the superficial femoral artery. Indications for surgical treatment were symptomatic or complicated aneurysms in 11 (30%). Four (11%) of the 37 popliteal artery aneurysms were thrombosed, and 33 (89%) were patent. At surgery, 35% had a single vessel runoff. Because of acute ischemia, reconstruction was performed as an emergency procedure in three patients (8%). There were no perioperative deaths, early amputations, or early thrombosis. The mean follow-up period was 36 months (range, 7-103 months). Two grafts thrombosed during follow-up. At 3 years, the primary and secondary patency rates were 86% and 96%, and overall limb salvage was 100%. Follow-up duplex ultrasonography did not detect any aneurysmal dilatation of the autograft.\nOur experience shows that superficial femoral arterial reconstruction is a safe and useful treatment option in patients with popliteal artery aneurysms who lack suitable saphenous veins. This reconstruction seems to be a good alternative to prosthetic bypass crossing the knee joint, and our results suggest that this study should be continued.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 10% of infrainguinal bypass surgeries are complicated by early conduit failure. The cause is unclear in most cases. A prospective study was conducted to monitor the development and function of platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin antibodies after infrainguinal bypass procedures and to evaluate their clinical significance in early graft occlusion.\nBlood samples were obtained before surgery and at the 7-, 14-, and 28-day postsurgical evaluation. Relevant demographic and laboratory data were collected, and plasma samples were assayed for the presence and function of PF4/heparin-antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a two-point platelet aggregation assay. All tests were performed in duplicate or triplicate.\nOf the 79 patients who were enrolled, 67 reported previous heparin exposure. Six patients (7.6%) tested positive for the presence of PF4/heparin antibodies before surgery with ELISA, and four of these (67%) also had a positive result on the aggregation assay. During the 28-day follow-up, 22 subjects (32%) converted to positive according to the ELISA results; and five (22.7%) of these also tested positive for platelet-activating antibodies. No participants presented with thrombocytopenia or a >/=50% decrease in platelet count during the study period. Early graft occlusion was detected in three patients, all with negative ELISA and functional assay results throughout the study.\nPatients undergoing vascular surgery frequently develop PF4/heparin antibodies, with platelet-activating antibodies detected in up to 11% of these individuals. However, thrombocytopenia and vascular graft thrombosis both appear to be an uncommon consequence.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, the Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative (DOQI) Guidelines have enhanced the longevity of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. Consequently, surgeons are increasingly challenged to provide vascular access for patients in whom options for access in the upper extremity have been expended. This situation is even more problematic in the morbidly obese patient on hemodialysis. Our group previously reported a high rate of infection and need for secondary interventions in obese patients with prosthetic femorofemoral accesses. We now report a series of patients who underwent placement of a prosthetic axilloaxillary loop access. This study presents our technique and evaluates our results, particularly as they relate to the obese patient.\nFrom January 1998 to May 2006, 34 prosthetic axilloaxillary loop accesses were placed in 32 patients with ESRD. Eleven patients (12 accesses) were obese, as defined by a body mass index >/=30 kg/m(2). Median follow-up was 16 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine primary and secondary patency as well as patient survival for the entire cohort and for the obese and nonobese patient cohorts. Survival curves were compared using the log-rank test for equality over strata.\nThe secondary patency rate was 59% at 1 year (median, 18 months). The 1-year patient survival was 69%. Infection occurred in 15% patients. Comparison of the obese vs nonobese cohorts demonstrated no statistically significant difference in 1-year primary patency (36% vs 10%, P = .17) or secondary patency (71% vs 65%, P = .34). There were no infections in the obese cohort.\nThese data show that the prosthetic axilloaxillary loop access has acceptable outcomes and should be considered the tertiary vascular access procedure of choice in the obese patient on hemodialysis.",

Patients who presented with pain, swelling, or signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism of <10 days were included. The DVT was diagnosed with duplex ultrasound (DUS) imaging. Patients were grouped by those having thrombosis in one venous segment (group A) or multiple levels (group B). Patients were treated with heparin and warfarin. Patients with at least 1-year of follow-up with clinical and DUS were included.\nNo difference was found in the duration of signs and symptoms at presentation. The median follow-up was 3.4 years (range, 1.2-7 years). More symptomatic limbs were seen in group B (71 of 79) compared with group A (21 of 41; P < .001). Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) was more advanced in group B vs group A, including the prevalence of skin damage and ulceration (61 of 79 vs 26 of 41, P < .001; 29 of 79 vs 6 of 41, P = .019, respectively). Limbs with calf DVT that had focal thrombosis were most often asymptomatic. Calf thrombosis in patients with proximal DVT produced the highest prevalence of PTS. Venous claudication was exclusively found in group B and was present only when iliac veins were involved. Recurrent thrombosis had a trend for a higher prevalence in group B (5 of 41 vs 16 of 79, P = .39). Reflux, obstruction, or a combination of the two were more common in group B (61 of 79) vs group A (15 of 41; P < .0001). Limbs with both reflux and obstruction were more likely to develop skin damage (group A, 5 of 6 vs 1 of 35, P < .0001; group B, 24 of 29 vs 5 of 50, P < .0001).\nRecurrent thrombosis and skin damage is more likely to develop in patients with multiple sites of thrombosis than in those with thrombosis in a single vein segment. Patients with reflux and obstruction presented more skin damage than those with reflux or obstruction alone. Involvement of the calf veins in the presence of proximal vein thrombosis increased the likelihood for PTS.",

    "abstract": "Increased venous hydrostatic pressure plays a role in the pathogenesis of varicose veins. Increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been identified in varicose veins. Also, we have shown that MMP-2 inhibits venous contraction. However, the relation between venous pressure, MMP expression, and venous dysfunction is unclear. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that prolonged increases in venous wall tension cause overexpression of MMPs and decreased contractility, which in turn promote venous dilation.\nCircular segments of inferior vena cava (IVC) were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats and suspended between two wires in Krebs solution. Preliminary vein wall tension-contraction relation showed maximal potassium chloride (KCl) (96 mmol/L) contraction at 0.5 g basal tension, which remained steady with increases in tension up to 2 g. Vein segments were subjected to either control (0.5 g) or high (2 g) basal tension for short (1 hour) or long duration (24 hours). Isometric contraction in response to phenylephrine (Phe, 10(-5) mol/L), angiotensin II (AngII, 10(-6) mol/L), and KCl was measured. The veins were frozen to determine the expression and localization of MMPs using immunoblots and immunohistochemistry.\nIn IVC segments subjected to 0.5 g tension for 1 hour, Phe and AngII produced significant contraction. At higher 2 g basal tension for 24 hours, both Phe and AngII contractions were significantly reduced. Reduction in KCl contraction was also observed at high 2 g basal tension for 24 hours, suggesting that the reduction in vein contraction is not specific to a particular receptor, and likely involves inhibition of a post-receptor contraction mechanism. In vein segments under 2 g tension for 24 hours and treated with TIMP-1, Phe, AngII, and KCl contractions were partially restored, suggesting the involvement of MMPs. IVC immunoblot analysis demonstrated prominent bands corresponding to MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein. High 2 g wall tension for 24 hours was associated with marked increase in the amount of MMP-2 and -9 relative to the housekeeping protein actin. There was a correlation between MMP expression and decreased vein contraction. Also, significant increases in MMP-2 and -9 immunostaining were observed in IVC segments subjected to high 2 g tension for 24 hours. Both MMP-2 and MMP-9 caused significant inhibition of Phe contraction in IVC segments.\nIn rat IVC, increases in magnitude and duration of wall tension is associated with reduced contraction and overexpression of MMP-2 and -9. In light of our findings that MMP-2 and -9 promote IVC relaxation, the data suggest that protracted increases in venous pressure and wall tension increase MMPs expression, which in turn reduce venous contraction and lead to progressive venous dilation.",

    "abstract": "This study determined the average estimated total costs after treatment for peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and evaluated the effect of postoperative complications and their consequences for the total costs.\nCost data on all admissions involving treatment for PAOD from January 2007 until July 2007 were collected. A prospective analysis was made using the patient-related risk factor and comorbidity (Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society of Cardiovascular Surgeons) classification, primary and secondary treatment, and prospectively registered complications. At admission, patients without complications were placed in group A, and those with complications were in group B. Prospectively registered complications were divided into patient management (I), surgical technique (II), patient's disease (III), and outside surgical department (IV). The consequences of these were divided into minor complication, no long-term consequence (1A), additional medication or transfusion (1B), surgical reoperation (2A), prolonged hospital stay (2B), irreversible physical damage (3), and death (4). The main outcome measures were total costs of patients and costs per patient (PP), with or without the presence of complications, cost of complications and costs per complication (PC), and the costs of their consequences calculated in euros (euro).\nNinety patients (mean age, 71.4 years; 59% men) were included. Group B patients had a significantly higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (4) and Fontaine (3) classification and more secondary procedures.

    "abstract": "The success of open and endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is hampered by postoperative dilatation of the anatomical neck of the AAA, which is used for graft attachment. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the macroscopically non-diseased infrarenal aortic neck of AAA is histologically and biochemically altered at the time of operative repair.\nWe harvested full-thickness aortic wall samples as longitudinal stripes spanning from AAA neck to aneurysmal sac in 22 consecutive patients undergoing open surgical AAA repair. Control tissue was obtained from five organ donors and five deceased subjects undergoing autopsy without evidence of aneurysmal disease. We assessed aortic media thickness, number of intact elastic lamellar units, media destruction, and neovascularization grade and performed immunohistochemistry for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK). MMP-9 and p-JNK protein expressions were quantified using Western Blots.\nThe median thickness of the aortic media was 1150 mum in control tissue (range, 1000-1300), 510 mum in aortic necks (250-900), and 200 mum in aortic sacs (50-500, P from nonparametric test for trend <.001). The number of intact elastic lamellar units was 33 in controls (range, 33-55), 12 in aortic necks (0-31) and three in aortic sacs (0-10, P < .001). The expression of MMP-9 and p-JNK as assessed by Western Blots (P = .007 and .061, respectively) and zymography (P for trend <.001) were up regulated in both the AAA neck and sac compared with controls. Except for p-JNK expression, differences between tissues were similar after the adjustment for age, gender, and type of sampling.\nThe seemingly non-diseased infrarenal AAA neck in patients with AAA undergoing surgical repair shows histological signs of destruction and upregulation of potential drug targets.",

    "abstract": "The use of intravascular stents in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) continues to be controversial due to the potential for compression and fracture in the tortuous physical environment of the adductor canal. The purpose of this study was to (1) characterize the types and ranges of stent distortion theoretically produced by extremity movement and (2) use these ranges as parameters for in vitro long-term fatigue testing of commercially available self-expanding nitinol stents.\nNitinol self-expanding stents were placed in the SFAs of cadavers and lateral view radiographs were obtained with the limb in various degrees of hip and knee flexion. The measured degrees of axial shortening and bending of the stent were estimated by planimetry and used for in vitro fatigue testing, which was undertaken using specially designed equipment. Six different commercially available nitinol self-expanding stents-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 EverFlex (EV3, Minneapolis, Minn), S.M.A.R.T. Control (Cordis/Johnson & Johnson, Miami Lakes, Fla), Luminexx (C.R. Bard, Murray Hill, NJ), LifeStent FlexStar (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, Calif), and Xceed and Absolute (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, Calif)-were mounted in elastic silicone tubing, bathed in phosphate buffered saline at 37 degrees +/- 2 degrees C, and examined for fracture after 10 million cycles of chronic deformation.\nFor unstented arteries, the distal SFA/proximal popliteal artery exhibited the greatest axial compression (23%) vs the middle SFA (9%) or popliteal artery (14%) at 90 degrees /90 degrees knee/hip flexion. For stented arteries, the popliteal artery exhibited the most axial compression (11%) vs the middle SFA (3%) or distal SFA/proximal popliteal artery (6%) at 90 degrees /90 degrees knee/hip flexion. Axial compression of the stented popliteal artery at 70 degrees /20 degrees knee/hip flexion was 6% with a deflection angle of 33 degrees . These parameters were used for chronic in vitro fatigue testing, which produced a range of responses in commercially available stents. Chronic 5% axial compression resulted in high rates of fracture of Luminexx (80%) and LifeStent FlexStar (50%), with lower fracture rates for Absolute (3%), Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 EverFlex (0%), and S.M.A.R.T.

Increased arginase activity may modulate intracellular L-arginine levels, the substrate for nitric oxide. The purpose of this study was to identify the role of arginase in endothelial dysfunction in cell culture and in the vasomotor response of arteries exposed to thrombus.\nRat aortic endothelial cells were exposed to thrombin at different time points. The cell extract was analyzed by immunoblotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Adult male rats underwent infrarenal aortic thrombosis by clip ligature for 1 hour. Infrarenal aortic ring segments were harvested and placed in physiologic buffer baths, and a force transducer was used to measure endothelial-dependent relaxation (EDR) and endothelial-independent relaxation (EIR). Arginase blockade was performed by incubating infrarenal aortic ring segments with arginase inhibitors for 1 hour before measuring EDR. Whole tissue extracts also underwent immunoblot analysis. The EDR and EIR curves were compared with analyses of variance.\nA 6.76 +/- 1.4-fold induction in arginase I message levels (P = .001) was found in rat aortic endothelial cells exposed to thrombin (30 U/mL), and arginase I protein levels increased 2.1 times. The eight infrarenal aortic ring segments exposed to thrombosis for 1 hour had diminished EDR curves compared with 14 nonthrombosed normal segments (controls). The maximum (+/- SEM) EDR (acetylcholine 10(-5)M dose) in control infrarenal aortic ring segments was 108% +/- 4.3% compared with 63% +/- 6.2% for thrombosed infrarenal aortic ring segments (P < .001). Exposure to arterial thrombosis resulted in a 3.8-times increase in arginase I protein levels in infrarenal aortic ring segments. Preincubation of nine infrarenal aortic ring segments with the nonspecific (difluoromethylornithine) and six with specific ([S]-[2-boronoethyl]-L-Cysteine-HCl [BEC]) arginase inhibitor for 1 hour significantly increased the maximum EDR compared with untreated thrombosed segments (104 +/- 5.2, 108 +/- 7.6 vs 63% +/- 6.2, P < .001). EDR curves for difluoromethylornithine- and BEC-treated infrarenal aortic ring segments were superimposed on control EDR curves. The EIR and the vasoconstriction with norepinephrine for all groups were similar.\nEndothelial cells exposed to thrombin have increased arginase I messenger RNA and protein levels.

    "abstract": "The mortality rate for renal artery bypass grafting (RABG) is reported to be 0% to 4% for patients with renovascular hypertension and 4% to 7% for patients with ischemic nephropathy. However, these data come from high-volume referral centers known for their expertise in treating these conditions. Because of the relative infrequency of these operations in most vascular surgery practices, the nationwide outcomes for RABG are not known. The purpose of this study was to define the operative mortality rate for RABG in the United States and to identify risk factors for perioperative mortality.\nThe National Inpatient Sample was analyzed to identify patients undergoing RABG for the years 2000 to 2004. Categoric data were analyzed using chi(2) and the Cochran-Armitage trend tests. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for perioperative mortality after RABG.\nDuring the study period, 6608 patients underwent RABG, representing a frequency of 3.51 operations per 100,000 discharges. More than two-thirds were performed at teaching hospitals (4564 vs 2,044; P < .0001). The frequency of RABG decreased by 30.7% between 2000 and 2004 (4.28 vs 2.96 RABGs per 100,000 discharges; P for trend < .0001). The in-hospital mortality for RABG was 10.0%. On univariate analysis, in-hospital mortality after RABG varied with increasing age, race, region of the country, and a preoperative history of chronic renal failure, congestive heart failure, or chronic lung disease. Logistic regression models identified advanced age (odds ratio [OR] 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-1.72], female gender (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02-1.41), and a history of chronic renal failure (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.75-2.78), congestive heart failure (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.44-2.62), or chronic lung disease (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.18-1.67) as independent markers of risk-adjusted, in-hospital mortality (P < .0001 for each of these five variables).\nNationwide in-hospital mortality after RABG is higher than predicted by prior reports from high-volume referral centers. Advanced age, female gender, and a history of chronic renal failure, congestive heart failure, or chronic lung disease were predictive of perioperative death. For the typical vascular practice, these data may provide a rationale for lower risk alternatives, such as renal artery stenting or referral to high-volume referral centers for RABG.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery lesions from symptomatic patients are characterized by inflammation and neovascularization. The adipokine leptin promotes angiogenesis and activates inflammatory cells, and the leptin receptor (ob gene-encoded receptor), ObR, is expressed in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. The present study quantitatively analyzed ObR messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and immunoreactivity in carotid artery plaques from symptomatic and asymptomatic persons. Plaque angiogenesis, gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and macrophage density were also analyzed.\nCarotid endarterectomy specimens were collected from 26 patients undergoing surgery for hemispheric cerebrovascular symptoms (n = 13) or progressive asymptomatic internal carotid stenosis (n = 13). A representative sample, including part of the most active site, was collected from each lesion and evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis for ObR(long) and ObR(common) isoforms, VEGF(165), and macrophage adhesion molecule-1 (Mac-1) mRNA, and by immunohistochemistry for ObR, von Willebrand factor (vWF), and CD68 antigen expression.\nAll plaques exhibited advanced atherosclerosis (American Heart Association class IV through VI). Transcript levels were preferentially elevated in symptomatic plaques for ObR(long) (P = .0006) and ObR(common) (P = .033), with a simultaneous upregulation of VEGF(165) (P = .001) and Mac-1 mRNA expression (P = .003). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed a significant increase of ObR antigen levels (P = .011) and CD68-positive inflammatory cells (P = .049) in symptomatic plaques, whereas neovascularization, evident in all plaques, was similar in both groups (P = .7).\nThe ObR(long) and ObR(common) genes are upregulated and their protein preferentially synthesized in clinically symptomatic carotid plaques. Moreover, ObR expression is positively correlated with augmentation of gene transcripts related to macrophage density and neovascularization. These data suggest that ObR(long) and ObR(common) may be linked with histologic features of carotid plaque instability, which are associated with cerebral ischemic symptoms.",

    "abstract": "This prospective, non-randomized study evaluated the short- and mid-term feasibility, safety, primary patency, and limb salvage of cutting balloon percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (CB-PTA) for the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD).\nAll data were collected for 128 consecutive patients who underwent CB-PTA to improve infrainguinal arterial circulation between January 2003 and July 2007. One-hundred thirty-five limbs with PAOD (claudication, n = 19; critical limb ischemia [CLI], n = 116) were treated. Patency was evaluated by clinical examination and duplex ultrasonography. A total of 203 lesions (183 stenoses, 20 occlusions) were treated in 66 femoropopliteal and 69 infrapopliteal arterial segments. The TransAtlantic Inter-Societal Consensus (TASC) classification of the primary lesions was A in 41.5%, B in 45.2%, C in 8.2%, and D 5.1%. Mean follow-up was 16.1 +/- 9.7 months. The overall technical success rate was 96.3% and the complication rate was 8.9%. There were two (1.5%) perioperative deaths. The primary patency rate was 82.1% at 12- and 24-months in patients with claudication (femoropopliteal lesions). The 1- and 2-year results for femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal lesions in patients with CLI were: primary patency 64.4% and 51.9 %, respectively; limb salvage 84.2% and 76.9%; survival 92.6% and 88.5%. More distal lesions and TASC classification were significant independent risk factors for outcome (P < .05). Treatment of multiple segment lesions was an independent predictor of a favorable outcome (P = .04).\nCB-PTA is safe and feasible for the treatment of infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease, with relatively low mid-term restenosis rates compared to other endovascular treatments. However, these data cannot be extrapolated to potential outcomes for lesions >10 cm in length. Further follow-up will be necessary to evaluate the long-term results of CB-PTA.",

    "abstract": "To validate a method for determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in the seated position.\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a prevalent disorder that is associated with quality of life impairment and increased risk of a major cardiovascular event. The ABI is the initial test for screening and diagnosis of PAD. To prevent error due hydrostatic pressure, accurate measurement of the ABI requires supine patient positioning. Access to ABI measurement is limited for patients who are immobilized or unable to lie flat.\nPatients presenting to a vascular laboratory for suspected arterial disease were enrolled. Arm and ankle blood pressures were measured in the supine and seated positions. Seated ankle pressures were corrected by the following physiology-based formula: Corrected ankle pressure = Measured ankle pressure - D*(.078), where D = the vertical distance between the arm and ankle cuffs (mm). This formula equates to a correction factor of 78 mm Hg per meter distance between the arm and ankle cuffs. Corrected ankle pressure measurements were used for seated ABI calculation.\nComplete data were available for 100 patients. Mean ABI was 0.97, and 31% of patients had an ABI < or =0.9. There was excellent correlation between supine and corrected seated ankle pressure measurements (r = 0.884-0.936, P < .001). The difference between measurements was negligible (<5 mm Hg). Similarly, there was excellent correlation between supine and seated ABI measures (r = 0.936, P < .001). There was no significant difference between the supine and seated ABI measures.\nWe have developed and validated a method for determination of the ABI in the seated position which can be used to broaden availability of PAD testing. This method could also be incorporated into new technologies for ABI determination in the seated position.",

    "abstract": "Aortobifemoral bypass (ABF) grafting has been the traditional treatment for extensive aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD). This retrospective study compared the outcomes and durability of recanalization, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, and stenting (R/PTAS) vs ABF for severe AIOD.\nBetween 1998 and 2004, 86 patients (161 limbs) underwent ABF (n = 75) or iliofemoral bypass (n = 11), and 83 patients (127 limbs) underwent R/PTAS. All patients had severe symptomatic AIOD (claudication, 53%; rest pain, 28%; tissue loss, 12%; acute limb ischemia, 7%). The analyses excluded patients treated for aneurysms, extra-anatomic procedures, and endovascular treatment of iliac stenoses. Original angiographic imaging, medical records, and noninvasive testing were reviewed. Kaplan-Meier estimates for patency and survival were calculated and univariate analyses performed. Mortality was verified by the Social Security database.\nThe ABF patients were younger than the R/PTAS patients (60 vs 65 years; P = .003) and had higher rates of hyperlipidemia (P = .009) and smoking (P < .001). All other clinical variables, including cardiac status, diabetes, symptoms at presentation, TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus stratification, and presence of poor outflow were similar between the two groups. Patients underwent ABF with general anesthesia (96%), often with concomitant treatment of femoral or infrainguinal disease (61% endarterectomy, profundaplasty, or distal bypass). Technical success was universal, with marked improvement in ankle-brachial indices (0.48 to 0.84, P < .001). Patients underwent R/PTAS with local anesthesia/sedation (78%), with a 96% technical success rate and similar hemodynamic improvement (0.36 to 0.82, P < .001). At the time of R/PTAS, 21% of patients underwent femoral endarterectomy/profundaplasty or bypass (n = 5) for concomitant infrainguinal disease. Limb-based primary patency at 3 years was significantly higher for ABF than for R/PTAS (93% vs 74%, P = .002). Secondary patency rates (97% vs 95%), limb salvage (98% vs. 98%), and long-term survival (80% vs 80%) were similar. Diabetes mellitus and the requirement of distal bypass were associated with decreased patency (P < .001). Critical limb ischemia at presentation (tissue loss, hazard ratio [HR], 8.1; P < .001), poor outflow (HR, 2; P = .023), and renal failure (HR, 2.5; P = .02) were associated with decreased survival.\nR/PTAS is a suitable, less invasive alternative to ABF for the treatment of severe AIOD. Repair of the concomitant femoral occlusive disease is often needed regardless of open or endovascular treatment. Infrainguinal disease negatively affects the durability of the procedure and patient survival.",

    "abstract": "Early thrombus removal in patients with iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (IFDVT) reduces postthrombotic morbidity. Preserving valve function and relieving venous obstruction prevents deterioration of quality of life and loss of economic potential. The preferred method for treating IFDVT is catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT). Recently, isolated segmental pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (ISPMT) has emerged as a treatment option for patients with extensive IFDVT. The purpose of our study is to determine whether there are advantages to using ISPMT as the primary treatment for patients with iliofemoral IFDVT and, if so, to quantify those advantages relative to CDT.\nForty-three patients with IFDVT were treated with percutaneous CDT between May 2003 and June 2007. Twenty-one patients (27 limbs) were treated with CDT and 22 patients (25 limbs) were treated with ISPMT +/- CDT. Demographics, extent of thrombus, procedural details, and thrombus resolution were recorded.\nTreatment time (55.4 vs 23.4 hours; P < .0001) and dose of rt-PA (59.3 vs 33.4 mg; P = .0009) were decreased and overall lytic success (60% vs 80%; P = .0016) increased with ISPMT. Adjunctive venoplasty and stenting, complications, hospital length-of-stay (LOS), and intensive care unit LOS were similar between groups.\nISPMT offers more effective thrombus removal in less time and with a reduced dose of thrombolytic agent. However, decreased treatment time did not translate into decreased hospital or ICU stay. Longer-term follow-up is required to determine whether improved thrombus resolution translates to better functional outcome and reduced postthrombotic morbidity.",

    "abstract": "The neoaortoiliac system (NAIS) has gained popularity as a durable procedure for treating aortic graft infections. However, one of the disadvantages has been a long operation that can take up to 10 hours. The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of staging the NAIS procedure with deep vein harvest a day before the aortofemoral bypass and evaluate if staging had any effect on graft patency or morbidity and mortality, or both.\nWe reviewed data for all the NAIS procedures performed for aortic graft infections at a tertiary care university hospital. The femoral popliteal veins of patients undergoing the staged NAIS were harvested a day in advance and left in situ. The next day patients underwent the prosthetic graft excision with reconstruction using the femoral popliteal veins. Patients with aortic occlusion on presentation were not candidates for vein harvest in advance and underwent a unilateral bypass with a subsequent femorofemoral bypass as a second stage.\nIn the last 8 years, 26 patients (17 men, 9 women; mean age, 62.6 +/- 8.3 years) underwent the NAIS procedure for aortic graft infections. Mean follow-up was 15.7 months. Primary assisted graft patency was 100%. There were 11 patients in the staged group and 10 patients in the nonstaged group. All the staged patients underwent vein mobilization a day before excision of aortic prosthesis. Despite undergoing a separate procedure for vein harvesting at a different time, there was no difference in total operative time (12.0 +/- 1.8 vs 11.9 +/- 2.2 hours), operative blood loss (2.6 +/- 1.2 vs 3.4 +/- 2.4 L), and requirements for transfusion for blood products (6.7 +/- 3.7 vs 6.0 +/- 5.4 U) or crystalloid (11.3 +/- 3.1 vs 10.9 +/- 2.4 L) between the staged group and nonstaged groups. One amputation occurred in each group. The perioperative mortality was 18% for the staged group and 20% for nonstaged group. The 12-month survival was 72% for staged and 70% for nonstaged NAIS. No graft-related complications were observed from the preoperative vein harvest.\nThe NAIS can be staged without compromising the efficacy of the procedure as evident by excellent long-term patency and control of the infection. By reducing the duration of the primary procedure, staging may be beneficial to both the patient and the surgeon.",

    "abstract": "Renal artery aneurysms are being discovered more frequently due to increased use of non-invasive imaging. Complex renal artery aneurysms involving multiple secondary or tertiary branches are not amenable to in vivo or endovascular treatment and often require ex vivo repair with autotransplantation. In order to minimize incisional morbidity and hasten recovery, we developed a technique of laparoscopic nephrectomy combined with backbench ex vivo repair, followed by autotransplantation through a small laparoscopic extraction incision. This study describes our initial experience with this combined technique in patients that were not candidates for endovascular techniques or in vivo arterial reconstruction.\nSeven patients with complex renal artery aneurysms underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy and ex vivo repair with multiple saphenous vein grafts and autotransplantation through the small laparoscopic extraction incision. The aneurysms ranged from 2.5 to 5.0 cm. In all cases, the aneurysm was resected ex vivo, leaving multiple branch arteries that were extended with saphenous vein grafts. Arterial inflow was then re-established with sequential saphenous vein anastomoses to the external iliac artery. Ureteral reconstruction was performed via standard Lich ureteroneocystostomy. Patients were followed postoperatively for two to eight years.\nLaparoscopic nephrectomy with ex vivo repair of complex aneurysms was successfully employed in seven patients with renal aneurysms that were not amenable to endovascular or in vivo repair. There were no incisional morbidities and all patients had significant improvements in symptoms post-operatively. Renal function remained unchanged and there were no ureteral complications following surgery. All patients had postoperative ultrasound imaging done at two years which demonstrated patency of the anastomoses. The mean hospital stay was four days (range, two to seven days).\nRepair of complex renal artery aneurysms involving distal branch arteries remains a challenge. This new technique combines the advantages of minimally invasive surgery with the effectiveness of ex vivo aneurysm repair.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair of injured thoracic aorta offers a new minimal invasive therapeutic option that could be beneficial in the urgent management of polytrauma patients. The aim of this study was to assess our multicenter experience of immediate endovascular repair for acute traumatic injuries of the thoracic aorta.\nBetween April 2002 and October 2007, all patients treated for an acute traumatic injury of the thoracic aorta, in a less than 12-hour delay, by endovascular repair, were reviewed retrospectively in three Parisian trauma centers. Collected data included age, sex, associated comorbidities, and traumatic lesions to determine the Traumatic Injury Severity Score (TRISS), the type of aortic lesion assessed by computed tomography (CT)-scan and transesophageal ultrasonography, technical aspects of endovascular repair, length of hospital stay, and postoperative mortality. Patients were regularly followed by clinical examination, chest radiographs, and thoracic CT-scan.\nTwenty-eight patients (20 males, mean age 45 +/- 18.8 years) were treated in a median delay of 5 hours (range 2 to 10 hours) after initial trauma. They all experienced severe traumatic injuries with a mean predictive mortality of 55.6% +/- 33.1% according to TRISS. Aortic lesions were associated with aortic parietal hematoma (71%), hemomediastinum (86%), and hemothorax (68%). All endovascular procedures were technically successful through femoral (n = 24) or iliac access (n = 4), in a mean operating time of 94 +/- 35.8 minutes. Proximal sealing of the endografts required the coverage of the origin of the left subclavian artery in 13 cases and of the left common carotid in one case. The median of hospital stay was 27 days (range 9 to 127 days), with an overall hospital mortality of 17.9% (n = 5). All deaths were unrelated to the aortic rupture or the stent placement, and no intervention-related morbidity or mortality was recorded during a median follow-up of 24 months (range 5 to 73 months).\nEndovascular stent grafting allows an immediate efficient repair for acute traumatic injuries of the thoracic aorta. This early management is, however, associated with a high in-hospital mortality, related to the severe concomitant injuries of such unselected multitrauma patients.",

    "abstract": "Subintimal angioplasty (SIA) is being increasingly utilized to treat chronic arterial occlusions. The role of stents in SIA is currently unknown. We performed a retrospective review of selective stent use in SIA to assess outcomes and factors affecting these results.\nA retrospective review of patient information--including demographics, indications, procedures, noninvasive studies, and post-procedural events--was performed on our database for patients undergoing SIA in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. Outcomes were calculated only on technically successful SIAs using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Continuous and non-continuous data were compared using the Student t test and the z test, respectively. Survival curves were compared using log-rank testing for univariate analysis and Cox hazard-regression analysis for multivariate analysis.\nThree-hundred-sixty-eight patients (382 limbs) underwent femoral and/or popliteal SIA for critical limb ischemia or disabling claudication from December 1, 2002 through July 31, 2006. Eighty-four limbs (22%) had a stent placed, while 298 (78%) did not receive a stent. Mean follow-up was 11.7 months (range, 0-45 months). One-year primary and secondary patency for stent vs no-stent group was 50% vs 45% (P = .73) and 70% vs 78% (P = .47), respectively. One-year limb salvage rate for the stent vs no-stent group was 85% vs 90% (P = .61). At 2 years, patients receiving a stent are more likely to undergo open bypass than those without a stent (P = .06). Eighty-three patients underwent 84 SIA with stent placement. The mean number of stents for each case was 1.4 +/- 0.7. Univariate analysis revealed that previous ipsilateral bypass surgery significantly decreased 1-year patency: 35% vs 56% (P = .05). SIA performed for disabling claudication had a trend toward improved 1-year patency 58% vs 39% for critical limb ischemia (P = .09). A stent diameter > or =7 mm displayed a trend toward better patency 53% vs 37% for diameter < or =6 mm (P = .08). None of these factors proved significant with multivariate analysis.\nSelective stents placed for suboptimal results after subintimal angioplasty produce similar patency rates to primary SIA without stents. Patients receiving stents with prior lower extremity bypass surgery will have worse outcomes than those without. Use of a stent diameter < or =6 mm and indication of critical limb ischemia will likely produce worse results. It appears that other stent variables (location, number, length, and overlap) do not alter patency. Finally, selective stent use after SIA provides excellent limb salvage.",

    "abstract": "The concept of repeatedly connecting an extracorporeal blood pump to produce pancycle suprasystolic inflow pressures to ischemic limbs is introduced. Balloon catheters allow for limb isolation from the systemic circulation. In the acute phase, it is assumed that pressure is proportion to flow (Poiseuille's Law) and in the chronic phase that collateral growth is related to endothelial shear stress and wall tension. The primary objective was to establish that increased flow could be achieved through collateral circulation in animals and in man with extracorporeal limb hyperperfusion. The second objective was to develop and test an arterial access system capable of intermittent regional hyperperfusion similar in concept to intermittent hemodialysis. Finally, to demonstrate the translocation of these concepts into humans facing major limb amputation where all standard treatment options had been exhausted.\nTwelve sheep (6 hyperperfusion and 6 controls) were attached to a cardiac vortex pump and perfused at 200 mm Hg pancycle with the superficial femoral artery doubly ligated and isolated from the systemic circulation with a balloon catheter. Pressure transducers measured carotid and distal femoral pressures and the carotid-femoral index was calculated. To allow hyperperfusion to be repeated transcutaneously, a peripheral access system (PAS [Allvascular, St Leonards, New South Wales, Australia]) was constructed. This device was implanted in the common carotid artery in 8 sheep and opened approximately 3 days a week for continuous arterial access up to 37 days for 67 openings. To demonstrate these principles in humans, 3 patients with critically ischemic limbs were hyperperfused intermittently. Digital thermography compared the other limb as controls and provided objective evidence of the vascular changes.\nThe mean carotid-femoral index was 0.6 +/- 0.01 for controls compared with 1.1 +/- 0.28 for the hyperperfusion group (P < .001). The collateral flow was superior to normal flow (ie, with the superficial femoral not occluded). Continuous access to the carotid arterial tree via the access device was 25.3 +/- 8.8 days with 5 of 8 devices open for the entire observational period (maximum 37 days). The human ischemic limbs were hyperperfused at 2-4 times the mean arterial pressure producing 3-6 times an increase in pump flow measurements intermittently for 53 +/- 16 hours. The clinical findings of rest pain, paresthesia, capillary return, and movement showed dramatic improvement as did thermographic emissions. Major amputation was avoided in the cases presented.\nBlood flow through collaterals can be very significantly augmented by connection to an extracorporeal pump with isolation from the systemic circulation. The pancycle hyperperfusion can be safely repeated by implantation of an arterial access device. In the longer term, there is evidence of collateral development. When amputation is the only alternative, hypertensive extracorporeal limb perfusion should be considered.",

Continuous access to the carotid arterial tree via the access device was 25.3 +/- 8.8 days with 5 of 8 devices open for the entire observational period (maximum 37 days). The human ischemic limbs were hyperperfused at 2-4 times the mean arterial pressure producing 3-6 times an increase in pump flow measurements intermittently for 53 +/- 16 hours. The clinical findings of rest pain, paresthesia, capillary return, and movement showed dramatic improvement as did thermographic emissions. Major amputation was avoided in the cases presented.",

    "abstract": "It is not uncommon for all usual upper limb autogenous access sites to fail, often in patients for whom neither peritoneal dialysis nor transplantation is an appropriate option. Axillary-axillary arteriovenous bypass grafts could be used as the last option before a thigh autogenous access even in case of unilateral central venous stenosis or obstruction. We describe our experience with this procedure in a series of patients.\nA consecutive series of 18 patients for whom all possible arm accesses had failed and neither peritoneal dialysis nor transplantation was possible underwent a necklace graft formation over a 2.5-year period. All grafts implanted were 6 mm, internally reinforced prostheses made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Gore-Tex Intering Vascular Graft, W. L. Gore and Associates, Inc, Flagstaff, Ariz) anastomosed end to side the axillary artery and contralateral vein, and tunneled straight in the subcutaneous space before the sternum. All patients had bimonthly clinical examinations in which the thrill, bruit, skin, cannulation sites, and dialysis adequacy were reviewed. They also had at the same time a transonic assessment where graft flows and recirculation rates were measured. In case of low flow (<600 mL/min) or drop of 20% between two measurements or recirculation >5% a fistulogram was obtained, and an intervention was performed to restore patency.\nWe operated on 10 males and 8 females; mean age was 55.1 years. The primary patency was 83% and 72.2%, and the secondary patency was 94.4% and 88.9% at 6 months and 1 year, respectively. Five successful surgical revisions were carried out for four clotted grafts and one post dialysis rupture. One surgical revision for thrombosis failed and one local infection lead to thrombosis and was not amenable to surgical revision. Three patients died of causes unrelated to their vascular access during the study period.\nThe reasonable patency and minimal complications associated with these bypasses show that they are a valid option for complex patients. We advocate the use of this bypass in patients with exhaustion of all access possibilities in both arms with a patent superior vena cava, subclavian, and brachiocephalic veins. We also indicate it in case of unilateral central venous stenosis or obstruction with complete exhaustion of all other access possibilities on the contralateral side.",

    "abstract": "Aortoiliac occlusive disease may preclude retrograde thoracic endovascular aortic repair. This study evaluated the physiologic and anatomic feasibility of introducing an aortic endograft in an antegrade manner into the descending thoracic aorta of a pig through the left ventricular apex.\nTwelve adult pigs were to undergo antegrade endograft deployment. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a stiff guidewire was introduced past the aortic valve and into the distal abdominal aorta through the left ventricular apex on a beating heart. An 18F introducer sheath containing a 24 x 36-mm aortic endograft was introduced and deployed in the descending thoracic aorta. The accuracy of graft delivery was determined at necropsy by measuring the distance from the trailing edge of the graft to the downstream margin of the ostium of the left subclavian artery. Aortic valve competency was assessed angiographically and at necropsy. Left ventricular function was assessed angiographically. Five hemodynamic and respiratory variables were recorded at 12 stages during the procedure and assessed for significant changes from baseline.\nOne animal died during the sternotomy. All remaining pigs survived the experiment with minimal hemodynamic support. A significant drop in systolic blood pressure (75 +/- 2 to 60 +/- 4 mm Hg, P = .05) was noted when the aortic valve was crossed with an 18F sheath. The systolic blood pressure returned to baseline on endograft deployment and at the end of the procedure. Bradycardia was noted at several stages of the procedure, requiring treatment in two pigs. Eleven endografts were deployed; seven grafts were delivered within 5 mm and three grafts within 10 to 20 mm of the intended landing point. One graft was deployed 10 mm too proximally, covering the left subclavian artery. No aortic valvular insufficiency or left ventricular dysfunction was noted.\nAn aortic endograft can be delivered in an antegrade manner transapically into the descending thoracic aorta in a pig model with a reasonable degree of accuracy and minimal hemodynamic compromise.",

Patients with acute mesenteric ischemia or median arcuate ligament syndrome were excluded. Mortality, recurrent stenosis, and symptomatic recurrence were analyzed using logistic regression, and univariate and multivariate analysis.\nWe identified 80 patients (69% women, 31% men). Mean age was 64 years (range, 31-86 years). Acute-on-chronic symptoms were present in 26%. Presenting symptoms included postprandial pain (91%), weight loss (69%), and food fear and diarrhea (25%). Preoperative imaging demonstrated severe (>70%) stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery in 75 patients (24 occluded), the celiac axis in 63 (20 occluded), and the inferior mesenteric artery in 53 (20 occluded). Multivessel disease was present in 72 patients (90%), and 40 (50%) underwent multivessel reconstruction. Revascularization was achieved by endarterectomy in 37 patients, mesenteric bypass in 29, and combined procedures in 14. Concurrent aortic reconstruction was required in 13 patients (16%). Three hospital deaths occurred (3.8%). Mean follow-up was 3.8 years (range, 0-17.2 years). One- and 5-year survival was 92.2% and 64.5%.

Multivariate analysis showed that freedom from recurrent symptoms correlated with endarterectomy for revascularization (5.2% vs 27.6%; hazard ratio, 0.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.92; P = .02).\nFor open surgical candidates, endarterectomy appears to provide the most durable long-term symptom relief in patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia.",

The model allowed the study of hemodynamics of simulated arteriovenous fistulas, including collateral circulation, as well as the study of different simulated procedures to improve distal hypoperfusion. Flow rates and arterial pressure were measured simultaneously during simulation of corrective procedures and correlated to hemodynamic values of uncorrected ischemia.\nIt was demonstrated that the more proximally localized an arteriovenous anastomosis is, the higher the distal arterial pressure will be at any given fistula flow. Reduction of the fistula flow resulted in a significant improvement of distal perfusion. Ligation of the artery distal to the arteriovenous fistula to prevent retrograde flow increased the distal perfusion only slightly in simulated ischemia. In contrast, the simulated corrective procedures of distal revascularization interval ligation and proximalization of arterial inflow resulted in a significant improvement. The most significant improvement of distal perfusion was observed with the simulated proximalization technique, whereas the effect of distal revascularization technique was less pronounced at higher fistula flow. Arterial ligation after distal revascularization increased the distal pressure only by 10%.\nA more centrally localized arteriovenous anastomosis and a reduction of fistula flow significantly increase distal perfusion. The procedure of proximalization of arterial inflow is at least equivalent to the distal revascularization interval ligation technique for the correction of distal ischemia, but does not sacrifice a patent axial artery. The moderate effect of interval ligation of the latter technique should be evaluated by further intraoperative measurements.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with systemic impaired flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and increased risk for cardiovascular events. Decreased FMD may be caused by a decrease in arterial shear stress due to claudication and inflammation due to muscle ischemia and reperfusion. We assumed that endovascular revascularization of lower limb arterial obstructions ameliorates FMD and lowers inflammation through improvement of peripheral perfusion.\nThe study was a prospective, open, randomized, controlled, single-center follow-up evaluation assessing the effect of endovascular revascularization on brachial artery reactivity (FMD) measured by ultrasound, white blood cell (WBC) count, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and fibrinogen. We investigated 33 patients (23 men) with chronic and stable PAD (Rutherford 2 to 3) due to femoropopliteal obstruction. Variables were assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks in 17 patients (group A) who underwent endovascular revascularization and best medical treatment, and in 16 patients (group B) who received best medical treatment only.\nFMD did not differ between group A and B (4.96% +/- 1.86% vs 4.60% +/- 2.95%; P = .87) at baseline. It significantly improved after revascularization in group A (6.44% +/- 2.88%; P = .02) compared with group B at 4 weeks of follow-up (4.53% +/- 3.17%; P = .92), where it remained unchanged. The baseline ankle-brachial index (ABI) was similar for group A and B (0.63 +/- 0.15 vs 0.66 +/- 0.10; P = .36). At 4 weeks of follow-up, ABI was significantly increased in group A (1.05 +/- 0.15; P = .0004) but remained unchanged in group B (0.62 +/- 0.1). WBC counts of the two groups were comparable at baseline (group A: 7.6 +/- 2.26 x 10(6)/mL and group B: 7.8 +/- 2.02 x 10(6)/mL, P = .81). In group A, the leukocyte count significantly decreased after angioplasty from 7.6 +/- 2.26 to 6.89 +/- 1.35 x 10(6)/mL (P = .03). For group B, WBC count did not differ significantly compared with baseline (7.76 +/- 2.64 x 10(6)/mL; P = .94). No effects were observed on hs-CRP or fibrinogen from endovascular therapy.\nEndovascular revascularization with reestablishment of peripheral arterial perfusion improves FMD and reduces WBC count in patients with claudication. Revascularization may therefore have clinical implications beyond relief of symptoms, for example, reducing oxidative stress caused by repeated muscle ischemia or increased shear stress due to improved ambulatory activity.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are at risk of rupture when the internal load (blood pressure) exceeds the aneurysm wall strength. Generally, the maximal diameter of the aneurysm is used as a predictor of rupture; however, biomechanical properties may be a better predictor than the maximal diameter. Compliance and distensibility are two biomechanical properties that can be determined from the pressure-volume relationship of the aneurysm. This study determined the compliance and distensibility of the AAA by simultaneous instantaneous pressure and volume measurements; as a secondary goal, the influence of direct and indirect pressure measurements was compared.\nTen men (aged 73.6 +/- 6.4 years) with an infrarenal AAA were studied. Three-dimensional balanced turbo field echo (3D B-TFE) images were acquired with noncontrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the aortic region proximal to the renal arteries until just beyond the bifurcation. Volume changes were extracted from the electrocardiogram-triggered 3D B-TFE MRI images using dedicated prototype software. Pressure was measured simultaneously within the AAA using a fluid-filled pigtail catheter. Noninvasive brachial cuff measurements were also acquired before and after the imaging sequence simultaneously with the invasive pressure measurement to investigate agreement between the techniques. Compliance was calculated as the slope of the best linear fit through the pressure volume data points. Distensibility was calculated by dividing the compliance by the diastolic aneurysmal volume. Young's moduli were estimated from the compliance data.\nThe AAA maximal diameter was 5.8 +/- 0.6 cm. A strong linear relation between the pressure and volume data was found. Distensibility was 1.8 +/- 0.7 x 10(-3) kPa(-1). Average compliance was 0.31 +/- 0.15 mL/kPa with accompanying estimates for Young's moduli of 9.0 +/- 2.5 MPa. Brachial cuff measurements demonstrated an underestimation of 5% for systolic (P < .001) and an overestimation of 12% for diastolic blood pressure (P < .001) compared with the pressure measured within the aneurysm.\nDistensibility and compliance of the wall of the aneurysm were determined in humans by simultaneous intra-aneurysmal pressure and volume measurements. A strong linear relationship existed between the intra-aneurysmal pressure and the volume change of the AAA. Brachial cuff measurements were significantly different compared with invasive intra-aneurysmal measurements. Consequently, no absolute distensibility values can be determined noninvasively. However, because of a constant and predictable difference between directly and indirectly derived blood pressures, MRI-based monitoring of aneurysmal distensibility may serve the online rupture risk during follow-up of aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "The importance of wound cytokine function in chronic venous leg ulcers remains poorly understood. This study evaluated the relationship between local and systemic concentrations of wound cytokines and wound healing in patients with chronic venous ulceration.\nThis prospective observational study was set in a community- and hospital-based leg ulcer clinic. Consecutive patients with chronic leg ulceration and ankle-brachial pressure index >0.85 were prospectively investigated. All patients were treated with multilayer compression bandaging. Wound fluid and venous blood samples were collected at recruitment and 5 weeks later. In the wound fluid and venous blood, cytokines and factors reflecting the processes of inflammation (interleukin 1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), proteolysis (matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9), angiogenesis (basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF], vascular endothelial growth factor), and fibrosis (transforming growth factor-beta(1) [TGFbeta(1)]) were measured. Ulcer healing was assessed using digital planimetry at both assessments.\nThe study comprised 80 patients (43 men, 37 women). Median (range) ulcer size reduced from 4.4 (0.1-142.4) cm(2) to 2.2 (0-135.5) cm(2) after 5 weeks (P < .001; Wilcoxon signed rank), although 17 of 80 ulcers increased in size. The volume of wound fluid collected strongly correlated with ulcer size (Spearman rank = 0.801, P < .01). Initial wound fluid concentrations of bFGF correlated with ulcer size (Pearson coefficient = 0.641, P < .01), and changes in wound fluid TGFbeta(1) concentrations inversely correlated with changes in ulcer size (Spearman rank = -0.645, P = .032). There were no significant correlations between changes in other factors and ulcer healing. Wound fluid and serum cytokine concentrations correlated poorly.\nWound fluid collection volume correlates with ulcer size. Ulcer healing correlated with increased concentrations of TGFbeta(1), possibly reflecting increased fibrogenesis in the proliferating wound. Aside from this, there was a large variation in wound and serum cytokine levels that largely limits their usefulness as markers of healing.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine signs of bleeding in the intraluminal thrombus and the site of rupture using multislice computed tomography (CT) imaging in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).\nWe analyzed CT images of 42 patients with ruptured infrarenal AAA in two hospitals in Stockholm, Sweden during a 3-year period. A \"crescent sign\" or localized areas with higher attenuation in the thrombus were interpreted as signs of bleeding in the thrombus. A localized area of hyperattenuation did not have the typical crescent shape and was distinguished from calcifications in the thrombus. We measured the attenuation in Hounsfield units in the intraluminal thrombus using CT software to quantify the presence of blood in the thrombus. As controls, we analyzed 36 patients with intact AAA and a comparable aneurysm diameter and age.\nThe crescent sign was more frequent in the ruptured group (38% vs 14%, P = .02), but there was no significant difference in the presence of localized areas of hyperattenuation in the two groups. The attenuation in the thrombus was significantly higher in patients with rupture than in those with intact aneurysms (P = .02). The site of rupture could be localized in 29/42 patients. Ruptures occurred both through the thrombus-covered and the thrombus free wall. In 45% of the patients, the rupture site was localized in the left lateral wall, in 24% in the anterior wall, in 24% in the right lateral wall, but only in 7% in the posterior wall.\nThe site of rupture could be identified in a majority of cases of AAA with routine multislice CT. This study demonstrates an association between the presence of blood in the thrombus as suggested by higher attenuation levels and a crescent sign and AAA rupture. If these findings also predict AAA rupture, remains to be established.",

The attenuation in the thrombus was significantly higher in patients with rupture than in those with intact aneurysms (P = .02). The site of rupture could be localized in 29/42 patients. Ruptures occurred both through the thrombus-covered and the thrombus free wall. In 45% of the patients, the rupture site was localized in the left lateral wall, in 24% in the anterior wall, in 24% in the right lateral wall, but only in 7% in the posterior wall.",

    "abstract": "Complications following percutaneous femoral access are a significant source of morbidity and cost in patients undergoing peripheral vascular interventions. Our purpose in this study is to determine if access complications could be reduced by the use of a standardized protocol.\nWe studied prospectively 210 consecutive patients in our vascular surgery practice undergoing peripheral arterial interventions via percutaneous retrograde femoral access. First, we prospectively collected data to determine current outcomes during a 4-month observation phase. Based on these experiences, we designed and implemented a uniform arterial closure protocol, with closure device use guided by sheath size, arterial calcification, and previous groin scarring. Our main outcome measures were major complications (need for operation) or minor complications (access site bleeding or hematoma). Outcomes were compared between the two phases using chi-squared analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA).\nIn the observation phase, 119 patients underwent 140 arterial punctures, and in the postprotocol phase, we performed 112 punctures in 91 patients. Between the observation and postprotocol phases, patient demographics were similar; average sheath size was unchanged (sheaths over 6F 6% vs 8%, respectively, P = .55), and percentage of patients receiving heparin did not change significantly (76% vs, 86%, P = .08). No major complications occurred in either the observation or the postprotocol phases. While 24 minor complications occurred in the observation phase, only seven minor complications occurred in the postprotocol phase (17% vs 7%, P < .02). Closure device use decreased with protocol implementation (57% to 32%, P < .01), but closure device failures also decreased from 23% to 7% (P < .01).\nProcess improvement, achieved by instituting a standardized percutaneous arterial closure protocol based on selective closure device use guided by sheath size, arterial calcification, and previous access scarring. Implementation of our protocol resulted in a decrease in the incidence of minor complications at the access site and refined patient selection for closure device use.",

    "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) simulation has been suggested to objectively assess endovascular skills. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of cognitive training on technical performance of inexperienced subjects on a commercially available VR simulator (VIST, Vascular Intervention Simulation Trainer, Mentice, Gothenburg, Sweden).\nForty-seven subjects treated an identical virtual iliac artery stenosis endovascularly. Surgical trainees without endovascular experience were allocated to two training protocols: group A(1) (n = 10) received a 45 minute didactic session followed by an expert demonstration of the procedure that included error-based learning, whereas group A(2) (n = 10) was only given a demonstration of an iliac dilation and stent procedure. All trainees performed the intervention immediately following the expert demonstration. Twenty-seven endovascular physicians were recruited (>100 endovascular interventions). Performance was assessed using the quantitative (procedure and fluoroscopy time) and qualitative (stent/vessel ratio and residual stenosis) assessment parameters recorded by the simulator.\nThe end-product (qualitative metrics) in the cognitive-skills group A(1) was similar to those of the endovascular physicians, though A(2) performed significantly worse than the physicians (group B): stent/vessel ratio (A(1) 0.89 vs B 0.96, P = .960; A(2) 0.66 vs B 0.96, P = .001) and residual stenosis (A(1) 11 vs B 4%, P = .511; A(2) 35 vs B 4%, P < .001). Group A(1) took longer to perform the procedure (A(1) 982 vs B 441 seconds, P < .001), with greater use of fluoroscopy than group B (A(1) 609 vs B 189 seconds, P < .001) whereas group A(2) performed the intervention as quickly as group B (A(2) 358 vs B 441 seconds, P = .192) but used less fluoroscopy (A(2) 120 vs 189 seconds, P = .002).\nCognitive-skills training significantly improves the quality of end-product on a VR endovascular simulator, and is fundamental prior to assessment of inexperienced subjects.",

Patients were assessed on their ambulatory activity patterns for 1 week with a small, lightweight step activity monitor attached to the ankle using elastic velcro straps above the lateral malleolus of the right leg. The step activity monitor recorded the number of strides taken on a minute-to-minute basis and the time spent ambulating. Patients also were characterized on ankle-brachial index (ABI), ischemic window (IW) after a treadmill test, as well as initial claudication distance (ICD), and absolute claudication distance (ACD) during treadmill exercise.\nThe patient characteristics (mean +/- SD) were as follows: ABI = 0.71 +/- 0.23, IW = 0.54 +/- 0.72 mm Hg.min.meter(-1), ICD = 236 +/- 198 meters, and ACD = 424 +/- 285 meters. The patients took 3366 +/- 1694 strides/day, and were active for 272 +/- 103 min/day. The cadence for the 30 highest, consecutive minutes of each day (15.1 +/- 7.2 strides/min) was correlated with ICD (r = 0.316, P < .001) and ACD (r = 0.471, P < 0.001), and the cadence for the 60 highest, consecutive minutes of each day (11.1 +/- 5.4 strides/min) was correlated with ICD (r = 0.290, P < .01) and ACD (r = 0.453, P < .001). Similarly, the cadences for the highest 1, 5, and 20 consecutive minutes, and the cadence for the 30 highest, nonconsecutive minutes all were correlated with ICD and ACD (P < .05). None of the ambulatory cadences were correlated with ABI (P > .05) or with ischemic window (P > .05).\nDaily ambulatory cadences are associated with severity of intermittent claudication, as measured by ACD and ICD, but not with peripheral hemodynamic measures.",

    "abstract": "Arterial stenting across joints is not recommended because of increased risk of in-stent focal neointimal hyperplasia and compression or fracture of the stent by joint motion with decreased long-term patency. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of placing stents in the venous system across the inguinal ligament.\nFrom 1997 to 2006, 177 limbs with chronic non-malignant obstructive lesions had stents placed in the iliofemoral venous outflow across the inguinal ligament into the common femoral vein. Transfemoral venograms and duplex ultrasound scans to assess cumulative patency rates, cumulative rates, site of in-stent restenosis (ISR), and structural integrity of the stents were performed during follow-up. The results were compared to the findings in 316 limbs with stents terminating cephalad to the inguinal ligament.\nOverall cumulative secondary patency (CSP) rate at 54 months was greater in the limbs with cephalad than in those caudad stent termination in relation to the inguinal ligament (95% and 86%, respectively; P = .0001). Although CSP of limbs with non-thrombotic obstruction was 100% regardless of the site of stent termination, that of the limbs stented for thrombotic obstruction was greater for stents terminating cephalad than for those caudad to the ligament (90% and 84%, respectively; P = .0378). However, a comparison of CSP rates between limbs treated for thrombotic occlusion and those with thrombotic non-occlusive obstruction at 32 months revealed no difference whether or not the stent was placed across the inguinal ligament (occlusion 77% and 77%, P = .7540, non-occlusive obstruction 96% and 95%, P = .7437). Severe ISR (> or =50%) were rare, 5%. The cumulative rate was, however, not significantly different in limbs stented cephalad and caudad to the inguinal ligament (7% and 11%, respectively, P = .6393). Focal in-stent recurrent stenosis at the site of the inguinal ligament occurred in only 7% of limbs (all <50%). None of the braided stainless steel stents were compressed or fractured.\nContrary to arterial stenting, braided stainless stents can be safely placed in the venous system across the inguinal crease with no risk of stent fractures, narrowing due to external compression, focal development of severe in-stent restenosis, and no effect on long-term patency. The patency rate is not related to the length of stented area or the placement of the stent across the inguinal ligament, but is dependent upon the etiology and whether the treated postthrombotic obstruction is occlusive or non-occlusive.",

Although CSP of limbs with non-thrombotic obstruction was 100% regardless of the site of stent termination, that of the limbs stented for thrombotic obstruction was greater for stents terminating cephalad than for those caudad to the ligament (90% and 84%, respectively; P = .0378). However, a comparison of CSP rates between limbs treated for thrombotic occlusion and those with thrombotic non-occlusive obstruction at 32 months revealed no difference whether or not the stent was placed across the inguinal ligament (occlusion 77% and 77%, P = .7540, non-occlusive obstruction 96% and 95%, P = .7437). Severe ISR (> or =50%) were rare, 5%. The cumulative rate was, however, not significantly different in limbs stented cephalad and caudad to the inguinal ligament (7% and 11%, respectively, P = .6393). Focal in-stent recurrent stenosis at the site of the inguinal ligament occurred in only 7% of limbs (all <50%). None of the braided stainless steel stents were compressed or fractured.",

A 5010 Palmaz stent (Cordis Corp, Miami Lakes, Fla) is asymmetrically hand-crimped on an appropriately sized valvuloplasty balloon that assures that the proximal (cranial) aspect will deploy first. A long 16 to 20F sheath is placed distal to the target area. Once the balloon and stent assembly is in position, the sheath is partially retracted to allow only the proximal (cranial) half of the balloon to expand, flaring the unsheathed proximal stent. The expanded proximal balloon prevents cranial stent migration. The sheath prevents distal (caudal) stent migration. Full retraction of the sheath allows the distal balloon and stent to expand, completing the stent deployment.",

Moreover, standard methods used to detect venous obstruction, such as maximal venous outflow, are inadequate as they typically test patients at rest and in the supine position when the pathophysiology of CVD is defined in the upright patient performing exercise. This report describes a patient with incapacitating venous claudication in whom standard noninvasive venous function tests were normal and whose phlebography was interpreted as showing no evidence of venous obstruction. A postocclusive reactive hyperemic technique was used to unmask significant outflow obstruction, leading to operative correction and subsequent symptom resolution.",

However, symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency may appear over time. We describe our surgical experience with 4 patients who underwent iliac vein ligation followed by venous bypass with a modified Palma derivation between 48 and 240 hours after sustaining penetrating abdominal trauma with concomitant iliac vein injury. Patients were assessed for venous symptoms and conduit patency with continuous wave Doppler and duplex scanning. One graft occluded acutely and the remaining three remain patent with functioning valves. In order to preserve venous outflow after severe iliac vein injury, we think that venous ligation as a part of damage control surgery followed by a modified Palma operation may prevent chronic symptoms of venous outflow obstruction without compromising an already injured patient.",

These patients may have symptoms of Raynaud syndrome, or they may have ischemic ulcerations of their fingers. Hypothenar hammer syndrome with involvement of the ulnar artery is much more frequently encountered than thenar hammer syndrome, which is caused by damage to the radial artery. We report a patient with symptomatic occlusion of both the radial and ulnar arteries secondary to repetitive trauma to the palm of his hand. In our review of the literature, we found two reports involving a total of four patients with similar findings. Both conservative and surgical treatments have been used successfully. Avoidance of the precipitating activities is important in long-term management of these patients.",

Patient demographics, pre- and post-procedure ankle-brachial indices (ABI), and anatomic factors (including categorization by TASC II classification, lesion length, and runoff vessel status) were analyzed. Outcomes evaluated included freedom from restenoses, freedom from re-intervention, overall patency, and assisted-patency.\nA total of 237 total limbs were treated during the period reviewed. The study group included 108 TASC B and 32 TASC C limbs in 125 patients (mean age 73.1 +/- 10.4 years, male sex: 59%). Seventy-one percent of patients were Rutherford classification 2/3 while the remaining 29% were Rutherford classification 4/5. Mean follow-up period was 12.7 months (range, 1-52 m). Forty-one (41) limbs experienced restenosis or occlusion at a mean time of 8 months (range, 1-24 m). Freedom from restenosis/occlusion was 58.9% at 12 months and 47.9% at 24 months. Predictors of restenosis included a preoperative ABI <0.5 (hazard ratio [HR] 3.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-6.86, P = .007) and hypercholesterolemia (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.11-5.25, P = .025). Lesion length as a continuous variable (per centimeter) also correlated with a higher risk of restenosis (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00-1.12, P = .057). The overall assisted-primary and secondary-patency rates were 87% and 94% respectively at 3 years with no significant differences between TASC B and TASC C limbs.\nEndovascular interventions for TASC II B and C lesions are associated with restenosis/occlusion rates that are at least as good as those of open femoropopliteal bypass surgery from historical, previously published series. Furthermore, overall assisted-patency rates are excellent, although low preoperative ABIs continue to be associated with worse outcomes.",

    "abstract": "While aggressive endoluminal therapy for superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusive disease is commonplace, the implications of runoff on long-term outcomes of these interventions in patients with rest pain and tissue loss is unclear. Runoff is known to negatively effect graft patency. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of distal runoff on long-term outcomes of SFA interventions for critical ischemia.\nA prospective database of patients undergoing endovascular treatment of the SFA between 1986 and 2007 was queried. Patients with Rutherford symptom classification 4, 5, and 6 were selected. Patients with concomitant tibial interventions were excluded. Pre-operative angiograms were reviewed in all cases to assess distal popliteal and tibial runoff and were scored according to modified Society of Vascular Surgery criteria for both vessels such that a higher score implies worse runoff (minimum 1 and maximum 19). Three runoff score groups were identified: <5 (good), 5-10 (compromised), and >10 (poor). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to assess time-dependent outcomes. Multivariate and factor analyses were performed.\nThree hundred six limbs in 241 patients (57% male, mean age 68 years) underwent endovascular treatment for critical ischemia (44% rest pain and 56% tissue loss.) Technical success was 96% with 61% SFA undergoing angioplasty, 37% SFA primary stenting and 2% SFA an atherectomy. Overall mortality was 1% and overall morbidity was 16% at 90 days after the procedure. At 5 years, vessels with compromised and poor runoff had significantly worse cumulative patency (82 +/- 9%, 56 +/- 4%, and 52 +/- 7% for good, compromised, and poor runoffs, respectively, mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]). Freedom from recurrent symptoms (65 +/- 8%, 39 +/- 9%, and 18 +/- 9% for good, compromised, and poor runoffs, respectively) and limb salvage (65 +/- 5%, 41 +/- 4%, and 20 +/- 6% for Good, Compromised, and Poor runoffs, respectively) were incrementally curtailed by worsening runoff with significant decreases as runoff category deteriorated.\nIn patients presenting with rest pain and tissue loss who are treated with SFA percutaneous interventions, patency is negatively affected by compromised and poor runoffs in keeping with the bypass literature. More importantly, freedom from recurrent symptoms and limb salvage are incrementally curtailed as runoff scores worsen. These findings are consistent with the bypass literature.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective review examines periprocedural morbidity and early functional responses to primary renal artery angioplasty and stenting (RA-PTAS) for patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease (RVD).\nConsecutive patients undergoing primary RA-PTAS for hemodynamically significant atherosclerotic RVD with hypertension and/or ischemic nephropathy were identified from a prospectively maintained registry. Hypertension responses were determined based on pre- and post-intervention blood pressure measurements and medication requirements. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was used to determine renal function responses. Both hypertension and renal function responses were assessed at least three weeks after RA-PTAS. Stepwise multivariable regression analysis was used to examine associations between blood pressure and renal function responses to RA-PTAS and select clinical variables.\nOne-hundred ten primary RA-PTAS were performed on 99 patients with atherosclerotic RVD with a mean angiographic diameter-reducing stenosis of 79.2 +/- 12.9%. All patients had hypertension (mean of 3.4 +/- 1.3 antihypertensive agents). Mean pre-intervention eGFR was 49.9 +/- 22.7 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and 74 patients had a pre-intervention eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The technical success rate for RA-PTAS was 94.5%. The periprocedural complication rate was 5.5%; there were no periprocedural deaths. Statistically significant decreases in mean systolic blood pressure (161.3 +/- 25.2 vs. 148.5 +/- 25.2 post-intervention, P < .0001), diastolic blood pressure (78.6 +/- 13.3 versus 72.5 +/- 13.5 post-intervention, P < .0001), and number of antihypertensive agents (3.3 +/- 1.2 versus 3.1+/- 1.3 post-intervention, P = .009) were observed. Assessed categorically, hypertension response to RA-PTAS was cured in 1.1%, improved in 20.5%, and unchanged in 78.4%. Categorical eGFR response to RA-PTAS was improved in 27.7%, unchanged in 65.1%, and worsened in 7.2%. Multivariable stepwise regression revealed associations between pre- and post-intervention systolic blood pressure (P < .0001), diastolic blood pressure (P < .0001), and eGFR (P < .0001), as well as a trend toward improved diastolic blood pressure response among patients managed with staged bilateral intervention (P = .0589).\nPrimary RA-PTAS for atherosclerotic RVD was associated with low peri-procedural morbidity and mortality but only modest early improvements in blood pressure and renal function. Results from ongoing prospective trials are needed to assess the long term outcomes associated with RA-PTAS and clarify its role in the management of atherosclerotic RVD.",

The goal of this article is to report a highly detailed, closely monitored, audited, pooled multicenter cohort of open surgical abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repairs that has potential for use in future EVAR studies as a control data set.\nOpen surgical AAA repair data from four investigational device exemption clinical aortic endograft trials were tested for poolability, merged, and analyzed for the intervals of 0 to 30 days and 31 to 365 days.\nThe data set includes 323 open patients (83% men; mean age, 70 years). Operative mortality at 30 days was 2.8%. The mean age of women was 3 years older than men, and mortality at 30 days for women was 5.7% compared with 2.2% for men (P = .18). Operative mortality for patients with large AAAs (>/=5.5 cm, 3.6%) was not different than for patients with small aneurysms (<5.5 cm, 2.4%, P = .54). All-cause mortality at 1 year was 6.7%, with significant predictors including age, sex, and renal failure. Women had 2.6-fold greater 1-year all-cause mortality rate (13.2%) than men (5.4%, P = .04), but statistical significance was lost after correction for age. Two additional AAA-related deaths occurred between days 31 and 365, resulting in a 1-year AAA-related mortality of 3.5%.\nThis data set provides a tightly controlled, thoroughly detailed, and audited experience that has the potential to serve as an open control group for future EVAR trials.",

    "abstract": "Controversy regarding the efficacy of duplex ultrasound surveillance after infrainguinal vein bypass led to an analysis of patient and bypass graft characteristics predictive for development of graft stenosis and a decision of secondary intervention.\nRetrospective analysis of a contemporary, consecutive series of 353 clinically successful infrainguinal vein bypasses performed in 329 patients for critical (n = 284; 80%) or noncritical (n = 69; 20%) limb ischemia enrolled in a surveillance program to identify and repair duplex-detected graft stenosis. Variables correlated with graft stenosis and bypass repair included: procedure indication, conduit type (saphenous vs nonsaphenous vein; reversed vs nonreversed orientation), prior bypass graft failure, postoperative ankle-brachial index (ABI) < 0.85, and interpretation of the first duplex surveillance study as \"normal\" or \"abnormal\" based on peak systolic velocity (PSV) and velocity ratio (Vr) criteria.\nOverall, 126 (36%) of the 353 infrainguinal bypasses had 174 secondary interventions (endovascular, 100; surgery, 74) based on duplex surveillance; resulting in 3-year Kaplan-Meier primary (46%), assisted-primary (80%), and secondary (81%) patency rates. Characteristics predictive of duplex-detected stenosis leading to intervention (PSV: 443 +/- 94 cm/s; Vr: 8.6 +/- 9) were: \"abnormal\" initial duplex testing indicating moderate (PSV: 180-300 cm/s, Vr: 2-3.5) stenosis (P < .0001), non-single segment saphenous vein conduit (P < .01), warfarin drug therapy (P < .01), and redo bypass grafting (P < .001). Procedure indication, postoperative ABI level, statin drug therapy, and vein conduit orientation were not predictive of graft revision. The natural history of 141 (40%) bypasses with an abnormal first duplex scan differed from \"normal\" grafts by more frequent (51% vs 24%, P < .001) and earlier (7 months vs 11 months) graft revision for severe stenosis and a lower 3-year assisted primary patency (68% vs 87%; P < .001). In 52 (15%) limbs, the bypass graft failed and 20 (6%) limbs required amputation.\nThe efficacy of duplex surveillance after infrainguinal vein bypass may be enhanced by modifying testing protocols, eg, rigorous surveillance for \"higher risk\" bypasses, based on the initial duplex scan results and other characteristics (warfarin therapy, non- single segment saphenous vein conduit, redo bypass) predictive for stenosis development.",

    "abstract": "Several reports in the literature have described the value of regional cerebral oximetry (rSO(2)) as a neuromonitoring device during carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The use of rSO(2) is enticing because it is simpler and less expensive than other neuromonitoring modalities. This study was performed to compare the efficacy of rSO(2) with electroencephalography (EEG) and median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) in determining when to place a shunt during CEA.\nFrom October 2000 to June 2006, 323 CEAs were performed under general anesthesia by six surgeons. Shunting was done selectively on the basis of EEG and SSEP monitoring under the auspices of an intraoperative neurophysiologist. All patients were retrospectively reviewed to see if significant discrepancies existed between EEG/SSEP and rSO(2).\nTwenty-four patients (7.4%) showed significant discrepancies. Sixteen patients showed no significant EEG/SSEP changes, but profound changes occurred in rSO(2), and no shunt was placed. In seven patients there was no change in rSO(2) but a profound change occurred in EEG/SSEP, and shunts were placed. In one patient early in the series, the EEG and SSEP were unchanged but the rSO(2) dropped precipitously, and a shunt was placed. In the 299 patients who showed no discrepancies, 285 were not shunted and 14 required a shunt. Two strokes occurred in the entire series (0.6%), none intraoperatively. Shunts were placed in 23 patients (7%). The sensitivity of rSO(2) compared with EEG/SSEP was 68%, and the specificity was 94%. This gave a positive-predictive value of 47% and a negative-predictive value of 98%.\nRelying on rSO(2) alone for selective shunting is potentially dangerous and might have led to intraoperative ischemic strokes in seven patients and the unnecessary use of shunts in at least 16 patients in this series. The use of rSO(2) adds nothing to the information already provided by EEG and SSEP in determining when to place a shunt during CEA.",

All endovascular repairs were approached through a surgically exposed femoral artery and a percutaneously accessed femoral artery. Study endpoints included all-cause mortality and morbidity. Follow-up imaging consisted of contrast-enhanced CT scans and plain abdominal x-rays at 1, 6, 12 months, and annually postoperatively.\nTechnical success was achieved in 97.9% of test patients, with four failed insertions (three early conversions because of deployment issues, one access failure). Mean follow-up was 4.1 +/- 1.7 years (test group) and 3.1 +/- 1.9 years (control group). Perioperative morbidity and mortality were significantly reduced in the test group compared with the control group (P < .05). At 6 years, all-cause mortality and morbidity was no different in the Powerlink group compared with the open repair group. There were no reported stent fractures, graft disruptions, or aneurysm ruptures. Core laboratory-reported endoleaks included proximal or distal type I (n = 1) and type I/II (n = 3), with no type III or type IV endoleaks.

    "abstract": "Avoidance of nephrotoxic contrast agents during endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR) may reduce the incidence of renal dysfunction following the procedure. Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) angiography is a safe alternative to iodinated contrast media vastly under-utilized by vascular surgeons. We herein describe our experience with a simple angiographic technique using CO(2) for EVAR guidance that does not require a separate angiographic catheter.\nEighteen patients underwent EVAR using angiography with CO(2) delivered through the endograft sheath. The renal and hypogastric arteries were localized for endograft deployment exclusively with CO(2) in all patients. Completion angiography was done with CO(2) in all patients and an additional angiogram with iodinated media was done in 13 cases.\nAll endograft deployments were done successfully with CO(2) angiography injected through the endograft delivery systems and femoral access sheaths. Additional iodinated media completion angiography did not modify the procedure in any case. All patients were discharged within two days after surgery. There were no ischemic or systemic complications related to CO(2) administration. Follow-up CT-scan revealed well positioned endografts with the expected patent renal and hypogastric arteries in all patients, and no additional endoleaks. No significant deterioration in renal function occurred in any case.\nCarbon dioxide angiography conducted through the endograft delivery sheath is reliable for endograft deployment, safe, non-toxic and inexpensive. In addition, it may expedite EVAR by eliminating a number of angiographic catheter placements and exchanges during the procedure. This favorable experience warrants further utilization of this technique.",

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of a MMP inhibitor, doxycycline, on EVAR.\nPatients undergoing EVAR were randomized to doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) or placebo for 6 months following the procedure. Clinical data, blood samples, and computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained preoperatively, postoperatively (blood only), and at 1- and 6-month follow-up. Forty-four subjects were analyzed based on intention-to-treat.\nPlasma MMP-9 decreased significantly below baseline in the doxycycline (N = 20) treated patients at 6 months (-16.4% +/- 20.7%, P < .05) while there was a nonsignificant increase in the placebo (N = 24) group (128.1% +/- 73.5%). This was primarily related to changes between 1 and 6 months. In patients with endoleaks at 6 months, plasma MMP-9 increased in 83% of the placebo treated patients, but in only 14% of the doxycycline treated group (P < .03). Among endoleak-free patients with AneuRx or Excluder endografts, doxycycline treatment resulted in greater decreases in maximum aortic diameter than placebo treatment (-13.3% +/- 3.3% vs -3.8% +/- 3.0%, P < .05). Furthermore, doxycycline treatment significantly reduced the aortic neck dilatation at 6 months in Excluder treated patients.\nThere is evidence of persistent MMP release representing ongoing aortic degradation after endografting which can be inhibited by doxycycline therapy. In analyses based on the endograft used, treatment with doxycycline also demonstrated evidence of increased aortic dimensional stability, a surrogate marker for long-term success of EVAR. Although encouraging, these results require confirmation in larger patient populations. Doxycycline should undergo more thorough evaluation as a potential adjuvant treatment to improve the results of EVAR, particularly in certain subgroups.",

    "abstract": "Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) is a minimally invasive technique for treating great saphenous vein (GSV) reflux for several years. We report our experience with EVLA and evaluate its effectiveness.\nA consecutive series of patients (639 women [60%] and 421 men [40%], age 23 to 79 years) were treated by EVLA for GSV reflux and tributary varices at our institution. A questionnaire was used to assess preoperative and postoperative symptoms. The primary outcomes for assessing safety were mortality and morbidity, including laser-related adverse events, postoperative infection, thrombotic events, etc. Effectiveness was assessed by the obliteration of the vein, disappearance of varicosities, and so on.\nAll patients tolerated the procedure well, recovered uneventfully, and returned to daily activities and work 3 days and 10 to 14 days, respectively, after the operation. Treatment with EVLA plus ligation of the GSV resulted in occlusion in all cases at 2 weeks follow-up and in 1169 of 1186 (99%) at 6-month follow-up; the rate of retreatment was low (36/1186). Complications were minor and improved quickly.\nEVLA can reduce and relieve symptoms associated with varicose veins and achieve cosmetic goals. Vein emptying before exposure to laser energy and compression treatment afterwards may improve results.",

    "abstract": "The optimal duplex ultrasound (DUS) velocity criteria to determine in-stent carotid restenosis are controversial. We previously reported the optimal DUS velocities for >or=30% in-stent restenosis. This prospective study will further define the optimal velocities in detecting various severities of in-stent restenosis: >or=30%, >or=50%, and 80% to 99%.\nThe analysis included 144 patients who underwent carotid artery stenting as a part of clinical trials. All patients had completion arteriograms and underwent postoperative carotid DUS imaging, which was repeated at 1 month and every 6 months thereafter. Patients with peak systolic velocities (PSVs) of the internal carotid artery (ICA) of >or=130 cm/s underwent carotid computed tomography (CT)/angiogram. The PSVs and end-diastolic velocities of the ICA and common carotid artery (CCA) and the PSV of the ICA/CCA ratios were recorded. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to determine the optimal velocity criteria for the diagnosis of >or=30, >or=50, and >or=80% restenosis.\nThe mean follow-up was 20 months (range, 1-78 months). Available for analysis were 215 pairs of imaging (DUS vs CTA/angiography) studies. The accuracy of CTA vs carotid arteriogram was confirmed in a subset of 22 patients (kappa = 0.81). The ROC analysis demonstrated that an ICA PSV of >or=154 cm/s was optimal for >or=30% stenosis with a sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 89%, positive-predictive value (PPV) of 96%, negative-predictive value (NPV) of 97%, and overall accuracy (OA) of 96%. An ICA EDV of 42 cm/s had sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and OA in detecting >or=30% stenosis of 86%, 62%, 87%, 60%, and 80%, respectively. An ICA PSV of >or=224 cm/s was optimal for >50% stenosis with a sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 90%, PPV of 99%, NPV of 90%, and OA of 98%. An ICA EDV of 88 cm/s had sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and OA in detecting >or=50% stenosis of 96%, 100%, 100%, 100%, 53%, and 96%. An ICA/CCA ratio of 3.439 had sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and OA in detecting >or=50% stenosis of 96%, 100%, 100%, 100%, 58%, and 96%, respectively. An ICA PSV of >or=325 cm/s was optimal for >80% stenosis with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 99%, PPV of 100%, NPV of 88%, and OA of 99%. An ICA EDV of 119 cm/sec had sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and OA in detecting >or=80% stenosis of 99%, 100%, 100%, 100%, 75%, and 99%, respectively. The PSV of the stented artery was a better predictor for in-stent restenosis than the end-diastolic velocity or ICA/CCA ratio.\nThe optimal DUS velocity criteria for in-stent restenosis of >or=30%, >or=50%, and >or=80% were the PSVs of 154, 224, and 325 cm/s, respectively.",

The aim of this article is to investigate the population-based prevalence of pathologic reflux in superficial and deep leg veins, taking into account factors as gender, age, and clinical classification of venous disease.\nIn a population-based cross-sectional study, 3072 subjects aged 18 to 79 years (1350 male, 1722 female, response 59%) were enrolled from October 2000 through November 2001. A standardized interview was conducted to document phlebological history and clinical examinations including duplex sonography of selected superficial and deep leg veins. Pathological reflux was defined as being >500 ms. All participants where classified according to the CEAP classification.\nUsing the highest clinical stage per participant, 9.6% where classified C0, 59.0% C1, 14.3% C2, 13.5% C3, 2.9% C4, and 0.7% C5-C6. A pathological reflux (>500 ms) was found in 35.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 33.6-37.1) of subjects with 21.0% (95% CI 19.5-22.5) showing reflux in at least one superficial vein and 20.0% (95% CI 18.6-21.5) showing reflux in at least one deep vein. We observed significantly higher reflux prevalence for the superficial veins in women while for the deep veins reflux prevalence were significantly higher in men. Prevalence of reflux in the superficial veins markedly increases with age. In the deep venous system, no clear changes in reflux prevalence with age can be observed. For superficial veins, reflux prevalence is markedly higher with higher C-stages. For the deep veins, the proportion of refluxes is relatively constant in stages C0-C3 with a distinct increase of prevalence from stage C4 onward.\nOur results show a high prevalence of reflux both for the superficial and the deep venous system. Reflux prevalence is associated with gender, age, and the clinical stage as measured by the CEAP classification. Further longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the relevance of pathological reflux in subjects with otherwise healthy veins.",

    "abstract": "For good rehabilitation candidates, the biomechanical advantages of the end weight-bearing through-knee amputation (TKAmp) compared with the above knee amputation (AKA) are well established. However, the TKAmp has been abandoned by vascular surgeons because of poor wound healing rates related to long tissue flaps and challenges to prosthetic fitting related to the femoral condyles. Since 1998, we have performed the modified \"Mazet\" technique TKAmp procedure that creates shorter flaps to close the wound and greatly facilitates prosthesis fitting. The purpose of this study is to review our results with TKAmp in patients with peripheral vascular disease who were not candidates for below-knee amputation.\nThe records of all patients who underwent through-knee amputation between 1998 and 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. Mean follow-up was 33 months (range, 38 days to 99 months). Amputations for trauma and malignancy were excluded. Patient survival, maintenance of ambulation, and independent living status were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis methods.\nFifty patients underwent TKAmp using a modified Mazet technique. The mean age was 63 years; 50% were men, and 50% had diabetes mellitus. All patients had peripheral arterial disease. Thirty-five patients (70%) had prior revascularization procedures. Those patients averaged 2.2 revascularization procedures prior to amputation. There were three (6%) perioperative deaths. The ipsilateral common femoral artery was patent in 43/50 (86%) of patients at the time of amputation. Forty patients (80%) had open wounds and three patients (6%) had a failed below-knee amputation at the time of TKAmp. Thirty-eight patients (81%) healed their TKAmp wound. Nine patients failed to heal and were revised to an above knee amputation. The cumulative probability of regular prosthetic usage and maintenance of ambulation was estimated to be 0.56 at 3 years and 0.41 at 5 years. The probability of maintaining independent living status at 3 and 5 years was 0.77 and 0.65, respectively. Survival probabilities for patients in this series were 0.60 at 3 years and 0.44 at 5 years.\nThese data show that the TKAmp is associated with an acceptable primary healing rate and satisfactory functional outcomes in patients with peripheral arterial disease. The advantages of TKAmp over AKA make it the preferred alternative for patients with vascular disease who are candidates for prosthetic rehabilitation.",

Thirty-five patients (70%) had prior revascularization procedures. Those patients averaged 2.2 revascularization procedures prior to amputation. There were three (6%) perioperative deaths. The ipsilateral common femoral artery was patent in 43/50 (86%) of patients at the time of amputation. Forty patients (80%) had open wounds and three patients (6%) had a failed below-knee amputation at the time of TKAmp. Thirty-eight patients (81%) healed their TKAmp wound. Nine patients failed to heal and were revised to an above knee amputation. The cumulative probability of regular prosthetic usage and maintenance of ambulation was estimated to be 0.56 at 3 years and 0.41 at 5 years. The probability of maintaining independent living status at 3 and 5 years was 0.77 and 0.65, respectively.

    "abstract": "Risk factors are similar for the development of both thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) and other cardiovascular diseases. Coronary artery disease is highly prevalent in patients with TAA, with a reported prevalence of 30% to 70%. Knowledge of the underlying cardiac pathology can minimize perioperative risk and improve patient selection. This study investigated the feasibility of simultaneous assessment of thoracic aortic pathology and cardiac structures and function, including the coronary arteries, using electrocardiogram-gated 64-slice computed tomography (CT) angiography.\nECG-gated 64-detector row CT examinations of 11 patients (8 men, 3 women; mean age, 67 +/- 16; range, 41-83 years) with thoracic aortic pathology, including aneurysms and dissections, were reviewed. Images were assessed for coronary artery disease, calcifications, cardiac function, and valve characteristics. Simultaneous assessment and measurements of thoracic aortic pathology were performed with the same scan.\nAll images of the patients could be successfully assessed for calcium scores, coronary artery stenoses, coronary artery anomalies, interventricular septal wall thickness, myocardial scar, left ventricular ejection fraction, muscle mass, and aortic and mitral valve calcification, mobility, and valve anatomy. Diagnostic image quality was also achieved in all patients for the underlying thoracic aortic disease.\nThis study introduces the feasibility of dynamic imaging of the thoracic aorta and cardiac structures and function, including the coronary arteries, with just one CT scan. The images could be successfully assessed for thoracic aorta pathology, cardiac disease, and extracardiac pathology. With further developments of CT scanners-and more detailed insight in the prognosis of patients based on ECG-gated CTA findings-this new technique may become the initial imaging modality for preoperative cardiac risk stratification in patients with TAAs or dissections.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to examine the effect of various surgical maneuvers during standard surgery for small saphenous varicose veins (SSV).\nThis was a prospective cohort study of patients that underwent small saphenous varicose vein surgery. Two-hundred nineteen consecutive patients (234 legs) with isolated primary or recurrent small saphenous varicose veins undergoing surgery were enrolled in a multicenter study involving nine vascular centers in the United Kingdom. Operative technique was determined by individual surgeon preference; clinical and operative details, including the use of stripping, were recorded. Clinical examination (recurrence rates) and duplex imaging (superficial and deep incompetence) were evaluated at six weeks and one year after surgery.\nA total of 204 legs were reviewed at one year; 67 had small saphenous varicose vein stripping, 116 had saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ) disconnection only, and the remainder had miscellaneous procedures. The incidence of visible recurrent varicosities at one year was lower after SSV stripping (12 of 67, 18%) than after disconnection only (28 of 116, 24%), although this did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant difference in the rate of numbness at one year between those who had SSV stripping (20 of 71, 28%) and those who had disconnection only (38 of 134, 28%). The rate of SPJ incompetence detected by duplex at one year was significantly lower in patients who underwent SSV stripping (9 of 67, 13%) than in those who did not (37 of 115, 32%) (P < .01).\nStripping of the SSV significantly reduced the rate of SPJ incompetence after one year without increasing the rate of complications.",

    "abstract": "Fusion of the spine is often performed from an anterior approach requiring mobilization of aorta, iliac artery, and vein. This study describes the preferred techniques and incidence of vascular complications at a spine center.\nInformation and operative notes on all consecutive patients undergoing anterior exposure were entered into a database that was retrospectively reviewed. Four hundred eighty-two procedures performed on 480 patients at one spine center between January of 1997 and December of 2002 were analyzed. Demographics, technique, levels of exposure, and history of prior spine surgery were recorded. Primary outcomes measured included intraoperative vascular complications, estimated operative blood loss, and operative mortality. Vascular injury was defined as any case in which a suture was required to control bleeding. Major vascular injuries were defined as those requiring transfusion, vascular reconstruction, or blood loss greater than 300 cc.\nAn intraoperative vascular injury occurred in 11% (54/480) of patients. The majority of these (45/54) were minor injuries treated with simple suture repair. Nine (1.9%) major vascular injuries did occur; the majority identified and treated during the exposure and not the spinal fusion. One patient required a return to the operating room 24 hours after the initial procedure for removal of packs placed to control severe bleeding from an avulsed branch of the internal iliac vein. Median estimated blood loss (EBL) was 150 cc and there were no mortalities. Eighty-three percent of overall injuries involved exposure of L4-5, and this was statistically significant odds ratio (OR) 2.73, P = .005. The lowest incidence of injury occurred when L5-S1 alone was exposed (5.1% of injuries) OR .34, P = .01. Prior spine procedures did not significantly increase the risk of injury, P = .67. Other factors that did not significantly increase risk included gender, multiple levels vs single levels and technique of exposure.\nExposure to the lumbar spine can be readily accomplished via a retroperitoneal approach. Minor vascular injuries during exposure, mostly venous, are not uncommon and are easily repaired. They are increased when L4-5 is part of the exposure and are lowest when L5-S1 alone is exposed. Major injuries occur in less than 2% of patients.",

Preoperative workup included scoring ischemia-related symptoms according to a modified ranking scale (mRS), carotid duplex scan, transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and head computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. All patients underwent neurological assessment on admission, 1 day before and 2 days after CEA, and at discharge. A complete neurological and ultrasound follow-up was performed at 1, 6, and 12 months after CEA, then yearly. All procedures were eversion CEA under deep general anesthesia, with selective shunting. Endpoints were perioperative (30-day) stroke/mortality rate or cerebral bleeding and long-term stroke recurrence or cerebral hemorrhage.\nBetween 2000 and 2005, 102 patients with a mRS </= 2 underwent CEA within a median 8 days of acute ischemic stroke. Shunting and contralateral carotid occlusion were found significantly correlated. There were no perioperative strokes or deaths, or cerebral hemorrhage.

About 46% were women, and mean patient age was 77.1 (SD, 7.5) years. During the study period, the percentage of patients treated with a statin in each group increased considerably, from 9.8% to 55.3% in all atherosclerotic patients (P < .01), from 11.8% to 61.2% in CAD patients (P < .01), from 5.3% to 41.2% in CVD patients (P < .01), and from 6.8% to 43.3% in PAD patients (P < .01). During the entire study period, the percentage of statin users was lowest among PAD and CVD patients, followed by patients with both a history of PAD and CVD.\nThe use of statin therapy in elderly patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis has increased substantially during the past decade, but many patients remain untreated.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of protein deficiency in outpatients presenting with leg ulcers and the parameter's prognostic value for wound outcome.\nProspective controlled observational study.\nAmbulatory patients referred for chronic wounds to four university hospitals.\nConsecutive out-patients with a leg ulcer present for at least 2 months, related to venous insufficiency, associated or not with moderate peripheral arterial disease (ankle-brachial pressure index > 0.7), were included in a prospective study. Wound evaluation (area and occurrence of complications) was performed at baseline and at 12 weeks of follow-up. Biologic nutrition assessment (serum albumin, transthyretin, c-reactive protein) was performed at baseline. The control group consisted of consecutive patients free of leg ulceration and attending the dermatology outpatient clinic for remissive skin cancer or miscellaneous skin disorders.\nForty one patients and 43 controls were included. Serum albumin level was under 35 g/L (normal values: 36-44 g/L) in 27% of the patients and 2% of the controls (P < .001). At 12 weeks, 34% of the patients had an increase in wound area. Wound infections occurred in 12% (n = 5) of the patients. Protein deficiency was independently associated with an increase in wound area at 12 weeks (P = .034) and the presence of an inflammatory syndrome was associated with the occurrence of wound complications (wound infection or hospitalization) during follow-up (P < .001).\nThe prevalence of protein deficiency in out-patients with leg ulcers is high and significantly associated with a poor healing prognosis.",

    "abstract": "While autogenous arteriovenous access is preferred, prosthetic arteriovenous grafts (AVG) are still required in a large number of patients. Infection of AVGs occurs frequently and may cause life-threatening bleeding or sepsis. Multiple treatment strategies have been advocated (ranging from graft preservation to excision with complex concomitant reconstructions), indicating a lack of consensus on appropriate management of infected AVGs. We undertook this study to evaluate if, in the setting of anastomotic involvement, brachial artery ligation distal to the origin of the deep brachial artery accompanied by total graft excision (BAL) is safe and effective.\nAll prosthetic arteriovenous graft infections managed by a single surgeon between 1995 and 2006 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were identified from a computerized vascular registry, and data were obtained via patient charts and the electronic medical record.\nWe identified 45 AVG infections in 43 patients. Twenty-one patients (49%) demonstrated arterial anastomotic involvement and were treated with BAL; these form the cohort for this analysis. Mean patient age was 53.2 (SD 9.5) years. The primary etiologies for end stage renal disease (ESRD) were hypertension (29%), HIV (24%), and diabetes (19%). An upper arm AVG was present in 95% of patients; one (5%) had a forearm AVG. The majority of grafts were polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (90%). Follow-up was 100% at 1 month, 86% at 3 months, and 67% at 6 months. No ischemic or septic complications occurred in the 21 patients who underwent BAL.\nBAL is an effective and expeditious method to deal with an infected arm AVG in frequently critically ill patients with densely scarred wounds. In the short term, BAL appears to be well tolerated without resulting ischemic complications. Further study with longer duration of follow-up is necessary to ascertain whether BAL results in definitive cure, or whether patients may ultimately manifest ischemic changes and require additional intervention.",

    "abstract": "Long-term patency remains a significant hurdle in the minimally invasive treatment of arteriosclerosis in the superficial femoral (SFA) and popliteal arteries. CryoPlasty therapy (PolarCath, Boston Scientific Corp, Natick, Mass) is a novel approach designed to significantly reduce injury, elastic recoil, neointimal hyperplasia, and constrictive remodeling. The technique combines the dilatation forces of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with cold thermal energy applied to the plaque and vessel wall. We previously reported a technical success rate of 96% and a 12-month freedom from restenosis rate of 82.2%. However, a review of the original cohort supplemented by experience with a further 47 lesions has demonstrated less desirable results.\nFrom December 2003 through July 2007, 92 lesions in 64 consecutive patients were treated and followed up for a median of 16 months with statistically significant follow-up at 24 months.\nThe immediate technical success rate was 88%. Nine stents were immediately required after unsuccessful CryoPlasty (9.8%) five of which were as a result of a dissection. No unanticipated adverse events occurred, specifically, no thrombus, acute occlusions, distal embolizations, aneurysms, or groin complications. Vascular calcification was responsible for technical failure in six of the 11 immediately unsuccessful procedures. Freedom from restenosis for successfully treated lesions was 57% and 49% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. CryoPlasty of heavily calcified lesions, vein graft lesions, and in-stent stenosis faired poorly. Excluding these lesions from analysis would have resulted in an immediate success of 94% (81 of 86) and freedom from restenosis of 61% and 52% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. However, on an intention-to-treat basis, freedom from restenosis was 47% and 38% at 12 and 24 months, and CryoPlasty added approximately $1700 to the cost of each procedure.\nAnalysis of this expanded, longer-term data suggests that our earlier, smaller study provided an overly optimistic appraisal of the benefits of CryoPlasty. It is possible that a larger analysis might have identified a subset of patients or lesions that would benefit from CryoPlasty, but considering the additional cost, we no longer use this technique in our practice.",

    "abstract": "Classic studies of limb ischemia-reperfusion injury have been performed using young healthy mice. However, patients with peripheral vascular disease are older and often exhibit metabolic derangements that may delay healing after revascularization. Mice with genetic deletion of apolipoprotein E (ApoE(-/-)) have been used as a model in various experimental scenarios of hypercholesterolemia. These experiments evaluated the inflammatory response and changes in skeletal muscle morphology during the acute and chronic phases of limb ischemia-reperfusion injury in aged ApoE(-/-) mice.\nAge-matched ApoE(-/-) and wild-type (Wt) mice underwent 1.5 hours of unilateral hind limb ischemia, followed by 1, 7, or 14 days of reperfusion (DR). Histologic analysis of skeletal muscle fiber injury was assessed at 1DR. Morphologic evidence of muscular fiber maturation was assessed at 14DR. Levels of MyoD and myogenin, markers of skeletal muscle differentiation, were assessed at 7 and 14DR using Western blots. Markers of inflammation, including myeloperoxidase, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and osteopontin, were assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) using Western blots at 1, 7, and 14DR. After 1DR, tissue adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) levels were measured to assess metabolic activity. Unpaired t test and Mann-Whitney test were used for comparisons.\nHistologic evaluation of skeletal muscle after 1DR showed no difference in the degree of injury between Wt and ApoE(-/-) mice. However, at 14DR, ApoE(-/-) mice had higher percentage of immature muscle fibers than Wt mice. Myogenin level was lower in the ApoE(-/-) mice at 7DR. Injured skeletal muscle of ApoE(-/-) mice had lower levels of myeloperoxidase than Wt mice at 7 DR and higher levels of MCP-1 at 14DR. There was no difference in the levels of tissue ATP, MIP-2, osteopontin, or CCR2 at all experimental intervals.\nAlthough there was no difference between the injured muscle of Wt and ApoE(-/-) mice during the acute phase of reperfusion, ApoE(-/-) mice showed delay in skeletal muscle healing during the chronic phase of reperfusion. This lag in muscle regeneration was associated with lower levels of myogenin at 7DR and an increased level of MCP-1 at 14DR in the ApoE(-/-) mice. The delay in skeletal muscle healing in the ApoE(-/-) mice may have broader implications for poor tissue healing and functional recovery in elderly patients who have vascular risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic surgery is sometimes complicated by subacute or delayed paraplegia. Pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta has been implicated in extensive inflammation and progressive neurodegeneration after ischemia. Using a rabbit model, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in a temporal fashion.\nSpinal cord ischemia was induced by aortic cross-clamping in New Zealand White rabbits. The animals were assigned to three groups. Group C (n = 20) received saline (0.2-mL) and Group I (n = 20) received IL-1ra (200-microg/0.2-mL) intrathecally just after reperfusion. Group S (n = 3) underwent sham operation without aortic occlusion. We assessed the neuroprotective effects of IL-1ra by evaluating neurological function, histopathological changes, and in-situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL staining). We also measured the levels of Nitric Oxide (NO) and S100beta in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Each evaluation was performed sequentially within 120 hours after reperfusion.\nGroup C showed progressive deterioration of motor function which became statistically significant from 48 hours after the onset of reperfusion (P < .05, P < .01, P < .001, P < .001 at 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours, respectively). Compared to Group C, a higher number of viable neurons was observed with less severe spinal cord injury in Group I (P < .01, .05 and .05 at 24, 72, and 120 hours, respectively). TUNEL-positive neurons were also significantly reduced by the administration of IL-1ra (P <.01 and .05 at 24, and 120 hours, respectively). The difference between Group C and Group I with regard to NO was significant at 72 and 120 hours (P < .05), while that in terms of S100beta was significant only at 24 hours (P < .05).\nAdministration of IL-1ra attenuates spinal cord ischemic-reperfusion injury as evidenced by reducing both neuronal necrosis and apoptosis.",

After exercise, recovery half-time of calf muscle StO(2) was attained at 129 +/- 98 seconds, whereas full recovery to the resting value was reached at 225 +/- 140 seconds. After adjusting for sex, race, and grouping according to the initial decline constant in calf muscle StO(2) during exercise, the exercise time to minimum calf muscle StO(2) was correlated with the ischemic window (r = -0.493, P = .002), ICD (r = 0.339, P = .043), and ACD (r = 0.680, P < .001). After treadmill exercise, the recovery half-time of calf muscle StO(2) was correlated with the ischemic window (r = 0.531, P < .001), ICD (r = -0.598, P < .001), and ACD (r = -0.491, P = .003).\nIn patients limited by intermittent claudication, shorter ICD and ACD values are associated with reaching a minimum value in calf muscle StO(2) sooner during treadmill exercise and with having a delayed recovery in calf muscle StO(2) after exercise.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported recently that resveratrol preconditioning can protect the brain from ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, it was unclear whether resveratrol administration after stroke was beneficial to the delayed phases after focal cerebral ischemia injury. This study investigated the effects and possible protective mechanism of resveratrol on the delayed phase after focal cerebral ischemia injury in mice.\nMice were randomly assigned to five groups according to the time of administration of resveratrol. Control group mice received a corresponding volume of saline solution (0.9% NaCl) containing 20% hydroxypropyl h-cyclodextrin by gavage and were exposed to middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion and reperfusion injury. The treatment groups received resveratrol (50 mg/kg/d, gavage) until day 7. Ischemia group mice received their first dose 5 minutes before MCA ischemia, reperfusion group mice received their first dose 5 minutes before MCA reperfusion, first-day, group mice received their first dose 24 hours after MCA reperfusion, and third-day group mice received their first dose at 72 hours after MCA reperfusion. Brain injury was evaluated by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and neurologic examination 7 days after reperfusion. The microvascular cell number was examined with immunohistochemistry staining. Effect of resveratrol on matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression was investigated with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot.\nThe mean neurologic scores and infarct volumes of the ischemia and reperfusion groups were lower than that of the control group at 7 days after MCA reperfusion (P < .05). Immunohistochemistry staining showed significantly less reduction in the number of microvessels in the cortical area of mice of the ischemia and reperfusion groups compared with controls. The ischemic hemispheres of the ischemia and reperfusion groups showed significantly (P < .05) elevated levels of protein of MMP-2 and VEGF.\nResveratrol administration by gavage provided an important neuroprotective effect on focal cerebral ischemic injury in the delayed phase. The elevated MMP-2 and VEGF levels might be important in the neuroprotective effect of resveratrol administration by inducing angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the results of left subclavian artery (LSA) coverage during thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR).\nWe retrospectively reviewed the results of 308 patients who underwent TEVAR from 1999 to 2007. The LSA was completely covered in 70 patients (53 men, 13 women), with a mean age of 67 years (range 41-89). Elective revascularization of the LSA was performed in 42 cases, consisting of transposition (n = 5), bypass and ligation (n = 3), or bypass and coil embolization (n = 34). Mean follow-up was 11 months (range, 1-48 months). The chi(2) test was used for statistical analysis.\nIndications for treatment included aneurysm in 47, dissection in 16, transection in 4, pseudoaneurysm in 2, and right subclavian aneurysm in 1, with 47 elective and 23 emergency operations. Aortic coverage extended from the left common carotid artery (LCCA) to the distal arch (n = 29), middle thoracic aorta (n = 9), or celiac artery (n = 32). Operative success was 99%. The 30-day mortality was 4% (intraoperative myocardial infarction, 1; traumatic injuries, 1; visceral infarction, 1). No paraplegia developed. The stroke rate was 8.6%; no strokes were related to LSA coverage because there were no posterior strokes. Stroke rates between the revascularization (7%) and non-revascularization (11%) groups were not significantly different (P = .6). All but one patient fully recovered by 6 months. No left arm symptoms developed in patients with LSA revascularization. All bypasses remained patent throughout follow-up. One complication (2%) resulted in an asymptomatic persistently elevated left hemidiaphragm, likely related to phrenic nerve traction. Left upper extremity symptoms developed in five (18%) patients without LSA revascularization. Two required LSA revascularization, one of which was for acute limb-threatening ischemia. No permanent left upper extremity dysfunction or ischemia developed in any patient.\nZone 2 TEVAR with LSA coverage can be accomplished safely in both elective and emergency settings and with and without revascularization (with the exception of a patent LIMA-LAD bypass). Nevertheless, overall stroke rates are higher compared with all-zone TEVAR. Staged LSA revascularization and even urgent revascularization may be necessary but can be performed without long-term detriment to the left arm.",

    "abstract": "The long-term patency of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) suffers from a high incidence of primary failure due to early thrombosis, myointimal hyperplasia at the venous access site, or failure to mature. A multidisciplinary meeting in vascular access surgery was initiated to optimize the timing, indication, type of intervention, and the logistics of AVFs/AVGs during the preoperative and postoperative period. This study evaluated the influence of the new optimized care protocol on the incidence of revisions (surgical and endovascular) and patency rates.\nThis protocol for vascular access surgery of AVFs/AVGs for hemodialysis was introduced in January 2004. It was initiated with the presence of the vascular surgeons, nephrologists, interventional radiologists, dialysis nurses, and the ultrasound technicians. Every patient who needed an AVF/AVG because of long-term treatment of chronic renal failure or awaiting kidney transplantation, or who needed a revision of an AVF/AVG, was discussed. Two groups were compared. Group I patients were treated with an AVF/AVG before the introduction of the new protocol (2001 and 2002). Group II patients were treated with an AVF/AVG after the introduction of the new optimized care protocol (2004 and 2005). Both groups were followed up after 12 months.\nDuring the study period, 146 AVFs/AVGs were attempted, and 111 postoperative revisions were performed to restore primary and secondary patency: 63 in group I (60 surgical, 3 radiology) and 48 in group II (23 surgical, 25 radiology). Significantly more segmental access replacements (P < 0.027) occurred in group I than in group II. Significantly fewer surgical revisions (P < 0.019) and more endovascular balloon angioplasties (P < 0.001) occurred in group II. Significantly higher cumulative primary and secondary patency rates of all AVFs/AVGs (P < 0.001), radial-cephalic direct wrist AVFs (P < 0.001), and brachial-cephalic forearm looped transposition AVGs (P < 0.001) were achieved in group II after follow-up.\nThe new protocol outlined in a bimonthly multidisciplinary meeting for vascular access surgery of AVFs/AVGs for hemodialysis resulted in more effective logistics according to preoperative diagnostics and operation. More importantly, a significant increase in endovascular balloon angioplasties and a significant decrease in surgical revisions was observed, resulting in less patient morbidity. Also, higher primary and secondary patency was achieved after the introduction of the new optimized care protocol.",

    "abstract": "This report summarizes the 30-day and 12-month results of endovascular treatment using the Medtronic Vascular Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, Calif) for patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) who are considered candidates for open surgical repair.\nThe study was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, pivotal trial conducted at 38 sites. Enrollment occurred between December 2003 and June 2005. Standard follow-up interval examinations were prescribed at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. These endovascular results were compared with retrospective open surgical data from three centers of excellence.\nThe Evaluation of the Medtronic Vascular Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System for the Treatment of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms (VALOR) trial enrolled 195 patients, and 189 were identified as retrospective open surgical subjects. Compared with the open surgery group, the VALOR test group had similar age and sex distributions, but had a smaller TAA size. Patients received a mean number of 2.7 +/- 1.3 stent graft components. The diameters of 25% of the proximal stent graft components implanted were <26 mm or >40 mm. Left subclavian artery revascularization was performed before the initial stent graft procedure in 5.2% of patients. Iliac conduits were used in 21.1% of patients. In 33.5% of patients, the bare spring segment of the most proximally implanted device was in zones 1 or 2 of the aortic arch. In 194 patients (99.5%), vessel access and stent graft deployment were successful at the intended site. The 30-day VALOR results included perioperative mortality, 2.1%; major adverse advents, 41%; incidence of paraplegia, 1.5%; paraparesis, 7.2%; and stroke, 3.6%. The 12-month VALOR results included all-cause mortality, 16.1%; aneurysm-related mortality, 3.1%; conversion to open surgery, 0.5%; target aneurysm rupture, 0.5%; stent graft migration >10 mm, 3.9%; endoleak (12.2%), stent graft patency, 100%; stable or decreasing aneurysm diameter, 91.5%; and loss of stent graft integrity, four patients. No deployment-related events or perforation of the aorta by a graft component occurred. The Talent Thoracic Stent Graft showed statistically superior performance with respect to acute procedural outcomes (P < .001), 30-day major adverse events (41% vs 84.4%, P < .001), perioperative mortality (2% vs 8%, P < .01), and 12-month aneurysm-related mortality (3.1% vs 11.6%, P < .002) vs open surgery.\nThe pivotal VALOR 12-month trial results demonstrate that the Medtronic Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System is a safe and effective endovascular therapy as an alternative to open surgery in patients with TAA who were considered candidates for open surgical repair.",

Compared with the open surgery group, the VALOR test group had similar age and sex distributions, but had a smaller TAA size. Patients received a mean number of 2.7 +/- 1.3 stent graft components. The diameters of 25% of the proximal stent graft components implanted were <26 mm or >40 mm. Left subclavian artery revascularization was performed before the initial stent graft procedure in 5.2% of patients. Iliac conduits were used in 21.1% of patients. In 33.5% of patients, the bare spring segment of the most proximally implanted device was in zones 1 or 2 of the aortic arch. In 194 patients (99.5%), vessel access and stent graft deployment were successful at the intended site. The 30-day VALOR results included perioperative mortality, 2.1%; major adverse advents, 41%; incidence of paraplegia, 1.5%; paraparesis, 7.2%; and stroke, 3.6%. The 12-month VALOR results included all-cause mortality, 16.1%; aneurysm-related mortality, 3.1%; conversion to open surgery, 0.5%; target aneurysm rupture, 0.5%; stent graft migration >10 mm, 3.9%; endoleak (12.2%), stent graft patency, 100%; stable or decreasing aneurysm diameter, 91.5%; and loss of stent graft integrity, four patients. No deployment-related events or perforation of the aorta by a graft component occurred. The Talent Thoracic Stent Graft showed statistically superior performance with respect to acute procedural outcomes (P < .001), 30-day major adverse events (41% vs 84.4%, P < .001), perioperative mortality (2% vs 8%, P < .01), and 12-month aneurysm-related mortality (3.1% vs 11.6%, P < .002) vs open surgery.",

    "abstract": "Dextran-40 is effective in reducing postoperative Doppler-detectable embolization in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Dextrans are thought to have antithrombotic and antiplatelet effects. The mode of action is unclear. In rats, dextran blocks uptake of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) by mannose-binding receptors. Because this would have the effect of enhancing endogenous fibrinolysis, we explored this effect of dextran-40 on fibrinolysis in man.\nTwenty patients undergoing endovascular stenting for abdominal aortic aneurysm were randomized to receive 100 mL of 10% dextran-40 or saline, over 1 hour, during their operation in addition to heparin. Blood samples were taken preoperatively, intraoperatively (immediately after operative procedure), and 24 hours postoperatively. Thrombi were formed in a Chandler loop and used to assess endogenous fibrinolysis over 24 hours, measured as the fall in thrombus weight, and the release of fluorescently labelled fibrinogen from the thrombus. Plasma samples were analyzed for markers of fibrinolysis; plasmin-antiplasmin (PAP), PAI-1, and t-PA, and for functional von Willebrand factor (vWF). Platelet response to thrombin and other agonists was measured by flow cytometry.\nThrombi formed ex vivo from the intraoperative blood samples from the dextran-treated patients exhibited significantly greater fibrinolysis vs preoperative samples, seen both as a significantly greater percentage reduction in thrombus weight (from 34.7% to 70.6% reduction) and as an 175% increase in the release of fluorescence (P < .05). Fibrinolysis returned to baseline levels the next day. No change was seen in the saline-treated group. Plasma levels of PAP and PAI-1 increased significantly postoperatively in the dextran-treated group vs the saline group (P < .05). The postoperative level of functional VWF was significantly lower in the dextran-treated group vs controls. A specific reduction occurred in the platelet response to thrombin, but not to other agonists, in the intraoperative samples from the dextran-treated group (11.1% vs 37.1%; P = .022), which was not seen in the controls.\nThese data are consistent with a rise in plasmin due to dextran blockade of tPA uptake in vivo, leading to enhanced fibrinolysis, cleavage of vWF and of the platelet protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) thrombin receptor. This suggests that dextran exerts a combined therapeutic effect, enhancing endogenous fibrinolysis, whilst also reducing platelet adhesion to vWF and platelet activation by thrombin. The proven antithrombotic efficacy of low-dose dextran in carotid surgery may be applicable to wider therapeutic use.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to provide insight into the incidence of thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair following previous infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery and to determine whether thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair after prior infrarenal AAA surgery is associated with higher mortality and morbidity rates.\nMEDLINE, Cochrane Library CENTRAL, and EMBASE databases were searched for relevant articles. Selected articles were critically appraised and meta-analyses were performed.\nA total of 12.4% of patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms and 18.7% of patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms have had prior AAA surgery. The chance of developing a thoracic aortic aneurysm in patients with AAA is 2.2% and 2.5% for developing a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. The mean time interval between prior AAA surgery and subsequent thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgery or detection is 8.0 years with a wide variation between individuals. Surgery in these patients is technically feasible. The 30-day mortality of patients undergoing open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair does not significantly differ from patients without prior AAA surgery and the 30-day mortality is 11.8%. No data were available about mortality of patients with prior AAA repair undergoing thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery. Morbidity risks are higher in patients with thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Prior AAA repair was a significant risk factor for neurological deficit after thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms surgery with relative risks (RRs) of 11.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.8-32.3, P value < .0001) and 2.90 (95% CI 1.26-6.65, P value = .008), respectively. Prior AAA repair was a significant risk factor for developing renal failure in patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.74-6.91, P value = .0001). Determinants of the prognosis in these patients include distal aortic perfusion, distal extent of the landing zone of the graft, drainage of cerebrospinal fluid for thoracic aortic aneurysm repair and age, history of cardiac diseases, extent of the aneurysm, rupture, amount of estimated blood loss, aortic clamp time, and visceral ischemic times for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.\nA considerable group of patients with thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms have had prior AAA repair. The risk of postoperative morbidity is increased in these patients. Mortality appears to be similar for patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Patients with prior AAA repair undergoing thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair should be provided maximum care to protect their spinal cord and renal function.",

    "abstract": "Superficial venous hypertension has been cited as the putative etiologic factor in advanced chronic venous insufficiency with venous ulcer (CEAP C 5/6). For over a century, influenced by this belief, surgeons have ablated the superficial venous system as a treatment for venous ulcer. Incompetent perforating veins (ICPVs) have become a particular focus of this therapeutic strategy. This review examines the evidence for the surgical approach. A MEDLINE search of the literature identified only four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) directed at the surgical reduction of superficial venous hypertension. Risk ratios for ulcer healing and prevention of recurrence were calculated to determine benefits for these four RCTs, while mortality and morbidity, where available, was used to determine risk from the procedure. In addition, the quality of the trials (design and outcomes) was assessed. While two trials compared ICPV ligation to compression, the great saphenous vein (GSV) was also treated in many of these limbs, which confounds the results. By contrast, two RCTs, which compared treatment of the GSV alone to compression, demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of ulcer recurrence. Case series that employed hemodynamic or surrogate outcomes showed little effect on the addition of ICPV treatment to GSV stripping, while GSV ablation alone was associated with a reduction in the number of ICPVs in several studies. This review suggests a grade 1A recommendation for the treatment of venous ulcer by GSV ablation to reduce ulcer recurrence. The role of ICPV ablation alone or concomitant with GSV treatment awaits results of properly conducted RCTs.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of death due to cardiovascular disease increases steeply in vascular surgery patients with increasing age. Observational data in coronary heart disease and heart failure patients suggest that elderly patients are less optimally treated compared to younger patients. The aim of this study was to examine the differences in clinical characteristics and medical therapy of the elderly compared to younger patients in vascular surgery. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of statins on 1-year mortality in an unselected patient population.\nData on 711 consecutive peripheral vascular surgery patients were collected from 11 hospitals in The Netherlands in 2004. Elderly patients were defined as patients with an age above 70 years. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify clinical characteristics and medical therapy associated with older age. The effect of statins on 1-year mortality was assessed with Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.\nThe mean age was 67 +/- 10 years and 299 (42%) patients were older than 70 years of age. Elderly patients showed a significant higher cardiac risk profile according to the Lee Cardiac Risk Index (Lee-Index) (>/=2 risk factors: 50% vs 32% in younger patients, P < .001). Multivariable analysis showed that older patients presented with a significant higher Lee-Index, a higher incidence of cardiac arrhythmias (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-3.3) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.7-4.7). However, smoking (OR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.3-0.7) was less common in the elderly. Statins were significantly less often prescribed in the elderly (OR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.4-0.8), although a beneficial effect of statins on 1-year mortality (HR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1-0.7) was observed.\nElderly patients undergoing vascular surgery had a higher cardiac risk profile than younger patients. Despite this high cardiac risk and the beneficial effect, our study demonstrated that statins were less often used in elderly patients.",

    "abstract": "The distal part of the internal carotid artery (ICA) close to the skull base can be reached surgically with different approaches. Exposure using the standard lateral incision is eventually limited by bony structures which preclude the wide-angled operative field necessary for en bloc resection of tumors or primary vascular pathology that abuts the parapharyngeal space. In these unusual cases, use of a combined midline mandibulotomy and neck incision provides necessary operative exposure.\nWe report our experience using combined midline mandibulotomy and neck incision for exposure of high carotid lesions. We also discuss different surgical and endovascular approaches in light of the literature.\nFive patients were operated on for high ICA lesions: 2 for malignant head and neck tumors, 1 for an extended paraganglioma, and 2 for large symptomatic ICA aneurysms. All ICAs were reconstructed with an autologous vein interposition graft and the distal anastomoses were performed within the most distal 3 cm of the ICA adjacent to the orifice of bony carotid canal.\nAll operations were technically successful with no operative mortality or strokes. One aneurysm patient and the paraganglioma patient had minimal long-term sequelae from this procedure. One patient with an extended lingual epidermoid carcinoma was recurrence free at 3.6 years. One aneurysm patient died due to aspiration pneumonia 30 days postoperatively and another patient had early recurrent tumor growth and died due to that after 15 months. Four patients (80%) suffered a major cranial nerve injury in the operation mainly due to the extensive nature of the disease process.\nExposure of the distal carotid artery using midline mandibulotomy is rarely required. However, this technique represents an excellent option for cases of malignancies arising from the oral cavity which abut the carotid artery and instances in which primary carotid pathology extends medially alongside the parapharyngeal space. Performance of these cases should be accomplished by a multidisciplinary surgical team comprised of head and neck and vascular specialists. High rates of cranial nerve deficits should be anticipated.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective study examines the relationship between the renal resistive index (RI) and blood pressure and renal function response after open and percutaneous intervention for atherosclerotic renovascular disease (AS-RVD).\nFrom March 1997 to December 2005, 86 patients (46 women, 40 men; mean age, 68 +/- 10 years) underwent renal duplex sonography (RDS), including main renal artery and hilar vessel Doppler interrogation, before treatment of AS-RVD. Of these, 56 patients had open operative repair, and 30 had percutaneous intervention. The RI (1-[EDV/PSV]) was calculated from the kidney with the highest peak systolic velocity (PSV). Hypertension response was graded from preprocedural and postprocedural blood pressure measurements and medication requirements. Renal function response was graded by a >or=20% change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated from the serum creatinine concentration.\nComorbid conditions, baseline blood pressure, and preoperative renal function were not significantly different between open and percutaneous groups. Baseline characteristics that differed between the percutaneous vs open group were higher mean age (71 +/- 11 years vs 67 +/- 9 years; P = .05), kidney length (11.3 +/- 1.3 cm vs 10.7 +/- 1.2 cm; P = .02), proportion of patients with RI >or=0.8 (50% vs 21%; P = .01), and proportion of bilateral AS-RVD (37% vs 80%; P < .01). After controlling for preintervention blood pressure and extent of repair, postoperative eGFR differed significantly for RI <0.8 or >or=0.8 when all patients (P = .003) and percutaneous intervention (P = .008) were considered. Specifically, eGFR declined from preprocedure to postprocedure in the patients with RI >or=0.8 after percutaneous repair and in the group analyzed as a whole. Neither systolic nor diastolic pressure after intervention demonstrated an association with RI. Considering all patients and both groups, multivariable proportional hazards regression models demonstrated that RI was predictive of all-cause mortality. RI was the most powerful predictor of death during follow-up (hazard ratio, 6.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-17.2; P < .001).\nAfter intervention for AS-RVD, RI was associated with renal function, but not blood pressure response. A strong, independent relationship between RI and mortality was observed for all patients and both treatment groups.",

    "abstract": "Spinal fluid drainage reduces paraplegia risk in thoracic (TAA) and thoracoabdominal (TAAA) aortic aneurysm repair. There has not been a comprehensive study of the risks of spinal fluid drainage and how these risks can be reduced. Here we report complications of spinal fluid drainage in patients undergoing TAA/TAAA repair.\nThe study comprised 648 patients who had TAA or TAAA repair from 1987 to 2008. Spinal drains were used in 486 patients. Spinal fluid pressure was measured continuously, except when draining fluid, and was reduced to <6 mm Hg during thoracic aortic occlusion and reperfusion. After surgery, spinal fluid pressure was kept <10 mm Hg until patients were awake with normal leg lift. Drains were removed 48 hours after surgery. Spinal and head computed tomography (CT) scans were performed in patients with bloody spinal fluid or neurologic deficit. We studied the incidence of headache treated with epidural blood patch, infection, bloody spinal fluid, intracranial and spinal bleeding on CT, as well as the clinical consequences.\nTwenty-four patients (5%) had bloody spinal fluid. CT exams showed seven had no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, 14 (2.9%) had intracranial blood without neurologic deficit, and three with intracranial bleeding and cerebral atrophy had neurologic deficits (1 died, 1 had permanent hemiparesis, and 1 with transient ataxia recovered fully). Two patients without bloody spinal fluid or neurologic deficit after surgery presented with neurologic deficits 5 days postoperatively and died from acute on chronic subdural hematoma. Neurologic deficits occurred after spinal fluid drainage in 5 of 482 patients (1%), and 3 died. The mortality from spinal fluid drainage complications was 0.6% (3 of 482). By univariate and multivariate analysis, larger volume of spinal fluid drainage (mean, 178 mL vs 124 mL, P < .0001) and higher central venous pressure before thoracic aortic occlusion (mean, 16 mm Hg vs 13 mm Hg, P < .0012) correlated with bloody spinal fluid.\nStrategies that reduce the volume of spinal fluid drainage but still control spinal fluid pressure are helpful in reducing serious complications. Patients with cerebral atrophy are at increased risk for complications of spinal fluid drainage.",

Nineteen days later, the gene expressing ephrin-B2 (ephrin group) or beta-galactosidase gene (control group) was adenovirally transfected to the cultured auto-fibroblasts (5 x 10(6) cells); then 48 hours later, the gene-transduced cells were injected through the left internal iliac artery of the same rabbit. At 28 days after injection, the development of collateral vessels and their function were assessed (control group, n = 12; ephrin group, n = 10).\nThe gene expressing ephrin-B2 was successfully transferred to the rabbit autofibroblasts, and ephrin-B2, expressed on the cell membrane, possessed binding ability with its receptor, Eph-B4.

    "abstract": "Quality of life (QoL) is a crucial outcome measure in patients with lower limb ischemia (LLI). The Short Form 36 (SF36) has been proposed as the gold standard instrument for generic QoL analysis in patients with LLI. The Short Form 8 (SF8) was developed from the SF36 and we aim to compare these two instruments in terms of validity, reliability, and responsiveness.\nOne hundred ninety-three patients, 135 men and 58 women, median age 66 (range, 44-84) years with LLI completed the SF36 and the SF8. Disease severity was graded according to International Society of Cardiovascular Surgery (ISCVS) suggested reporting standards. Correlation between the two instruments' like domains and non-like domains reflects convergent and divergent validity respectively. A subgroup of 58 patients (44 men) completed two sets of questionnaires, with an intervening period of 2 weeks. Correlation between these two sets of questionnaires was used to analyze test/retest reliability. Spearman's rank correlation was used to analyze validity and reliability. Responsiveness of the individual domains across the whole group was analyzed using the Kruskall-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, while responsiveness between the groups of patients with varying severity of LLI was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test.\nThere was greater correlation between like domains of SF36 and the SF8 than the non-like domains suggesting good convergent-divergent validity. Test/retest reliability was significant for both instruments (r(s) > 0.7). Increasing LLI resulted in a statistically significant deterioration in all eight domains of both instruments. The time taken was significantly shorter and less assistance was required to complete the SF8 than the SF36.\nThe SF8 is a valid and reliable QoL instrument in patients with LLI, and as it is simpler and quicker to complete, we suggest it may challenge the SF36 as the gold standard generic QoL analysis instrument in LLI.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) leads to frequent embolic brain lesions; their source has not been clearly identified yet. In order to investigate this phenomenon, we have evaluated embolic brain lesions (BL) after CAS and correlated them with aortic arch (AA) characteristics.\nThe AAs of 59 patients undergoing CAS under distal protection were evaluated by angiography and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). AAs were stratified according to morphology (type I and II \"simple\" vs type III and bovine \"difficult\"), atherosclerotic arch lesions (complicated: >5 mm or with mobile debris vs uncomplicated: <5 mm), and tortuosity index (TI; sum of all angles diverging from ideal carotid axis, <150 vs >150). Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) was performed before and within 24 hours from CAS. New BL were considered ipsilateral (IL) if ipsilateral to the site of CAS and non-ipsilateral (CL) if contralateral to it or bilateral. Normality distribution was by Shapiro-Wilk test (variables reported as medians +/- interquartile range) and statistical significance (P < .05) by Wilcoxon and Fisher's exact test.\nDifficult arches were present in 17 patients (28.8%), complicated aortic plaque in 21 (35.5%), and TI > 150 in 34 (57.6%). New BL appeared in 34 or 57.6% patients (6 or 18% IL and 28 or 82% CL). The mean number of BL was 5.7 (range, 0 to 20), 4.7 IL, and 5.7 CL, with a median volume of 560.95 +/- 1677.7 mm(3). Type of arch and TI were not correlated with mean number of BL. Mean volume of BL were greater in patients with difficult AA, complicated plaques, and TI > 150 (258 (572) mm(3) vs 15.6 (353) mm(3), P = .2; and 86 (828) mm(3) vs 85.9 (352) mm(3), P = .4 172 (766) mm(3) vs 0 (228) mm(3), P = .06, respectively). In patients with all three AA characteristics, mean number and volume of BL was significantly greater compared with other patients. Specifically, this increase was due mainly to CL (IL 0 (117) mm(3) vs 0 (172) mm(3), P = .9; CL 564 (687) mm(3) vs 0 (133) mm(3), P = .001). None of the technical details considered was correlated with either IL or CL.\nBL are frequent after protected CAS and are correlated with AA characteristics, thus underlining the role of catheterization maneuvers in determining embolic events. TEE may be useful in patient's selection for CAS.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous iliofemoral venous stenting has been shown to be effective, safe, and durable in both nonthrombotic iliac vein lesion (NIVL) and postthrombotic disease. A small fraction of stented limbs require reintervention to correct stent malfunction. This manuscript examines the reasons for reintervention, types of procedures performed, and outcome.\nFemoro-ilio-caval stenting was performed in 1085 limbs over a 10 year period from 1997 to 2007 (NIVL/postthrombotic limb ratio 1:1). Reinterventions were required in 137 limbs (13%) for non-occlusive stent malfunction.\nMedian time of reintervention after the initial procedure was 15 months. Primary indication for reintervention was stent abnormalities discovered on routine surveillance imaging in 31% of the limbs and residual/recurrent symptoms after initial stenting in 69% of the limbs. Prevalent symptoms before reintervention were swelling (45%), pain (18%), combination of pain and swelling (33%), and venous dermatitis/ulcer (15%). Seventy-seven percent of limbs required only a single reintervention and 23% required two or more interventions. The type of reintervention could be broadly categorized into four types: (1) cephalad stent extension to correct stent outflow problems; (2) caudad stent extension to correct inflow problems; (3) balloon dilatation of stent stenoses; and (4) combinations. The types of stent inflow/outflow lesions encountered were different in NIVL and postthrombotic limbs. In both groups, the external iliac vein segment had a greater incidence of pathology than other stented venous segments during reintervention. A denovo stenotic lesion of uncertain aetiology that occurred below an existing stent was also exclusive to the external iliac vein segment. Instent restenosis (ISR) occurred in both subsets. Two types of ISR were encountered: (1) a 'soft' lesion probably due to reduced flow channel lined by thrombus within the stent from inflow/outflow problems and (2) a 'hard' lesion that occurred independently, was resistant to dilatation and tended to recur unlike the 'soft' lesion. Cumulative improvement in pain and swelling at 18 months following intervention was 67% and 72%, respectively. Complete cumulative healing of venous dermatitis/ulcer was 90% at 12 months post reintervention.\nVenous stenting for chronic venous disease is largely trouble-free with only a small fraction of the stented limbs requiring reinterventions. Reinterventions were performed to correct previously overlooked or new defects in inflow, outflow and/or the stent. Reinterventions are worthwhile since they improve residual/recurrent symptoms in a durable fashion.",

    "abstract": "This review describes and evaluates the results of laparoscopic aortic surgery.\nWe describe the different laparoscopic techniques used to treat aortic disease, including (1) total laparoscopic aortic surgery (TLS), (2) laparoscopy-assisted procedures including hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS), and (3) robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery, with their current indications. Results of these techniques are analyzed in a systematic review of the clinical series published between 1998 and 2008, each containing >10 patients with complete information concerning operative time, clamping time, conversion rate, length of hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality.\nWe selected and reviewed 29 studies that included 1073 patients. Heterogeneity of the studies and selection of the patients made comparison with current open or endovascular surgery difficult. Median operative time varied widely in TLS, from 240 to 391 minutes. HALS had the shortest operating time. Median clamping time varied from 60 to 146 minutes in TLS and was shorter in HALS. Median hospital stay varied from 4 to 10 days regardless of the laparoscopic technique. The postoperative mortality rate was 2.1% (95% confidence interval, 1.4-3.0), with no significant difference between patients treated for occlusive disease or for aneurysmal disease. Conversion to open surgery was necessary in 8.1% of patients and was slightly higher with TLS than with laparoscopy-assisted techniques (P = .07).\nAnalysis of these series shows that laparoscopic aortic surgery can be performed safely provided that patient selection is adjusted to the surgeon's experience and conversion is liberally performed. The future of this technique in comparison with endovascular surgery is still unknown, and it is now time for multicenter randomized trials to demonstrate the potential benefit of this type of surgery.",

    "abstract": "The most recent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines recommend that the order of preference for arteriovenous fistula (AVF) placement is the radial-cephalic primary AVF, followed by the secondary brachiocephalic (BC) and, if either of these is not viable, then brachiobasilic (BB) AVF should be fashioned. However, there is limited prospective data comparing technical and clinical outcomes of these two approaches. The purpose of our study was to compare outcome, patency, and complication rates in these two autogenous upper arm AV accesses.\nBetween December 2003 and and January 2007, patients (61 male, 39 female) who have lost more distal AVFs were enrolled in the study. After preoperative duplex mapping, patients with patent both basilic and cephalic veins greater than 3 mm of diameter were randomized into BCAVF and BBAVF groups, each group consisting of 50 patients. All procedures were performed under local anesthesia as one-stage procedures. Follow-up data were prospectively collected. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate primary and secondary patency rates. Univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analysis was used to find risks for the occurrence of thrombosis.\nBaseline demographics, clinical characteristics, and preoperative history dialysis access were comparable between groups with the exception of the fact that mean caliber of the basilic veins were larger (4.51 +/- 0.93 mm vs 3.90 +/- 0.1 mm; P = .002). The mean duration of operation was significantly shorter in the BC group compared with the BB group (P < .001). There was no significant difference in the thirty day mortality, wound complications, 24 hour thrombosis, postoperative hemorrhage, maturation, and time to maturation between the groups. Mean follow-up was 43.2 +/- 1.8 months. Primary patency at 1 and 3 years of follow-up was 87% and 81% for the BC group and 86% and 73% for the BB group (P = .7) Secondary patency at one and three year follow-up was 87% and 70% for the BC group and 88% and 71% for the BB group, respectively (P = .8). Twenty-eight patients (28%) in the BC (18 patients) and BB (10 patients) group died with a patent fistula during the follow-up period (P = .18). Multivariate analysis revealed that use of dominant arm increased the risk of fistula failure.\nWe conclude that brachiobasilic and brachiocephalic AVF are equally effective alternatives; however, a longer and demanding operation with BB AVF construction should be considered.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to assess the outcome of neovalve construction in two consecutive series of patients affected by postthrombotic syndrome and valve agenesis. The technique was modified in the second series so as to correct a cause of failure.\nBetween December 2000 and June 2007, 40 neovalve constructions were carried out in 36 patients (19 males, 17 females, median age 57, range, 29-82) affected by deep venous insufficiency. Thirty-two patients were affected by postthrombotic syndrome and 4 by valve agenesis. The 32 patients with postthrombotic syndrome were selected from among 76 patients with resistant ulcers classified C (6,S) E (S) A (S,D,P) P (R,RO) and the 4 patients with valve agenesis were selected from among 28 affected by resistant ulcers classified as C (6,S) E (C) A (S,D,P) P (R). The patients were subdivided into 2 groups. The first group included 19 operations performed in the period between December 2000 and December 2004, with a median follow-up of 54 months (range, 31-78). The second group included 21 patients operated on between January 2005 and June 2007, with a median follow-up of 5 months (range, 2-29). In the second group, a surgical variation was applied in order to prevent flap collapse and to maintain the continence of the neovalve.\nIn the first series, ulcer healing was observed in 16 cases out of 19 (84%). Recurrent ulcers were observed in one case after 3 years. Valve competence was ascertained in 13 cases per 803 patient-months (1.6/100 patient-months). With regard to the second series, competence was achieved in all cases with a cumulative rate of 21 per 228 patient-months (9.2/100 patient-months). In the second series, the ulcer failed to heal in one case and recurred in two cases, with an intention-to-treat ulcer recurrence rate of three cases per 209 patient-months. Postoperative deep-venous thrombosis was observed in 3 patients in the first series. None was detected in the second series. The mortality rate was 0 and in neither group was pulmonary embolism detected.\nThe modified technique applied to the second group seemed to improve valve continence results significantly. However, a longer follow-up period is required for the latter group to validate this technical enhancement.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence has suggested that bone marrow derived progenitor cells may contribute to the development of intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury, a process that classically has been believed to involve extracellular matrix deposition and the migration and proliferation of cells within the arterial wall. The first studies demonstrating the existence of bone marrow derived cells in the neointima employed mouse models of arterial injury in conjunction with whole bone marrow transplant. Later studies have shown specifically that bone marrow derived hematopoietic or mesenchymal stem cells can be recruited to the neointima and differentiate into smooth muscle cells or endothelial cells. Although the data vary widely depending on different animal models of arterial injury and methods of labeling bone marrow derived cells, it appears that progenitor cells do indeed contribute to intimal hyperplasia, at least in mouse models of arterial injury. To date, signaling molecules such as c-kit and c-kit ligand, and stromal derived factor-1alpha, in addition to matrix metalloproteinase-9, have emerged as critical factors that recruit progenitor cells to sites of arterial injury. While much progress has been made, several tasks remain, including the need for a more in-depth understanding of the mechanisms underlying progenitor cell recruitment, characterization of the involved progenitor cells, and finally validation that the observations made in these mouse models of disease are also applicable to human arterial restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Venous malformations (VMs) are common congenital benign lesions characterized by slow progression. However, intralesional hemorrhage can result in sudden enlargement of the lesions, which, though uncommon clinically, brings difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of this study is to explore the clinical features and diagnosis modality of intralesional hemorrhage in VMs and present our experience with embolosclerotherapy.\nA series of 16 patients were recruited from May 2003 to February 2007, of which fifteen were males and one was female, aged from five months to 40 years (mean, 11.4 years). The anatomic sites affected included cheek (n = 6), upper lid (n = 3), neck (n = 3), parotid region (n = 2), temple (n = 1), and upper limb (n = 1). The period of enlargement varied from one day to 25 days (mean, 8.4 days). Diagnostic needle aspiration was performed to analyze the internal contents of the masses by macroscopic observation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was applied to determine the size, location, and extent of the lesions. Two patients received percutaneous venography. Routine blood testing was carried out in all cases. A combination of absolute alcohol and Bleomycin A5 embolosclerotherapy was administered to the patients. The procedure was repeated after 6 to 8 weeks. Outcomes were assessed by MRI measurement and pre and post treatment color photos.\nAll the patients were diagnosed with hemorrhage in VMs. The volume of the localized lesions varied from 3 cm x 2 cm x 1 cm to 8 cm x 5 cm x 3 cm. Fourteen patients received embolosclerotherapy in one (n = 10) or two (n = 4) sessions. Two cases were not treated and the lesions regressed spontaneously with detectable residual lesions. After a mean follow-up of 25 months (range, 3 to 40 months), treatment was considered effective in 12 patients. The complications were minimal including temporary swelling in 14 treated patients and mild fever in two patients.\nIntralesional hemorrhage in VMs should be distinguished from other lesions in the head and neck region. Diagnostic puncture and MRI are essential for accurate diagnosis. Percutaneous embolosclerotherapy using a combination of absolute ethanol and Bleomycin A5 is a safe and effective treatment of choice.",

    "abstract": "Extracranial carotid artery aneurysms (ECAAs) are rare vascular lesions, and large series with short-term and long-term outcomes are seldom reported. This study compared the clinical presentation and conventional treatment outcomes of different ECAA types according to their etiology.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the data of 55 consecutive patients (47 men, 8 women) with 61 ECAAs who were treated from January 1986 to December 2007 by conventional surgical techniques. The patients were a mean age of 65 +/- 11 years (range, 30-92 years). Thirty-two ECAAs (52.5%) occurred postoperatively after previous carotid endarterectomy, of which 26 patients had 29 degenerative aneurysms (47.5%). Clinical presentation included cerebral stroke in three patients (4.9%) and transient ischemic attack in 26 (42.7%). Mean follow-up was 42.7 +/- 22.0 months. Statistical analysis was performed within and between degenerative and post-reconstructive ECAA subgroups of patients.\nOpen aneurysm resection included 27 extended polytetrafluoroethylene interposition grafts, 12 venous grafts, and 22 closures using synthetic patch. Cumulative 1-year primary patency rates were 86.9% for the degenerative ECAAs and 96% for the postoperative ECAAs, with respective secondary patency rate at 5 years of 80% and 93.3%. The 5-year patency rate was 88.9% for synthetic grafts compared with 66.7% for vein grafts and 86.4% for synthetic patches. These differences were not statistically significant (P > .05). Complications for the degenerative ECAAs included two reconstruction thromboses <30 days, two cerebral strokes, and one myocardial infarction. The patients with postoperative ECAAs experienced one early thrombosis and two strokes postoperatively. Two patients (3.6%) from the degenerative ECAA subgroup died of cardiac decompensation (n = 1) and cerebral ischemic event (n = 1).\nDespite the different trends, no significant differences were found between degenerative ECAA and postoperative ECAA patients in clinical presentation, localization, and surgery outcomes. The good middle-term and long-term patency rates of synthetic graft reconstruction justify its use in the treatment of ECAAs, and it is less time consuming and technically demanding compared with vein interposition graft.",

    "abstract": "Platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF), also known as thymidine phosphorylase (TP) reportedly inhibits vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) migration and proliferation. We hypothesized that adventitial administration of the PD-ECGF/TP gene will suppress intimal hyperplasia and prevent vein graft failure.\nThe study used 68 female rabbits. Rabbit jugular vein was autogenously transplanted into carotid artery with a cuff anastomotic technique. To define vascular wall gene transfer efficiency, poloxamer hydrogel (20%) containing plasmid vector encoding the LacZ gene and different concentrations of trypsin (0%, 0.1%, 0.25%, and 0.5%, n = 5 for each group) was applied to the adventitia of the vein graft. Gene transfer efficiency was evaluated 7 days later by X-gal staining. An additional 48 rabbits received poloxamer hydrogel (20%) containing 0.25% trypsin and the human PD-ECGF/TP gene, LacZ gene, or saline. Intima thickness was evaluated at 2 and 8 weeks after grafting (n = 8 for each group at each time point). Transgene expression was examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting assay, and immunohistochemical staining. Immunohistochemical staining was also used to determine VSMC proliferation, heme oxygenase-1 expression, and macrophage infiltration.\nIncorporation of trypsin into the poloxamer hydrogel significantly increased vessel wall gene transfer. Trypsin at 0.25% and 0.5% resulted in higher gene transfer at the same level without effecting intimal hyperplasia and inflammation; thus, trypsin at 0.25% concentration was used for subsequent experiments. Compared with the LacZ and saline groups, grafts receiving the PD-ECGF/TP gene significantly reduced intimal thickness at 2 and 8 weeks after treatment. The ratio of proliferative VSMC was lower in PD-ECGF/TP treated grafts. Histologic examination of the PD-ECGF/TP transgene grafts demonstrated high expression of heme oxygenase-1, which has been reported to inhibit VSMC proliferation, suggesting that heme oxygenase-1 may be important in the inhibition effect of PD-ECGF/TP on VSMC. No neoplastic or morphologic changes were found in the remote organs.\nA safe and highly efficient gene transfer method was developed by using poloxamer hydrogel and a low concentration of trypsin. Neointimal hyperplasia was significantly reduced by adventitial application of the PD-ECGF/TP gene to the vein graft. Our data suggest that adventitial delivery of the PD-ECGF/TP gene after grafting may be promising method for preventing vein graft failure.",

    "abstract": "Data regarding the long-term efficacy of carotid artery stenting (CAS) are still scarce. As demonstrated by several major randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) vs medical therapy, even after successful carotid revascularization late ipsilateral stroke occurs in 5-13% at 5 years. Therefore, major concerns also remain about the durability of the CAS procedure in terms of stroke prevention. The purpose of this study was to review long-term results after carotid stent implantation in a large cohort of patients.\nThis retrospective investigation involved 3179 CAS procedures performed at four European carotid high-volume centers. Echo-duplex scan using modified velocity criteria to recognize in-stent restenosis (ISR) and neurological examinations of all patients were carried out every 6 months after the procedure. Life-table analysis was used to determine freedom from mortality, stroke-related death, ipsilateral fatal/major stroke, and any ipsilateral stroke. Freedom from ISR and from reintervention were also reported. The secondary aim was to identify predictive risk factors for neurological complications and ISR.\nAt 5 years freedom from mortality, stroke-related death, ipsilateral fatal/major stroke, and any stroke rate were 82%, 93.5%, 93.3%, and 91.9%, respectively. The only predictor for neurological complications was the presence of neurological symptoms before CAS (hazard ratio 1.38 [CI 1.05, 1.82] P = .02). Freedom from restenosis at 1, 3, and 5 years was, respectively, 98.4%, 96.1%, and 94%. Uni- and multi-variate analyses showed that stent characteristics (material/design/free-cell area) were not significantly associated with time to in-stent restenosis or time to reintervention.\nOur long-term results in a large cohort of patients validated CAS as a durable procedure for stroke prevention. The annual rate of neurological complications after CAS was comparable to that of conventional surgery as demonstrated by large RCTs involving both symptomatic patients (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial [NASCET] and European Carotid Surgery Trial [ECST]) and asymptomatic patients (Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study [ACAS] and Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial [ACST]).",

We report the incidence and outcome of soft tissue injury and neuropathy after performing embolo/sclerotherapy for congenital vascular malformations (CVMs) classified according to the Hamburg classification.\nAmong 1823 patients with CVM, 573 were treated with embolo/sclerotherapy. We retrospectively reviewed 68 patients (31 males, 37 females; mean age, 20.0 years) with soft tissue injury and 49 patients (16 males, 33 females; mean age, 21.2 years) with neuropathy. The indications for embolo/sclerotherapy for CVM were that the CVMs affected the quality of life, such as a symptomatic or trauma-prone lesion or a lesion that was impairing the function of a limb, and the lesions that were located near a life-threatening vital area, including the airway. As embolo/sclerotherapy agents, absolute or 80% ethanol, N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA), and various types of coils or contour particles were used in various combinations, either at the same time or in phases, depending on the location, severity, and extent of the CVM.\nThe incidence of soft tissue injury was 29.4% (42 of 143) for the arteriovenous shunting type and 8% (22 of 273) for the venous type. No soft tissue injuries occurred in the patients with arterial and lymphatic malformations. Of the 68 patients with soft tissue injury, 40 lesions healed with conservative management, and 28 lesions needed surgery, including escharectomy, skin graft, or amputation. The incidence of neuropathy was 10.9% (30 of 273) for the venous CVM. No neuropathy occurred in the patients with arterial malformations. Of the 49 patients with neuropathy, 42 recovered at a mean period of 5.3 months, but seven did not.\nSoft tissue injuries occurred in 11.9% of patients (68 of 573) and neuropathies occurred in 8.6% (49 of 573) after undergoing embolo/sclerotherapy. Most of these complications recovered by themselves (58.9% from soft tissue injury and 85.1% from neuropathy). Our results suggest that embolo/sclerotherapy has an acceptable incidence of soft tissue injury and neuropathy, when considering the effect that the CVM had on the quality of life before treatment, so embolo/sclerotherapy is recommended as a treatment modality for CVM.",

    "abstract": "Early recurrent stenosis of the cephalic arch in autogenous arteriovenous access for hemodialysis is a common problem that requires stenting to prevent thrombosis. Because the results of stenting are unsatisfactory, we compared the efficacy of stent grafts with bare stents in these patients.\nAll patients who presented with recurrent cephalic arch stenosis >50% within 3 months of successful balloon angioplasty were randomized to have angioplasty and stenting with either a bare nitinol stent or a stent graft. Outcome was assessed by angiography 3 months later. Restenosis was defined as >50% narrowing of the stent lumen or of the vessel margin up to 0.5 cm adjacent to the stent. There were no exclusions.\nThis report includes data on the outcome of 25 consecutive patients with recurrent cephalic arch stenosis who were treated from April to August 2006. At 3 months, three patients had died and one had undergone a renal transplant. The 21 patients who had angiography at 3 months had patent stents. Restenosis rates were seven of 10 (70%) in the bare stent group and two of 11 (18%) in the stent graft group (P = .024). Life-table analysis at 3 and 6 months showed that primary patency was 82% in the stent graft group and 39% in the bare stent group. One-year primary patency was 32% in the stent graft group and 0% in the bare stent group (P = .0023). During a mean follow-up of 13.7 months, nine patients died, four in the bare stent group and five in the stent graft group. Two patients in the stent graft group had received a renal transplant. The number of interventions per patient-year was 1.9 in the bare stent group and 0.9 in the stent graft group (P = .02).\nThe use of stent grafts in angioplasty for recurrent cephalic arch stenosis significantly improved short-term restenosis rates and long-term patency compared with the use of bare stents. The significant improvement that emerged during the study caused accrual of patients to be halted for ethical reasons. This study altered our usage of stents for venous stenoses in arteriovenous accesses by eliminating bare nitinol stents in favor of stent grafts.",

At 3 months, three patients had died and one had undergone a renal transplant. The 21 patients who had angiography at 3 months had patent stents. Restenosis rates were seven of 10 (70%) in the bare stent group and two of 11 (18%) in the stent graft group (P = .024). Life-table analysis at 3 and 6 months showed that primary patency was 82% in the stent graft group and 39% in the bare stent group. One-year primary patency was 32% in the stent graft group and 0% in the bare stent group (P = .0023). During a mean follow-up of 13.7 months, nine patients died, four in the bare stent group and five in the stent graft group. Two patients in the stent graft group had received a renal transplant. The number of interventions per patient-year was 1.9 in the bare stent group and 0.9 in the stent graft group (P = .02).",

    "abstract": "The management of infrarenal aortic aneurysms in high-risk patients remains a challenge. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is associated with superior short-term mortality rates but unclear long-term results and has not been shown to improve survival in patients unfit for open repair (OR). The aim of this population-based study was to evaluate the outcome after elective EVAR compared with OR in a high-risk patient cohort.\nProspectively collected data from January 2000 to December 2006 were retrieved from the Swedish Vascular Registry. The high-risk cohort was defined as age >or=60 years, American Anesthesiologists Association (ASA) class 3 or 4, and at least one cardiac, pulmonary, or renal comorbidity. These criteria were met by 217 of 1000 EVAR patients and 483 of 2831 OR patients. Primary end points were 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves for survival and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed.\nThe crude 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality rates for EVAR vs OR for the whole treatment group (n = 3831) were 1.8% vs 2.8% and 8.0% vs 7.2%, respectively. In the high-risk cohort (n = 700), EVAR patients were approximately 2 years older and renal insufficiency and diabetes mellitus were more common, and smoking was more prevalent in the OR group. About two-thirds of EVAR procedures were performed at university hospitals and one-half of OR procedures were performed at county hospitals. In the high-risk cohort, there was no difference in mortality at 30-days (EVAR, 4.6% vs OR, 3.3%), but OR had lower 1-year mortality (8.5% vs 15.9%; P = .003). More bleeding complications occurred in the EVAR group, but more pulmonary complications occurred in the OR group; however, there was no difference in cardiac, cerebrovascular, or renal complications. The mean follow-up was 3.4 years. EVAR was associated with increased mortality risk after adjusting for age, ASA class, and comorbidities (hazard ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.12; P = .02). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a lower mortality rate for patients undergoing OR, which remained during follow-up (P = .001).\nElective OR of aortic aneurysms seems to have a better outcome compared with EVAR in this specific, population-based, high-risk patient cohort after adjusting for covariates. We cannot confirm the benefit of EVAR from previous registry studies with a similar high-risk definition. In clinical practice, OR may be at least as good as EVAR in high-risk patients fit for surgery.",

    "abstract": "Significant renal artery stenosis (RAS) in a solitary functioning kidney (SFK) represents one of the most acceptable indications for renal revascularization. Percutaneous transluminal renal artery stenting (PTRAS) is increasingly being used as a first line treatment for renal revascularization, associated with renal function improvement or stabilization in the majority of the patients with solitary kidneys, but also with deterioration in up to 38% of the cases. Atheroembolism during PTRAS has been postulated as a potential cause for this acute renal function worsening. The aim of this study was to report on the feasibility, safety, and early outcomes of PTRAS in a series of patients with SFK using distal embolic protection (DEP).\nAll PTRAS procedures in SFKs performed under DEP between June 2002 and September 2007 were reviewed. Renal function, blood pressure, and the number of anti-hypertensive medications were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Renal function improvement and deterioration were defined as a 20% increase and decrease in serum creatinine, respectively, compared with preoperative values. Primary and primary assisted patency rates were also calculated. Statistical differences between values before and after intervention were determined by the Student t test and statistical significance was taken at P < .05.\nProtected PTRAS was performed in 14 patients with a SFK (9 men, 6 women, mean age 65.6 +/- 6.8 years). All patients were hypertensive and had varying degrees of azotemia. Mean pre-intervention stenosis degree was 86.8% +/- 7.8%. Immediate technical success was obtained in 100% of the patients. Renal function was cured (7.1%), improved (50%), or stabilized (42.9%) in all 14 (100%) patients after the procedure and no deterioration was noticed in any patient at 6-month follow-up. Pre- and postintervention serum creatinine levels were 3.01 +/- 1.15 mg/dL and 2.16 +/- 0.68 mg/dL, respectively, (P = .02). Hypertension was improved in 6 (42.9%) patients and stabilized in the remaining 8 (57.1%). Primary patency was 100% and 90% at 1 and 3 years, respectively, while primary assisted patency remained 100% for the whole follow-up period (mean, 31.8 +/- 19.4 months).\nThese findings suggest that in patients with a SFK, protected PTRAS represents a safe and effective treatment for halting the progression of renal dysfunction to renal loss and warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Cumulative radiation dose, cost, and increased demand for computed tomography aortography (CTA) suggest that duplex ultrasonography (DU) may be an alternative to CTA-based surveillance. We compared CTA with DU during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) follow-up.\nPatients undergoing EVAR had clinical and radiological follow-up data entered in a prospectively maintained database. For the purpose of this study, the gold standard test for endoleak detection was CTA, and an endoleak detected on DU alone was assumed to be a false positive result. DU interpretation was performed independently of CTA and vice versa.\nOne hundred thirty-two patients underwent EVAR, of whom 117 attended for follow-up ranging from six months to nine years (mean, 32 months). Adequate aneurysm sac visualisation on DU was not possible in 1.7% of patients, predominantly due to obesity. Twenty-eight endoleaks were detected in 28 patients during follow-up. Of these, 24 were initially identified on DU (four false negative DU examinations), and eight had at least one negative CTA with a positive DU prior to diagnosis. Twenty-three endoleaks were type II in nature and three of these patients had increased sac size. There was one type I and four type III endoleaks. Two of these (both type III) had an increased sac size. Of 12 patients with increased aneurysm size of 5 mm or more at follow-up, five had an endoleak visible on DU, yet negative CTA and a further five had endoleak visualisation on both DU and CTA. Of six endoleaks which underwent re-intervention, all were initially picked up on DU. One of these endoleaks was never demonstrated on CTA and a further two had at least one negative CTA prior to endoleak confirmation. Positive predictive value for DU was 45% and negative predictive value 94%. Specificity of DU for endoleak detection was 67% when compared with CTA, because of the large number of false positive DU results. Sensitivity for DU was 86%, with all clinically significant endoleaks demonstrated on CTA also detected on DU.\nDespite its low positive predictive value, we found DU to be a sensitive test for the detection of clinically significant endoleaks. Given concerns about cumulative radiation exposure and cost, and the surprisingly low sensitivity of CTA for endoleak detection in this series, selective CTA based on DU surveillance may be a more appropriate long-term strategy.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) remains the procedure of choice for treatment of patients with severe carotid artery stenosis. The role of carotid artery stenting (CAS) in this patient group is still being defined. Prior single and multicenter studies have demonstrated economic savings associated with CEA compared with CAS. The purpose of this study was to compare surgical outcomes and resource utilization associated with these two procedures at the national level in 2005, the first year in which a specific ICD-9 procedure code for CAS was available.\nAll patient discharges for carotid revascularization for the year 2005 were identified in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample based on ICD9-CM procedure codes for CEA (38.12) and CAS (00.63). The primary outcome measures of interest were in-hospital mortality and postoperative stroke; secondary outcome measures included total hospital charges and length of stay (LOS). All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 (Cary, NC), and data are weighted according to the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) design to draw national estimates. Univariate analyses of categorical variables were performed using Rao-Scott chi(2), and continuous variables were analyzed by survey weighted analysis of variance (ANOVA). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate independent predictors of postoperative stroke and mortality.\nDuring 2005, an estimated 135,701 patients underwent either CEA or CAS nationally. Overall, 91% of patients underwent CEA. The mean age overall was 71 years. Postoperative stroke rates were increased for CAS compared with CEA (1.8% vs 1.1%, P < .05), odds ratio (OR) 1.7; (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.3). Overall, mortality rates were higher for CAS compared with CEA (1.1% vs 0.57%, P < .05) this difference was substantially increased in regard to patients with symptomatic disease (4.6% vs 1.4%, P < .05). By logistic regression, CAS trended toward increased mortality, OR 1.5; (95% CI .96-2.5). Overall, the median total hospital charges for patients that underwent CAS were significantly greater than those that underwent CEA ($30,396 vs $17,658 P < .05).\nBased on a large representative sample during the year 2005, CEA was performed with significantly lower in-hospital mortality, postoperative stroke rates, and lower median total hospital charges than CAS in US hospitals. As the role for CAS becomes defined for the management of patients with carotid artery stenosis, clinical as well as economic outcomes must be continually evaluated.",

    "abstract": "To present early and midterm results after endovascular stent graft repair of patients with penetrating aortic ulcers (PAU).\nBetween January 1997 and March 2008, a total of 202 patients received thoracic aortic endografting in our institution, 48 patients (32 men, median age 70 years, range, 48-89) with PAU. A retrospective analysis of these patients was performed. Thirty-one patients (65%) showed an acute aortic syndrome (8 contained rupture, 23 symptomatic). Follow-up scheme included postoperative computed tomography angiography prior to discharge, at 3, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Mean follow-up was 31.3 months (1.3-112.6).\nTechnical success was achieved in 93.7%. Primary clinical success rate was 81.2%. In-hospital mortality was 14.6%. Perioperative mortality was significantly (P = .036) higher in patients with acute aortic syndrome compared to asymptomatic patients (22.5% vs 0%). Postoperative complications occurred in 15 patients (31%), including 2 patients with minor strokes and 6, respectively, 5 patients with cardiac and/or respiratory complications. Early endoleaks were observed in 9 patients (19%), late endoleaks in another 2 patients. Reintervention was necessary in 4 out of 48 patients (8.4%). The actuarial survival estimates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 78% +/- 6%, 74% +/- 7%, and 61% +/- 10%, respectively. There was no aortic-related death during follow-up. Cox regression showed age (hazard ratio [HR]; 1.08, P = .036) and a maximum aortic diameter >50 mm (HR, 4.92; P = .021) as independent predictors of death.\nEndovascular treatment of penetrating aortic ulcers is associated with a relevant morbidity and mortality rate in frequently highly comorbid patients. Midterm results could prove a sustained treatment success regarding actuarial survival and aortic-related death. Emergencies show a significantly worse outcome, but treatment is still warranted in these symptomatic patients.",

    "abstract": "Use of motor evoked potentials (MEP) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) monitoring during thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic surgery is controversial. This study evaluated the intraoperative use of SSEP and MEP during thoracoabdominal repair and assessed their role in decreasing the risk of spinal cord ischemia and paralysis.\nWe conducted paired SSEP and MEP monitoring to assess agreement between the methods and their ability to predict neurologic outcome in 233 patients. Changes in SSEP and MEP monitoring were classified as no change, reversible change, or irreversible change during the intraoperative period and by the conclusion of surgery. Agreement between the methods was computed using the Cohen kappa statistic. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were computed for each method on the immediate and delayed neurologic deficit.\nImmediate neurologic deficit, determined immediately upon awakening from anesthesia and confirmed by a neurologist, occurred in eight of 233 (3.4%) patients. For any change (reversible plus irreversible), agreement between MEP and SSEP was relatively low (kappa = 0.53), despite being highly statistically significant (P < .001). MEP tended to overestimate SSEP for immediate neurologic deficit, demonstrating a 53% false-positive rate, compared with a 33% false-positive rate for SSEP (specificity ratio, 1.42; P < .0001). With irreversible change, agreement between the methods was 90% (kappa = 0.896, P < .0001). Only irreversible change was significantly associated with neurologic outcome (odds ratio, 21.9; P < .00001 for SSEP; 60.8, P < .0001 for MEP), but sensitivity and positive predictive values were low (37% and 33% for SSEP; 22% and 45% for MEP, respectively). Reversible changes in neurophysiologic monitoring were not significantly associated with immediate neurologic deficit. Negative predictive values for all negative evoked potential findings were >98% for immediate deficit. No evoked potential variables were associated with delayed deficit.\nSSEP and MEP monitoring were highly correlated only when intraoperative changes were irreversible. Reversible changes were not significantly associated with immediate neurologic deficit. Irreversible changes were significantly associated with immediate neurologic deficit, and the findings were identical for SSEP and MEP in this variable, indicating that the more complex MEP measures do not add further information to that obtained from SSEP. Normal SSEP and MEP findings had a strong negative predictive value, indicating that patients without signal loss are unlikely to awake with neurologic deficit.",

    "abstract": "Postplacement cost of surveillance and secondary procedures over 5 years increases the global cost of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) by nearly 50%. This study identified and assessed the reimbursement received for long-term postplacement costs after EVAR.\nBetween December 1995 and June 2007, 360 patients underwent EVAR at a single institution. The reimbursement collected from charges of postplacement surveillance and secondary procedures related to the aneurysmal disease was evaluated and compared against the actual costs. All amounts were converted to year 2007 dollars. To minimize costs associated with the early learning curve, the initial 50 EVAR patients between December 1995 and 1998 were excluded. Patients with <1 year follow-up were also excluded. Data are expressed as mean +/- standard error.\nThe mean follow up after EVAR for 152 patients was 38.8 +/- 1.8 months. Medicare, capitated insurance, and commercial insurance provided coverage for 85 (56.0%), 49 (32.2%), and 18 (11.8%) patients, respectively. The cumulative 5-year postplacement reimbursement received per patient was $9792 meeting 81.4% of the cumulative cost of $12,027 for a net loss of $2235 per patient. Although 123 (80.9%) patients without secondary procedures generated a 5-year cumulative gain of $1830 per patient, 29 (19.1%) patients with secondary procedures averaged a 5-year cumulative loss of $9378 per patient. The average reimbursement rate over the 5-year period was 35.8% +/- 0.6%, with the lowest reimbursement rate seen in patients with Medicare at 31.6% +/- 0.7%.\nCurrent reimbursement is not sufficient to meet the costs associated with long-term surveillance and needed secondary procedures after EVAR.

    "abstract": "Postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have been reported to have more adverse outcomes after vascular reconstructions, including increased intimal hyperplasia development and bypass graft failure. HRT may be affecting the pathway contributing to intimal hyperplasia. An important component of this pathway involves matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), implicated in vascular remodeling due to their ability to degrade components of the extracellular matrix. We hypothesize that estrogen (Est) and progesterone (Prog) upregulate the MMP pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) thereby increasing MMP activity and function.\nVSMCs were incubated with Est (5 ng/mL), Prog (50 ng/mL), Est + Prog combination (Est/Prog), and/or doxycycline (40 microg/mL; Doxy). Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis we have previously shown membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels are significantly increased by Est. Here, Western blot analyses indicated MT1-MMP and MMP-2 protein levels, not tissue inhibitor of MMP-2 (TIMP-2), were increased in response to Est and Est/Prog (P < .05 vs control). In-gel zymography revealed that Est and Est/Prog resulted in increased MMP-2 activity (hormone groups, P < .05 vs control) with no significant difference among the hormone groups. VSMC migration was increased by 45 +/- 14% in response to Est (P < .05 vs control), as measured using a modified Boyden chamber assay. Doxycycline significantly inhibited basal and Est/Prog-stimulated increases in MMP-2 activity (P < .05 vs control; P < .05 vs hormone groups), and partially blocked basal and hormonally stimulated migration (P < .05 vs control and Est).\nEstrogen and progesterone affects the MMP pathway by increasing MMP-2 enzymatic activity, possibly via the upregulation of MT1-MMP expression without a corresponding increase in TIMP expression. This increased collagenase activity increases VSMC motility and their ability to migrate through a collagen type IV lattice. Est/Prog upregulation of MT1-MMP may contribute to the adverse effect of HRT on vascular interventions.",

    "abstract": "Studies report clustering of cardiovascular risk factors and increased cardiovascular events in healthy first-degree relatives (FDR) of subjects with intermittent claudication (IC). Family history is an independent risk factor in coronary artery disease but the role of genetic factors is undefined in peripheral arterial disease. The fibrin clot is the final product of the atherothrombotic process and is subject to genetic influence. We proposed that healthy male FDR of subjects with IC possess abnormalities in their fibrin clots.\nThis was a case-control family study. The FDR were recruited from claudicants attending vascular surgery out-patient clinics with the control subjects being recruited from the local primary care register. A total of 106 white European male FDR of male subjects with IC were age matched with 107 white European male control subjects from an identical geographic area. The control subjects had no FDR with a history of symptomatic cardiovascular disease, and subjects from both groups were free from a personal history of symptomatic cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus. Ex vivo assays for fibrin clot permeation, fiber thickness, factor XIII cross-linking activity, and fibrinolysis were performed on the plasma of the above subjects. In addition, linear regression analysis was undertaken to determine factors associated with clot parameters.\nFor controls and FDR, respectively, fiber thickness by turbidity was 0.75 (0.67-0.93) vs 0.86 (0.75-0.98) (P < .001), and FXIII cross-linking activity was 105% (87-141) vs 133% (103-155) (P < .001). On confocal microscopy, fibers measured 315.8 (307.0-324.6) vs 405.1 (397.6-412.6) nm (P < .001), and lysis front velocity was 12.66 (6.38-18.94) vs 4.83 (2.50-7.17), mum/min (P = .018). Linear regression analysis revealed cholesterol was associated with changes in certain clot parameters.\nThe healthy FDR of subjects with IC produce clots which have thicker fibers, increased cross-linking, and resistance to fibrinolysis when compared to controls. This supports the potential genetic basis of peripheral arterial disease and highlights that cholesterol may contribute to this abnormal structure. This suggests that the FDR of subjects with IC, an apparently healthy sub-group of the population, have an elevated cardiovascular risk associated with abnormalities in their clot structure.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare resource utilization is an understudied aspect of vascular surgery. Initial cost of a given procedure is not an accurate reflection of resource utilization because it does not account for procedural durability and efficacy. Herein we describe an amortized cost model that accounts for procedural costs, durability, and re-intervention costs.\nA cost model was developed using patency data endpoints and total hospital costs (direct and indirect) associated with an inital revascularization and subsequent re-interventions. This model was applied to a retrospective database of femoropopliteal reconstructions. One hundred and eighty-three open cases were compared with 198 endovascular cases; and the endpoints of initial cost, amortized cost at 12 months, and assisted patency were examined.\nThe open and endovascular cases were not statistically different with respect to indication, patient co-morbid profiles, or post-procedural pharmacotherapy. Primary assisted patency was better in the open revascularization group at 12 months (78% versus 66%, P < .01). There was a statistically significant higher initial cost for open reconstruction when compared with endovascular ($12,389 +/- $408 versus $6,739 +/- $206, P < .001). However, at 12 months post-procedure, the initial cost benefit was lost for endovascular patients ($229 +/- $106 versus $185 +/- $124, P = .71). There was, however, a trend for endovascular cost savings in claudicants, though this did not reach significance ($259 +/- $189 versus $86 +/- $52, P = .31). For patients with critical limb ischemia, renal dysfunction, and end stage renal disease, the trend favored open surgery.\nAn amortized cost model provides insight into the healthcare resource utilization associated with a particular revascularization and assistive procedures. The initial cost savings of endovascular therapies are not sustained over time. Cost-savings trends were noted, however, longer follow-up is required to see if these will reach statistical significance.",

There was a statistically significant higher initial cost for open reconstruction when compared with endovascular ($12,389 +/- $408 versus $6,739 +/- $206, P < .001). However, at 12 months post-procedure, the initial cost benefit was lost for endovascular patients ($229 +/- $106 versus $185 +/- $124, P = .71). There was, however, a trend for endovascular cost savings in claudicants, though this did not reach significance ($259 +/- $189 versus $86 +/- $52, P = .31). For patients with critical limb ischemia, renal dysfunction, and end stage renal disease, the trend favored open surgery.",

    "abstract": "High performance athletes, predominantly professional cyclists, can develop symptomatic arterial flow restriction in one or both legs during exercise. The ischemic symptoms are caused by endofibrosis and/or kinking of the external iliac artery. Because these athletes are young and have no classic risk factors for atherosclerosis, endofibrosis and atherosclerosis are considered different disease entities. We compared histology of endofibrotic lesions from young sportsmen with atherosclerotic lesions of the external iliac artery in elderly individuals.\nNineteen external iliac endarterectomy specimens from 18 cyclists (age 29 +/- 8 years) were compared with 42 external iliac segments from 22 elderly individuals (82 +/- 10 years). Ten arteries from elderly individuals revealed an intimal area that was >or=25% of the area encompassed by the internal elastic lamina and were considered atherosclerotic lesions. Stenosis was higher in patients (65% [interquartile range 50-75]) than in controls (11% [7-24]) (P < .0001). The endofibrotic lesions revealed loose connective tissue with moderate to high cellularity. Both in endofibrosis and atherosclerosis, most cells in the lesion were smooth muscle actin positive. In the endofibrosis specimens, loose fibers of collagen were observed, whereas in the atherosclerotic lesions collagen was mostly densely packed. Calcification of the lesion was not observed in endofibrotic lesions, whereas calcium deposition was observed in 80% of atherosclerotic lesions. Lymphocytes were present in 21% of endofibrotic lesions and in 80% of atherosclerotic cases. Macrophages were observed in 16% of endofibrotic lesions and in all atherosclerotic plaques. Luminal thrombosis was observed in one case of endofibrosis.\nIn the external iliac artery, atherosclerotic lesions and endofibrotic lesions of high performance cyclists have distinct morphologic characteristics. Endofibrosis in the external iliac artery may serve as soil for luminal thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Subjects with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an elevated prevalence of carotid stenosis and of silent myocardial ischaemia. As such, clinical guidelines advocate the detection of sub-clinical vascular disease in this population. However, the prevalence of occult vascular disease in asymptomatic patients with a low ankle-brachial index (ABI) has not been previously evaluated.\nCross-sectional study in five primary care centres for patients' selection and two University Hospitals for further assessment. Subjects were 1070 asymptomatic individuals between 60 and 80 years of age with at least two cardiovascular risk factors, selected for ankle-brachial index measurement. Eighty five subjects with an ABI <0.9 and an equal number of controls, matched for age, gender, diabetes, and smoking habit, and with a normal ABI, were referred to the Hospital for carotid ultrasound and exercise stress tests (EST). Main outcome measures were prevalence of a carotid stenosis >50% and an abnormal EST.\nThe prevalence of a low ABI in the overall population was 9.1%. A carotid stenosis >50% was detected in 14.3% of the subjects with a low ABI and in 4.7% of the control subjects (Odds Ratio [OR]: 3.37; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.04-10.93, P = .033). The prevalence of a positive EST test was 16.2% in those with a low ABI and 10.5% in control subjects (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 0.63-4.29, P = .309). These prevalences were higher in older subjects, in those with hypertension or diabetes, or in those with dyslipidemia.\nOur results indicate that in high-risk asymptomatic subjects >60 years of age, the presence of an ABI <0.9 identifies a subgroup of the population with an increased prevalence of carotid stenosis and of silent myocardial ischemia and, as such, are candidates for closer follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Remote ischemic preconditioning is a physiologic mechanism in mammalian species whereby brief exposure to nonlethal ischemia in one tissue confers protection against a prolonged ischemic insult in a distant tissue. First described almost 15 years ago, it has been slow to translate into clinical practice. Several clinical trials have recently reported that remote ischemic preconditioning reduces myocardial injury after major cardiovascular surgery. In addition, a randomized trial in patients undergoing open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair reported a significant reduction in perioperative myocardial infarctions. Remote ischemic preconditioning is easily performed and likely to prove highly cost-effective. large-scale trials of the technique are warranted in patients undergoing major vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesize that endovenous laser ablation (EVA) therapy is equally successful in improving venous insufficiency symptoms in patients with or without deep venous insufficiency (DVI).\nFrom January 2005 through August 2007, EVA of the great saphenous vein (GSV) was attempted in 364 patients (460 limbs) with symptomatic GSV reflux. The GSV was successfully cannulated and obliterated in all but 17 limbs. EVA was performed alone in 308 limbs (69.5%) and with phlebectomy or perforator ligation (EVAP) in 135 limbs (30.5%). Venous clinical severity scores (VCSS) were recorded preoperatively and at 30, 90, 180, and 360 days postoperatively. Patients were classified as those with or without DVI based on duplex imaging valve closure times at the common femoral vein (CFV) and popliteal vein (PV). In a subset of 181 patients undergoing EVA therapy in the operating room, perioperative thrombosis prophylaxis was administered based on a risk-stratification protocol. Patients were assessed with direct end points (VCSS) and indirect end points (vein occlusion rates).\nSuccessful performance of EVA led to complete saphenous vein ablation in 99.8% at 1 month and 95.9% at 1 year. Median VCSS preoperatively was 6 (interquartile range, 5-8), generally decreasing over all time points to 4 (interquartile range, 2-5) beyond 360 days (P < .001). Male gender was independently associated with greater improvement in scores with time (P = .019). Changes in VCSS and duration of vessel occlusion were equivalent regardless of DVI for both isolated EVA and EVAP. For EVAP, the true deep venous thrombosis (DVT) rate was 2.2%, whereas for isolated EVA, the rate was 0% (P = .028); the rate of saphenofemoral thrombus extension was 5.9% for EVAP vs 7.8% for isolated EVA (P = .554). The use of risk-adjusted heparin prophylaxis in patients undergoing EVAP did not have a significant effect on thrombotic complications. There were no differences in true DVT, thrombus extension, or superficial thrombophlebitis between patients with or without DVI. Performance of concomitant phlebectomy, DVI, gender, and age had no effect on the duration of vessel occlusion.\nEVA produces successful ablation and is associated with sustained improvement in VCSS. These outcomes are independent of the presence of DVI. Finally, the use of a risk-adjusted thrombosis prevention protocol had no effect on the rate of superficial thrombus extension from EVA or EVAP in patients undergoing general anesthesia.",

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing amputation of the lower limb due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are at risk of developing deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Few studies in the research literature report the incidence of DVT during the early postoperative period or the risk factors for the development of DVT in the amputation stump. This prospective study evaluated the incidence of DVT during the first 35 postoperative days in patients who had undergone amputation of the lower extremity due to PAD and its relation to comorbidities and death.\nBetween September 2004 and March 2006, 56 patients (29 men), with a mean age of 67.25 years, underwent 62 amputations, comprising 36 below knee amputations (BKA) and 26 above knee amputations (AKA). Echo-Doppler scanning was performed preoperatively and on postoperative days 7 and 31 (approximately). All patients received acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg daily) preoperatively and postoperatively, but none received prophylactic anticoagulation.\nDVT occurred in 25.8% of extremities with amputations (10 AKA and 6 BKA).

    "abstract": "To investigate whether intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) augments skin blood flow through transient suspension of local vasoregulation, the veno-arteriolar response (VAR), in healthy controls and in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nNineteen healthy limbs and twenty-two limbs with PAD were examined. To assess VAR, skin blood flow (SBF) was measured using laser Doppler fluxmetry in the horizontal and sitting positions and was defined as percentage change with postural alteration [(horizontal SBF--sitting SBF)/horizontal SBF x 100]. On IPC application to the foot, the calf, or both, SBF was measured with laser Doppler fluxmetry, the probe being attached to the pulp of the big toe.\nBaseline VAR was higher in the controls 63.8 +/- 6.4% than in patients with PAD (31.7 +/- 13.4%, P = .0162). In both groups SBF was significantly higher with IPC than at rest (P < .0001). A higher percentage increase with IPC was demonstrated in the controls (242 +/- 85% to 788 +/- 318%) than in subjects with PAD, for each one of the three different IPC modes investigated (98 +/- 33% to 275 +/- 72%) with IPC was demonstrated. The SBF enhancement with IPC correlated with VAR for all three compression modes (r = 0.58, P = .002 for calf compression, r = 0.65, P < .0001 for foot compression alone, and r = 0.64, P = .0002 for combined foot and calf compression).\nThe integrity of the veno-arteriolar response correlates with the level of skin blood flow augmentation generated with intermittent pneumatic compression, indicating that this may be associated with a transient suspension of the autoregulatory vasoconstriction both in healthy controls and in patients with PAD.",

    "abstract": "Except for compression therapy, physical therapy has scarcely been evaluated in the treatment of chronic venous disorders (CVD). Spa treatment is a popular way to administer physical therapy for CVD in France, but its efficacy has not been evaluated yet. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of balneotherapy associated with patient education, as performed in the spa resort of La L\u00e9ch\u00e8re, in patients with advanced chronic venous insufficiency (CEAP clinical classes C4/C5).\nThe study was a randomized controlled trial, spa therapy being administered on top of the usual medical care. Evaluation was by a blinded independent investigator. Subjects were patients with primary or post-thrombotic CVD with skin changes but no active ulcer (C4a, C4b, or C5), living in Grenoble area, and willing to undergo a spa treatment course in La L\u00e9ch\u00e8re. The treated group had the three week spa treatment course in La L\u00e9ch\u00e8re, soon after randomization; the control group also had a spa treatment, but starting at day 365. The treatment consisted of four balneology sessions per day, six days a week during three weeks, and three educational workshops. An independent follow-up was performed in Grenoble hospital every three months for 15 months. The main outcome criterion was the severity of the skin changes, as evaluated by means of malleolar chromametry. Quality of life, as measured by the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire 2 scale, a visual analog scale (VAS) for leg symptoms, and the occurrence of leg ulcers were used as secondary criteria. The year after spa treatment in the treated group was compared with the year before spa treatment in the control group.\nFifty-nine subjects were enrolled (29 in the treatment group and 30 in the control group). No statistically significant difference between groups was found at study onset regarding age, sex, etiology, CEAP \"C\" class, and the outcome variables. After treatment, chromametry showed significantly decreased pigmentation and erythema in the treatment group compared with the controls (P < .01). Quality of life (P < .01) and symptoms (P < .001) also improved significantly. These differences remained significant after one year follow-up. The control patients improved similarly after their own spa treatment (day 450).\nThis study shows that spa therapy, associating balneotherapy and patient education, is able to improve significantly the skin trophic changes of the CVD patients and their CVD related quality of life and symptoms. This effect is of large magnitude and remains significant one year after the treatment course.",

The objective was to determine if abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and CRP serum concentration and its CRP gene are associated.\nAAA patients and AAA negative controls were recruited. CRP concentration was measured and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3091244, assessed. AAA cases were divided into those measuring 30-55 mm and >55 mm in diameter, to assess correlation of CRP with AAA size. A total of 248 (227 male) cases and 400 (388 male) controls were included. CRP concentration was higher in cases (385.0 microl/dL [310.4-442.8] vs 180.3 microl/dL [168.1-196.9]; P < .0001). It was higher in large aneurysms (685.7 microl/dL [511.8-1083.0] vs 291.0 microl/dL [223.6-349.6]; P < .0001), with significant correlation observed to size (r = 0.37, P < .0001). CC was the most common SNP genotype with no difference in distribution (P = .43) between cases and controls. No difference existed in CRP for each genotype in the overall cohort (P = .17), cases (P = .18) and controls (P = .19).\nThe results demonstrate that CRP production may be related to the presence of AAA, especially in advanced disease.

    "abstract": "Therapeutic augmentation of collateral artery growth (ie, arteriogenesis) is of particular clinical interest for improving blood flow in vascular occlusive disease. Quantification of collateralization in small animal models is difficult, however, and the commonly used technique of laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) has always been criticized. Therefore, a new method, termed indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), was established for in vivo imaging of arteriogenesis in mice and compared with LDPI.\nUsing the accepted model of ligation of the left femoral artery of 45 C57BL6 mice, we determined arteriogenesis both by LDPI and ICGA, which were applied before and periodically after ligation of the left femoral artery (each group n = 7). Collateral artery growth within the hind limb was additionally verified by histologic workup.\nDetermination of flow by ICGA, as represented by maximal pixel intensity (ratio of left/right hind limb) demonstrated a drop from 0.97 +/- 0.06 before ligation to 0.11 +/- 0.12 directly after ligation, which recovered to 0.48 +/- 0.22 after 1 week, to 0.65 +/- 0.11 after 2 weeks, and to 0.59 +/- 0.22 after 3 weeks (n = 7, P < .05). Similarly, flow determined as the perfusion index (slope of pixel intensity, ratio left/right) dropped from 1.18 +/- 0.4 before ligation to 0.02 +/- 0.03 immediately after ligation but recovered to 0.08 +/- 0.01 after 1 week, to 0.17 +/- 0.01 after 2 weeks, and to 0.17 +/- 0.06 after 3 weeks (n = 7, P < .05). Quantification by LDPI demonstrated a drop from 1.06 +/- 0.06 (left/right ratio) before ligation to 0.37 +/- 0.03 immediately after ligation. In contrast to ICGA, perfusion recuperated completely within 1 week to 1.01 +/- 0.14 and tended to be even higher in the ligated than in the unligated hind limb after 2 (1.09 +/- 0.25) and 3 weeks (1.20 +/- 0.29), pointing towards limitations of this technique. Histologic analysis confirmed the significant increase in the number of collaterals. The intraindividual ratio increased from 1.0 +/- 0.05 before ligation to 1.35 +/- 0.10 at 2 weeks and 1.41 +/- 0.08 at 3 weeks after ligation (P < .05).\nOur data demonstrate that ICGA represents a potent tool for the quantification of collateral flow in small animal models. The current standard of LDPI seems to rather represent blood movements within the superficial skin but not of the entire hind limb.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus results in a procoagulant and thrombogenic state that could predispose diabetic individuals to develop venous thrombosis. We sought to determine whether diet-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus affects deep venous thrombosis (DVT) resolution in a murine model.\nC57Bl/6 mice were fed a low-fat or a high-fat diet (n = 10) for 10 weeks, after which DVT was created in the inferior vena cava (IVC) by a combination of low flow and endothelial damage. The IVC and thrombus were harvested at 1 and 2 weeks. Thrombus resolution and neovascularization were investigated through transfemoral angiography (n = 10), thrombus size (n = 4) and weight (n = 10), and nitric oxide synthase 3 immunoquantification (n = 4). Macrophage content was assessed by CD68 immunoreactivity (n = 4). The fibrinolytic system (urokinase plasminogen activator [uPA] and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1]) was analyzed by Western immunoblotting (n = 6) and immunohistochemistry (n = 4). Total collagen was stained by Sirius red.

    "abstract": "Conflicting data exist regarding the effect of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) on carotid endarterectomy (CEA) outcomes. A large database was used to analyze the effect of CRI, defined by glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as an independent risk factor of CEA.\nProspectively collected data regarding CEAs performed at 123 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers as part of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program were retrospectively analyzed. Renal function was used to divide patients into three CRI groups: normal or mild (control; GFR >/=60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), moderate (GFR 30 to 59), and severe (GFR <30). Bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to characterize risk factors and their associations with 30-day morbidity and mortality.\nBetween Jan 1, 1996, and Dec 31, 2003, 22,080 patients underwent CEA. Patients missing creatinine levels, already dialysis-dependent, or in acute renal failure just before surgery were excluded. This left 20,899 available for analysis, of which 13,965 had a GFR of >/=60, 6,423 had a GFR of 30 to 59, and 511 had a GFR of <30. The incidence of neurologic complications did not differ significantly (control, 1.7%; moderate CRI, 1.9%; severe CRI, 2.7%). The moderate CRI group experienced significantly more cardiac events (1.7% vs 0.9% for controls, P < .001). This remained predictive in the multivariate model even adjusting for all other risk factors (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.3; P = .009). The moderate CRI group also had higher rates of pulmonary complications (2.1% vs 1.3% control; P < .001; AOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7; P = .031) but not 30-day mortality (P = .269). Those with severe CRI had a much higher mortality (3.1% vs 1.0% control, P < .001), which remained significant in the multivariate model (AOR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.8; P < .001).\nAlthough impaired renal function does not independently increase the risk of neurologic or infectious complications, CRI is a significant negative independent risk factor in predicting other outcomes after CEA. Patients with moderate CRI (GFR, 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) are at increased risk for cardiac and pulmonary morbidity, but not death, and those with severe CRI (GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) have a much higher operative mortality. Patients with CRI should be carefully evaluated before CEA to optimize existing cardiac and pulmonary disease. Understanding this increased risk may assist the surgeon in preoperative counseling and perioperative management.",

    "abstract": "To lower the risk of complications, carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has been proposed as an alternative to open surgery for carotid artery stenosis after neck irradiation. However, there are little postoperative data to support the benefits of this strategy. This study evaluated the outcome of CAS in patients who had undergone neck irradiation.\nThis retrospective study was conducted at 15 vascular surgery or interventional radiology centers in France between January 1998 and July 2006. A total of 135 patients (115 men) with a mean age of 67 +/- 8 years (range, 43-88) underwent CAS for 149 irradiation-induced lesions. The interval between irradiation and discovery of the lesions was 12 +/- 8 years. Mean diameter reduction was 81% (range, 50%-95%), and stenosis was symptomatic in 34%. Contralateral carotid lesions were observed in 48% of patients, including thrombosis in 18 and stenosis >50% in 53.\nTechnical failure occurred during CAS in three cases. The overall technical success rate was 98%. A cerebral protection device was used in 59%. No death, one transient ischemic attack, and two strokes occurred during the first postoperative month. Mean follow-up was 30 months. Six patients were lost to follow-up. Survival rates were 93.9% at 1 year and 75.3% at 3 years. Complications after the first postoperative month included neurologic events in six, carotid thrombosis in nine, and restenosis in 18. The rates of freedom from neurologic and anatomic events were, respectively, 96.2% and 93.2% at 1 year and 93.1% and 85.9% at 3 years.\nThe immediate outcome of CAS for irradiation-induced carotid artery stenosis was satisfactory. Medium-term neurologic outcome was acceptable, but the incidence of anatomic events such as thrombosis and restenosis was high. A randomized study is needed to confirm that the outcome of the endovascular and surgical therapy is comparable in this indication.",

Two hours before surgery and 6 hours post-surgery, saline (Series I) or enoxaparin sodium (0.6 mg/kg, Series II) was administered intra-peritoneally.

The retrieved constructs underwent weight and volume measurements, and morphologic/morphometric analysis of new tissue components.\nEnoxaparin sodium treatment resulted in the development of smaller AVL constructs at 3, 10, and 21 days.

    "abstract": "The early risk of stroke after a patient suffers a transient ischemic attack (TIA)/minor stroke is significantly higher than previously thought. In most health systems, this (unfortunately) means that many vulnerable patients will have suffered their stroke before having had any chance of being considered for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid angioplasty with stenting (CAS). The problem is then compounded by institutional delays in finally undertaking CEA/CAS, which leads to even greater diminishing benefit to the patient. Notwithstanding the fact that the international trials used a 6-month threshold for inclusion, it remains an unpalatable fact that if CEA/CAS is delayed beyond 12 weeks in symptomatic patients with North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) 50% to 99% stenoses, the patient is exposed to all of the risks of intervening, but gains little in the way of long-term stroke prevention. The take-home message is, therefore, very simple; \"intervene early to prevent more strokes\". Occam's razor has never been sharper!",

    "abstract": "Although endovascular repair of thoracic aortic aneurysm has been shown to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates, spinal cord ischemia remains a persistent problem. We evaluated our experience with spinal cord protective measures using a standardized cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage protocol in patients undergoing endovascular thoracic aortic repair.\nFrom 2004 to 2006, 121 patients underwent elective (n = 52, 43%) and emergent (n = 69, 57%) endovascular thoracic aortic stent graft placement for thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) (n = 94, 78%), symptomatic penetrating ulceration (n = 11, 9%), pseudoaneurysms (n = 5, 4%) and traumatic aortic transactions (n = 11, 9%). In 2005, routine use of a CSF drainage protocol was established to minimize the risks of spinal cord ischemia. The CSF was actively drained to maintain pressures <15 mm Hg and the mean arterial blood pressures were maintained at >/=90 mm Hg. Data was prospectively collected in our vascular registry for elective and emergent endovascular thoracic aortic repair and the patients were divided into 2 groups (+CSF drainage protocol, -CSF drainage protocol). A chi(2) statistical analysis was performed and significance was assumed for P < .05.\nOf the 121 patients with thoracic stent graft placement, the mean age was 72 years, 62 (51%) were male, and 56 (46%) underwent preoperative placement of a CSF drain, while 65 (54%) did not. Both groups had similar comorbidities of coronary artery disease (24 [43%] vs 27 [41%]), hypertension (44 [79%] vs 50 [77%]), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (18 [32%] vs 22 [34%]), and chronic renal insufficiency (10 [17%] vs 12 [18%]). None of the patients with CSF drainage developed spinal cord ischemia (SCI), and 5 (8%) of the patients without CSF drainage developed SCI within 24 hours of endovascular repair (P< .05). All patients with clinical symptoms of SCI had CSF drain placement and augmentation of systemic blood pressures to >/=90 mm Hg, and 60% (3 of 5 patients) demonstrated marked clinical improvement.\nPerioperative CSF drainage with augmentation of systemic blood pressures may have a beneficial role in reducing the risk of paraplegia in patients undergoing endovascular thoracic aortic stent graft placement. However, selective CSF drainage may offer the same benefit as mandatory drainage.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous catheterization is a frequently-used technique to gain access to the central venous circulation. Inadvertent arterial puncture is often without consequence, but can lead to devastating complications if it goes unrecognized and a large-bore dilator or catheter is inserted. The present study reviews our experience with these complications and the literature to determine the safest way to manage catheter-related cervicothoracic arterial injury (CRCAI).\nWe retrospectively identified all cases of iatrogenic carotid or subclavian injury following central venous catheterization at three large institutions in Montreal. We reviewed the French and English literature published from 1980 to 2006, in PubMed, and selected studies with the following criteria: arterial misplacement of a large-caliber cannula (>/=7F), adult patients (>18 years old), description of the method for managing arterial trauma, reference population (denominator) to estimate the success rate of the therapeutic option chosen. A consensus panel of vascular surgeons, anesthetists and intensivists reviewed this information and proposed a treatment algorithm.\nThirteen patients were treated for CRCAI in participating institutions. Five of them underwent immediate catheter removal and compression, and all had severe complications resulting in major stroke and death in one patient, with the other four undergoing further intervention for a false aneurysm or massive bleeding. The remaining eight patients were treated by immediate open repair (six) or through an endovascular approach (two) for subclavian artery trauma without complications. Five articles met all our inclusion criteria, for a total of 30 patients with iatrogenic arterial cannulation: 17 were treated by immediate catheter removal and direct external pressure; eight (47%) had major complications requiring further interventions; and two died. The remaining 13 patients submitted to immediate surgical exploration, catheter removal and artery repair under direct vision, without any complications (47% vs 0%, P = .004).\nDuring central venous placement, prevention of arterial puncture and cannulation is essential to minimize serious sequelae. If arterial trauma with a large-caliber catheter occurs, prompt surgical or endovascular treatment seems to be the safest approach. The pull/pressure technique is associated with a significant risk of hematoma, airway obstruction, stroke, and false aneurysm. Endovascular treatment appears to be safe for the management of arterial injuries that are difficult to expose surgically, such as those below or behind the clavicle. After arterial repair, prompt neurological evaluation should be performed, even if it requires postponing elective intervention. Imaging is suggested to exclude arterial complications, especially if arterial trauma site was not examined and repaired.",

We report five cases and review previous reports, with a view to describing the clinical pattern, treatment options, and outcome of this infection.\nDuring a 10-year period, 21 patients were diagnosed with C fetus infection in the Department of Clinical Microbiology, five of whom had an infected arterial aneurysm. We retrospectively reviewed their medical charts. Diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical presentation, computed tomography scan, perioperative findings, and identification of C fetus in at least one blood culture or culture from an aneurysm specimen. Late outcome of surviving patients was assessed by telephone interview.\nWe identified four aortic aneurysms and one hypogastric aneurysm. All patients were seen in an emergency setting. Five had fever and abdominal pain, and three had contained rupture. Campylobacter fetus was found in blood cultures of four patients and in the aneurysm specimen of one patient. Three patients were treated by open repair and two by endovascular repair. One patient treated endovascularly died from septic shock due to C fetus at 2 weeks. One patient treated by open surgery underwent reoperation for persistent infection. The remaining patients were cured, but one died at 5 months of an unrelated cause. All surviving patients received long-term antibiotic therapy.\nCampylobacter fetus infection of aortoiliac aneurysms is a serious condition with a high rate of rupture.

    "abstract": "The performance of atherectomy devices has been variable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate our experience using the SilverHawk atherectomy (Fox Hollow Technologies, Redwood City, Calif) device for lower extremity procedures to determine predictors of midterm success.\nRecords of all patients who underwent lower extremity atherectomy with the SilverHawk atherectomy catheter were reviewed. Patient demographics, vessel treated, number of vessels treated, lesion characteristics, and postoperative courses were analyzed. Cumulative patency rates, limb salvage, mortality, and factors associated with outcomes were determined using the Kaplan-Meier Method with Cox Proportional Hazards modeling.\nBetween January 2004 and January 2006, 167 vessels were atherectomized with the SilverHawk in 73 patients. There were 42 men and 31 women treated, and the mean age was 68.8 +/- 13.8. Five patients had both legs treated for a total of 78 legs treated. Of the 78 legs intervened on, 25.6% (20/78) had 1 vessel treated, 51.3% (40/78) had 2 vessels treated, 11.5% (9/78) had 3 vessels treated, 9% (7/78) had 4 vessels treated, and 2.6% (2/78) had 5 vessels treated. A total of 78% (61/78) of patients had intermittent claudication, 71% (56/78) had rest pain, and 58% (45/78) had tissue loss. Adjunctive procedures were performed in 63 vessels in 33 patients (61 percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA] and 2 PTA + stent). Eighty-four vessels treated were totally occluded and 83 stenotic. Cumulative 1-year primary, primary assisted, secondary patency, limb salvage, and survival rates with confidence intervals, respectively, are: 43% (30,57), 49% (36,63), 57% (43,71), 75% (57,92), and 90% (80,100). Multivariable analysis demonstrated tobacco use, renal disease, diabetes, and tissue loss are all predictors of patency loss, while only diabetes and tissue loss were associated with greater limb loss. There was no difference in patency rates irrespective of location of Trans Atlantic Inter-Societal Consensus (TASC) classification, vessel treated (femoral vs tibial), or degree of stenosis (occluded vs stenotic). Also, multiple vessels treated in the same patients had no affect on patency. The mean ankle brachial index (ABI) pre-op was 0.57 +/- 0.19, and this increased to 0.81 +/- 0.21 (P < .001) at 30 days post-op.\nLower extremity atherectomy procedures with the SilverHawk device are safe and effective means in improving symptoms. However, there is decreased durability and significant patency and limb loss over time. Diabetes, renal disease, tobacco use, and tissue loss are all associated with inferior outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Endovenous chemical ablation is a technique for treatment of great saphenous vein insufficiency. However, echogenic phenomena in the right heart and high intensity transient signals detected by transcranial Doppler have been described subsequent to foam sclerotherapy. An ischemic event after foam sclerotherapy of the great saphenous vein was reported recently in a patient with an occult patent foramen ovale. Another concern is the effects of sclerosant foam on the pulmonary microvasculature.\nThis study is a retrospective report comparing the utility of three commonly used techniques for reducing sclerosant foam migration during ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy of the great saphenous vein.\nGroup 1 consisted of 20 patients treated with ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy of the great saphenous vein while lying supine, with digital pressure used to occlude the saphenofemoral junction. In group 2, 19 patients underwent injection while the leg was elevated 30 degrees , with digital pressure at the saphenofemoral junction. Group 3 comprised 19 patients injected while the leg was elevated but without manual compression at the saphenofemoral junction. All patients were monitored with subcostal echocardiography during the injection and for 3 to 5 minutes after.\nEchogenic phenomena were demonstrated in the right heart in all 20 patients in group 1, in 16 of 19 in group 2, and in nine of 19 in group 3. There was a statistically significant difference in the incidence of echogenic phenomena between groups 1 and 3 using the Fisher exact test (P < .001). A significant difference in incidence was also present when groups 2 and 3 were compared (P < .038). In groups 1 and 2, a concentrated bolus of bubbles was frequently observed after release of digital pressure; however, less intense echogenic phenomena were seen in group 3 where injection was performed with the leg elevated but without manual pressure at the saphenofemoral junction. No echogenic phenomena were observed in the left heart, and no complications occurred. Short-term treatment results were equivalent among the three groups.\nUltrasound-guided sclerotherapy of the great saphenous vein using foam sclerosants is best performed with the leg elevated and no occlusive pressure at the saphenofemoral junction in order to reduce the risk of gas embolization to the central nervous system. Further study is needed to assess the midterm success of this technique and to confirm the effect of using foam produced from physiologic gases.",

    "abstract": "The relevance of venous valves in varicose veins is still discussed controversially as, among others, the veins' wall weakness is accused to be the initial trigger of varicose veins. Thorough knowledge of their positions and frequencies will support understanding the pathogenesis of varices. Contrary to the incidences of valves in the femoral vein, no sufficient data about the positions of valves, particularly in respect to the saphenofemoral junction, are available; specifically in conjunction with the fact that terminal and preterminal valves in the great saphenous vein are missing in 10% of cases.\nThe exact positions and distances of valves in both the common femoral and the femoral vein close to the saphenofemoral junction were studied macroscopically in 32 cadavers with a total of 63 veins. Measurements were performed from the saphenofemoral junction as reference point above and below.\nValves in the common femoral vein exist in 71% of all cases with a mean distance of 3.8 cm proximally to the saphenofemoral junction. Distal valves are present in 87% of all cases with a mean distance of 5.0 cm. In more than a half, a second distal valve can be found at about 9 cm, which has not been described yet. Females have a significantly shorter mean distance of this second distal valve on the right side.\nIncorporating the study results on terminal and preterminal valves in the great saphenous vein, we have a well defined overview about the positions of the valves and frequencies in the coherent area of confluence of the superficial inguinal veins. More than ever, further studies, mainly about the real functions of valves, are necessary.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the safety and clinical and anatomic effectiveness of endovenous laser therapy (EVLT) and microphlebectomy in the treatment of varicose veins secondary to saphenous reflux.\nFrom January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2007, 1985 EVLT procedures were performed in 1559 eligible patients (1263 women) with a mean age of 52.8 years (range, 18-89 years). A 810-nm diode laser and microphlebectomy were used. All sites of superficial axial reflux above and below the knee were ablated. Symptoms of venous insufficiency were present in 97%, and 102 patients (6.54%) had an open ulcer when they underwent operation. Patients had clinical follow-up visits, including duplex ultrasound examination, at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and yearly and were assessed for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), recanalization of the ablated vein, nerve injury, ulcer healing, and resolution of symptoms.\nA total of 1652 great saphenous veins (83.22%), 285 small saphenous veins (14.36%), 40 anterolateral tributaries (2.02%), and 8 posteromedial tributaries (0.40%) were ablated. An average of 19 phlebectomies were performed per case treated (range, 1-58). The primary ablation rate at 15 and 30 months was 91.26% and 78.25% by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Recanalization occurred in 35 veins (1.76%); in this group, 15 (42.9%) exhibited symptoms of venous insufficiency and were successfully closed with a second EVLT. Body mass index >30 kg/m(2) and a vein diameter >/=8.5 mm were the only factors predictive of recanalization. Postoperatively, the 102 ulcers showed healing at a mean of 5.2 weeks (range, 2-10 weeks), and only three reopened (2.94%). No major complications occurred. Two DVT (0.13%) occurred, but no pulmonary emboli or skin burns. Local transient paresthesia at the ankle and midcalf level occurred in 38 patients (2.43%).\nEVLT of all sites of superficial axial reflux above and below the knee and microphlebectomy demonstrated that the combined approach is safe and effective at eliminating reflux, affording symptomatic relief, and healing ulcers. It offers the additional advantage of resolving varicose veins and its cause in just one visit, leading to immediate better cosmetic results.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous intervention for symptomatic renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) has replaced surgical therapy as first-line treatment. This study evaluates the factors that impact long-term anatomic and functional outcomes of endovascular therapy for symptomatic renal artery FMD.\nRecords of patients who underwent renal artery angioplasty for FMD between January 1990 and December 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. Indication for intervention was poorly controlled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg, or both, taking >2 antihypertensive medications). Twenty-nine women (average age, 45 years [range, 18-80]; 86% with a history of hypertension <8 years) underwent 38 attempted interventions. Sixty-six percent of contralateral kidneys were normal (31% had a </=60% stenosis), 13% had >60% stenosis, and the remainder were nonfunctioning or absent. Creatinine was >1.5 mg/dL in 4%, 24% had hyperlipidemia, 17% had metabolic syndrome, and 4% were considered diabetic.\nAll interventions were successfully performed. Stent placement was required in 13% for technical failure and flow-limiting dissection. Seventy-three percent of these lesions were in the proximal renal artery, with the remainder in the middle renal artery. Technical success (<30% residual stenosis) was achieved in all vessels. There were no periprocedural or 90-day deaths. The procedurally related complication rate was 8%. Median follow-up was 2 years. All patients were alive at follow-up. Primary and assisted primary patency rates were 66% and 87% at 5 years. Restenosis was considered a 50% reduction in luminal area on angiography during follow-up. The restenosis rate was 28% at 5 years (10 vessels underwent repeat percutaneous intervention). Immediate clinical benefit was seen in hypertension in 72% (improved or cured </=3 months) and was maintained in 73% at 5 years by life-table analysis. Proportional hazard analysis showed the predictors of long-term clinical benefit were duration of hypertension <8 years, creatinine <1.5 mg/dL, ipsilateral kidney size >9 cm, functional status of the contralateral kidney, a fasting blood glucose <110 mg/dL, triglycerides <150 mg/dL, and high-density lipoprotein >50 mg/dL. Neither age <50 years nor statin administration appeared significant.\nPercutaneous endovascular intervention for clinically symptomatic FMD in the renal arteries is technically successful, safe, and durable. Most patients have immediate clinical benefit, with continued long-term results out to 5 years. It appears that the presence of existing renal pathology and markers of prediabetic state are associated with recurrence of hypertensive symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Reversal of flow in the extracranial vertebral artery secondary to a proximal subclavian/innominate artery stenosis or occlusion is a frequent finding during carotid duplex ultrasonography. The characteristics of basilar artery flow are not well defined in these patients. The objective of this study is to evaluate basilar artery flow in patients with retrograde vertebral artery flow.\nFrom a transforaminal vice transforamen approach with the patient seated, pulsed Doppler scan spectral waveforms were obtained from the distal segment of each vertebral artery (depths of 66 mm and 70 mm) and throughout the basilar artery (depths of 80 mm up to 116 mm). The direction of flow and the peak flow velocity were recorded at each location. In the subset of patients with antegrade flow, we initiated a 5-minute period of arm ischemia (produced by brachial blood pressure cuff inflated to a suprasystolic pressure) and compared flow direction to baseline.\nTwenty-five patients with retrograde vertebral artery flow on carotid duplex ultrasonography underwent transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography scan of the distal vertebral arteries and the basilar artery. There were 10 males (58-85-years-old; mean 70.7 years) and 15 females (47-85-years-old; mean 66.0 years). An additional 11 patients who had normal vertebral flow underwent TCD and served as a control group. Nineteen patients (76%) demonstrated antegrade basilar artery flow at rest. Six patients (24%) demonstrated abnormal basilar artery flow at rest. Five had complete reversal of flow; one had intermittent flow reversal which became retrograde throughout the cardiac cycle following a period of arm ischemia ipsilateral to the patient's retrograde vertebral artery flow. No patient with retrograde vertebral artery flow and antegrade basilar artery flow at rest demonstrated a change in basilar artery peak velocity or direction of flow following arm ischemia.\nLess than 25% of patients with retrograde vertebral artery flow on carotid duplex ultrasonography scan demonstrated a corresponding reversal of flow in the basilar artery. The vast majority of patients do not develop flow reversal in the basilar artery. Provocative maneuvers to increase collateral flow to the arm ipsilateral to retrograde vertebral artery flow did not appear to alter basilar artery flow velocity or direction of flow. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography is indicated in patients with retrograde vertebral artery flow to document basilar artery flow, especially prior to intervention in patients with symptoms suggestive of posterior cerebral circulation insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "Previous reports have documented perioperative outcomes and major complications (renal failure, spinal cord ischemia, death) after repair of aneurysms of the thoracoabdominal aorta (TAA). This study documented long-term functional outcomes after open TAA repair.\nThe Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36-Item Survey (SF-36) was administered to 134 survivors (83 men, 51 women; mean age, 69.5 years) of TAA repair at a mean follow-up from surgery of 60 +/- 38.7 months. Raw scores were compared against cohorts adjusted for age and comorbidity (cardiovascular disease). Assessed was the influence of preoperative and intraoperative factors, as well as postoperative complications on long-term quality of life (QOL).\nRaw scores for the eight SF-36 domains and the composite physical and mental component scores were lower (P < .01) in the TAA cohort compared with an age-adjusted reference population. Female gender and age >75 years decreased the physical functioning (P = .02) and role physical (P = .04) domains compared with male gender and patients <65 years old. Previously recognized systemic vascular disease lowered QOL in three SF-36 domains: general health (P = .013), social functioning (P = .003), and role emotional (P = .003); systemic vascular disease also showed a strong trend toward reduction in physical functioning (P = .09) compared with patients without systemic vascular disease. Neither TAA extent (I to IV) nor elective vs urgent/emergency operation influenced long-term QOL in our cohort. Patients with postoperative paraplegia, cerebrovascular accident/cardiac event, and those requiring reoperation showed lower scores in the physical functioning (P = .036), general health (P = .02), and Mental Health (P = .04) domains. Increased length of stay negatively impacted long-term QOL. The TAA cohort and the cardiovascular disease cohort had similar SF-36 scores for four domains (general health, bodily pain, vitality, and social functioning) and physical component scores. The cardiovascular disease group had higher scores in the physical functioning, role physical, role emotional, and mental health domains, and in mental component scores (P < .01).\nPermanent loss of functional capacity, measured at a mean of 5 years postoperatively, occurs rarely in survivors of TAA repair. Further studies are needed to define the role of hybrid or endovascular strategies, including their impact on long-term functional outcome compared with open TAA repair.",

The TAA cohort and the cardiovascular disease cohort had similar SF-36 scores for four domains (general health, bodily pain, vitality, and social functioning) and physical component scores. The cardiovascular disease group had higher scores in the physical functioning, role physical, role emotional, and mental health domains, and in mental component scores (P < .01).",

    "abstract": "Proliferation of endovascular techniques with perceived reduction in treatment morbidity repetitively question the precept that surgical endarterectomy is the preferred treatment for occlusive disease of the common femoral artery (CFA). This study details a contemporary experience with common femoral endarterectomy (CFE) with and without concomitantly performed endovascular therapies.\nTechnical, hemodynamic, and clinical success of CFE performed between 2002 and 2005 were determined according to the Society of Vascular Surgery reporting standards. Primary and assisted patencies of the CFA segment, freedom from reintervention in the ipsilateral limb, and survival were assessed using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate factors associated with patency and survival.\nCFE was performed on 65 limbs in 58 patients (mean age 71 +/- 10; male 77%; diabetes 28%; creatinine >/= 1.5 mg/dL 19%). Forty-four cases (68%) were performed for claudication, and 21 cases (32%) for critical limb ischemia. Thirty-seven cases (57%) were performed as a hybrid procedure wherein concomitant endovascular interventions were performed. Twenty iliac (TASC II A-30%; B-35%; C-20%; D-15%) and 25 femoropopliteal (TASC II A-24%; B-60%; C-12%; D-4%) lesions were treated. Technical success was achieved in 100% of the cases. Hemodynamic success was achieved in 95% of the cases with mean postoperative increase in ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.24 +/- 0.24. All but one patient (98.5%) had improvement in symptoms and/or ABI. Average hospital stay was 3.2 days (range 1-12 days). There were 3 (5%) major complications requiring reintervention (early failure secondary to untreated inflow lesion, hematoma, and wound infection), six (9%) minor complications which were treated conservatively (five wound infections, one lymph leak), and no perioperative mortality. With a mean follow-up period of 27 months (range 1-58 months), 1- and 5-year primary patencies were 93% and 91%, respectively. Assisted patency was 100% at both time points. There was no difference in patencies between CFE performed alone or as a hybrid procedure. Multivariate analysis showed congestive heart failure (CHF) as the only predictor of primary failure (odds ratio [OR] 18.5 [2.6-142.9]; P = .004). Freedom from reintervention in the ipsilateral limb was 82% at 1 year and 78% at 5 years, with CHF again as the only predictor of reintervention (OR 5.3 [1.4-19.6]; P =.012). Survival was 89% at 1 year and 70% at 5 years. There were no amputations.\nThese data suggest CFE should remain the standard of care for occlusive disease of the CFA. Its safety and efficacy establish a standard for comparison with emerging endovascular therapies.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular stent graft repair of a traumatic thoracic aortic disruption (TTAD) is rapidly becoming an accepted alternative to open surgical repair. The use of currently approved thoracic stent grafts especially in younger patients with small, \"steep,\" tapered aortas, remains a concern due to the acute thoracic endograft collapse and enfolding. The objective of this study, the largest report to date, was to evaluate the mid-term results of TTAD treated with abdominal aortic \"stacked\" extension cuffs, with follow-up extending to 41 months.\nThirty-one patients with multi-system trauma (age range, 15 to 61; mean 31.4 years) were seen after motor vehicle accidents between January 1, 2003 and July 1, 2007. Chest x-ray findings warranted thoracic CT scans, which revealed disruptions of the thoracic aorta. Intra-operative arteriograms in all patients and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) (n = 17) delineated the extent of the aortic injuries. The aortic length from the subclavian artery to the injury averaged 2.5 cm (range, 1.5 to 4.0 cm). The repairs were performed with Gore (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) (n = 15), Aneuryx (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif) (n = 15), and Zenith (Cook, Inc., Bloomington, Ind) (n = 1) Aortic Extension Cuffs. A femoral artery approach was used in 27 patients and a supra-inguinal retroperitoneal iliac approach in four. All patients underwent thoracic CT scans during follow-up.\nIn all patients, the stent-graft cuffs successfully excluded the TTAD: 21 patients had 2 cuffs, 9 had 3 cuffs, and 1 had 4 cuffs. The aorta adjacent to the injury mean diameter was 18.5 mm (range, 17-24 mm). No subclavian arteries were covered. Two patients required an additional cuff for exclusion of the Type I endoleaks at the distal attachment site within 6 weeks of initial endograft repair. There were no procedure-related deaths; 2 patients died of other injuries. At follow-up, extending to 41 months (range, 3 to 41 months), two pseudo-aneurysms occurred which required open operative repair: 1 due to infection (4 months) and a leaking pseudoaneurysm (14 months). A CT scan in all other survivors demonstrated no device-related complications, endoleaks, or cuff migrations.\nStent-graft repair of TTAD is technically feasible. The technique of \"stacked\" aortic cuffs provides an acceptable option when urgent therapy is needed, when patients are deemed high-risk for open operative repair, or until thoracic endografts are designed which can safely treat focal, smaller aortic diameter injuries.",

    "abstract": "Lower extremity chronic venous disease is due to venous hypertension resulting from reflux and/or obstruction. Studies of venous valvular function have validated and quantified valve closure times defining normal and abnormal valve function, and investigators have categorized the amount of venous reflux with validated criteria. However, hemodynamics of venous outflow obstruction remains poorly defined. The purpose of this study is to assess whether chronic venous disease alters arterial inflow at rest or during hyperemic limb challenge, and whether there are differences in patients with primary chronic venous insufficiency (1 degrees CVI) versus those with postthrombotic venous disease.\nTwenty-two normal limbs and 32 limbs in patients with chronic venous disease (C-3 or greater) were examined between September 2006 and January 2008. Chronic venous disease patients consisted of 22 postthrombotic patients and 10 with 1 degrees CVI. Arterial inflow was measured at rest using venous occlusion plethysmography and after induced arterial inflow using postocclusive reactive hyperemia (PORH). Volume changes were recorded with volume plethysmography. A minimum of 10 minutes elapsed between the resting and PORH measurements of arterial inflow.\nResting arterial inflow was greater in patients with 1 degrees CVI when compared to normal patients (2.81 vs 1.26, P = .008) and to patients with postthrombotic venous disease (2.81 vs 1.13, P = .03). There was a 7.3-fold increase in maximal arterial inflow in normal patients during PORH versus a 4.8-fold increase in patients with postthrombotic venous disease (P = .015). Patients with 1 degrees CVI had a marked attenuation of maximal arterial inflow during hyperemic limb challenge, demonstrating only a twofold increase relative to their baseline resting arterial inflow (P = .08).\nIncreases in arterial inflow during a hyperemic limb challenge are less robust in patients with postthrombotic venous disease than in normal volunteers. These data suggest that the pain of venous claudication may in part be due to a diminished arterial inflow response.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze outcomes of surgical management for popliteal artery aneurysms (PAA).\nThis is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data regarding operations for PAA obtained from 123 United States Veterans Affairs Medical Centers as part of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression were used to characterize 33 risk factors and their associations with 30-day morbidity and mortality. Survival and amputation rates, observed at one and two years after surgery, were subject to life-table and Cox regression analyses.\nThere were 583 operations for PAA in 537 patients during 1994-2005. Almost all were in men (99.8%) and median age was 69 years (range, 34 to 92 years). Most had multiple co-morbidities, 88% were ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) class 3 or 4, and 81% were current or past smokers (median pack-years = 50). Only 16% were diabetic. Serious complications occurred in 69 (11.8%) cases, of which 37 (6.3%) required arterial-specific reinterventions. Eight patients died within 30 days, a mortality of 1.4%. Risk factors associated with increased complications included: African-American race (odds ratio [OR] 2.8 [95% confidence interval 1.5-5.2], P = .002), emergency surgery (OR 3.8 [2.0-7.0], P < .0001), ASA 4 (OR 1.9 [1.1-3.5], P = .04), dependent functional status (OR 2.5 [1.4-4.7], P = .004), steroid use (OR 3.2 [1.2-8.7], P = .03), and need for intraoperative red blood cell transfusion of any quantity (OR 6.3 [3.5-11.2], P < .0001). Independent predictors for complications in the multivariate model were dependent functional status (adjusted OR 2.1 [1.1-4.3], P = .049) and intraoperative transfusion (adjusted OR 4.5 [2.3-8.9], P = .0002). Postoperative bleeding complications within 72 hours independently predicted early amputation (adjusted OR 25.5 [1.7-393], P = .02). Unadjusted patient survival was 92.6% at one year and 86.1% at two years. Limb salvage in surviving patients was 99.0% at 30 days, 97.6% at one year, and 96.2% at two years. Dependent preoperative functional status was the only factor predictive of worse two-year limb salvage (adjusted OR 4.6 [1.9-10.9], P = .001), but remained high at 88.2% versus 97.1% in independent patients.\nSurgical intervention for PAA is associated with low operative mortality and offers excellent two-year limb salvage, even in high-risk patients. Patients' preoperative functional status and perioperative blood transfusion requirements were the most predictive indicators of negative outcomes.",

    "results": "There were 583 operations for PAA in 537 patients during 1994-2005. Almost all were in men (99.8%) and median age was 69 years (range, 34 to 92 years). Most had multiple co-morbidities, 88% were ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) class 3 or 4, and 81% were current or past smokers (median pack-years = 50). Only 16% were diabetic. Serious complications occurred in 69 (11.8%) cases, of which 37 (6.3%) required arterial-specific reinterventions. Eight patients died within 30 days, a mortality of 1.4%. Risk factors associated with increased complications included: African-American race (odds ratio [OR] 2.8 [95% confidence interval 1.5-5.2], P = .002), emergency surgery (OR 3.8 [2.0-7.0], P < .0001), ASA 4 (OR 1.9 [1.1-3.5], P = .04), dependent functional status (OR 2.5 [1.4-4.7], P = .004), steroid use (OR 3.2 [1.2-8.7], P = .03), and need for intraoperative red blood cell transfusion of any quantity (OR 6.3 [3.5-11.2], P < .0001). Independent predictors for complications in the multivariate model were dependent functional status (adjusted OR 2.1 [1.1-4.3], P = .049) and intraoperative transfusion (adjusted OR 4.5 [2.3-8.9], P = .0002). Postoperative bleeding complications within 72 hours independently predicted early amputation (adjusted OR 25.5 [1.7-393], P = .02). Unadjusted patient survival was 92.6% at one year and 86.1% at two years. Limb salvage in surviving patients was 99.0% at 30 days, 97.6% at one year, and 96.2% at two years. Dependent preoperative functional status was the only factor predictive of worse two-year limb salvage (adjusted OR 4.6 [1.9-10.9], P = .001), but remained high at 88.2% versus 97.1% in independent patients.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a prevalent health condition affecting up to 14% of men and 6% of women. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) compared with open surgical repair (OSR) in patients at a high risk of surgical complications.\nPatient-level cost and outcome data from a 1-year prospective observational study conducted at London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, Canada, was used to determine the incremental cost per life-year gained and the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of EVAR compared with OSR in patients with an AAA >5.5 cm and a high risk of surgical complications. The analysis was taken from a societal perspective and the time horizon was 1 year. To measure sampling uncertainty on costs and effects, nonparametric bootstrap techniques were applied. Uncertainty results were expressed using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Extrapolations of the 1-year results to a 5-year time horizon were conducted in sensitivity analyses.\nBetween August 11, 2003, and April 3, 2005, 192 patients at a high risk of surgical complications were enrolled: 140 received EVAR and 52 OSR. Point estimates during a 1-year period showed that EVAR dominated OSR for high-risk patients in terms of incremental cost per life-year gained and incremental cost per QALYs. However, bootstrap estimates for the two cost-effectiveness measures indicated there was a great deal of uncertainty regarding the costs and the QALYs and less uncertainty regarding life-years gained. If society was willing to pay $50,000 per life-year gained or per QALY gained, the probability of EVAR being cost-effective was found to be 0.76 and 0.55, respectively. Five-year extrapolations indicated that EVAR was cost-effective compared with OSR.\nAccording to this 1-year observational study, EVAR may be a cost-effective strategy compared with OSR for high-risk patients. Longer-term data are needed to decrease the uncertainty associated with the results.",

    "abstract": "The Hardman index, which has five variables, has been recommended as a predictor of outcome after open repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAAs). It has been reported that the presence of three or more variables is uniformly fatal. The aim of this study was to test the same model in an independent series of RAAA patients undergoing endovascular repair.\nA consecutive series of 41 patients undergoing endovascular repair for RAAA during an 8-year period was analyzed retrospectively. Thirty-day mortality and patient variables, including the five Hardman risk factors of age >76 years, serum creatinine >190 micromol/L, hemoglobin <9 g/dL, loss of consciousness, and electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of ischemia, were recorded. The Hardman index and a revised version of the index with four variables (without ECG ischemia) were calculated and related to clinical outcome.\nOperative mortality was 41% (17 of 41). On univariate analysis, only age >76 years (P = .01) and the use of local anesthesia (P < .0001) were statistically significant. Loss of consciousness (P = .05) showed a trend toward a higher mortality, albeit not statistically significant. On multivariate analysis, the use of local anesthesia was the only significant predictor of survival (odds ratio [OR], 0.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.003-0.25, P = .001). Again, loss of consciousness showed an association with a higher chance of dying but did not achieve statistical significance (OR, 6.30; 95% CI, 0.93-42.51, P = .059). The original and revised versions of the Hardman index were both significantly associated with death (P = .02 and P = .001, chi(2) test for trend). The cumulative effect of 0, 1, 2, and >/=3 risk factors on mortality was 0%, 27%, 36%, and 71% for the original index, and 12.5%, 21%, 60%, and 78% for the revised version, respectively. Four and two patients with a score of >/=3 in each version of the index survived endovascular repair.\nThe Hardman index, with or without incorporating ECG ischemia, seems to be a simple and useful predictive tool in patients undergoing endovascular repair of RAAA, with the mortality rate increasing along with the Hardman score. However, the index cannot be used to accurately identify patients with no chance of survival after endovascular repair.",

    "abstract": "Large variations in the intervention rates for ruptured and nonruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) over time have been reported, both decreasing and increasing numbers. Women have been reported to constitute an increasing proportion of patients treated for several manifestations of cardiovascular disease; whether a similar trend is true for AAA is not well understood. This study investigated recent temporal trends in a complete national register regarding the number and type of procedure performed for AAA, and outcome, with special emphasis on gender differences.\nData for all individuals treated for nonruptured or ruptured AAA in Sweden (1990 to 2005) were obtained from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (NBHW). A total of 14369 individuals were identified; 2327 (16%) were women. Date and type of intervention, date and cause of death, age, and sex were included in the statistical model.\nThere was a relative annual increase in interventions for nonruptured AAA; 4% for women (P < .0001) and 2% for men (P < .0001). No significant trends were observed for interventions for rupture during the observation period. No significant increase in the proportion of women was recorded for nonrupture (17%) or rupture (15%). Women had higher crude 30-day mortality rate than men after treatment for both nonruptured (5.7% vs 4.9%) and ruptured (41.9% vs 36.8%) AAA. In a logistic regression model, survival improved over time after intervention for nonrupture (P < .0001) and rupture (P < .0001). Increasing age (P < .0001 for both nonrupture and rupture) but not sex (P = .49 for non rupture and P = .42 for rupture) had a negative influence on mortality.\nInterventions for nonruptured but not for ruptured AAA increased over time, with an expected rapid increase of endovascular repair in the nonruptured group. The unchanged fraction of women over time possibly reflects the true distribution of AAA between the sexes. The outcome after treatment for both nonruptured and ruptured AAA improved, as anticipated, over time. No increase in mortality among women was recorded after adjustment for age.",

    "abstract": "Great saphenous vein (GSV) reflux is the most frequent form of venous insufficiency in symptomatic patients and is commonly responsible for varicose veins of the lower extremity. This non-randomized prospective controlled study was designed to test the hypothesis that 1) endovenous laser treatment is more effective than foam sclerotherapy in the closure of the refluxing GSV (as measured by degree of great saphenous vein reflux and venous clinical severity score changes) and 2) to record the associated complications of echo-guided endovenous chemical ablation with foam and endovenous laser therapy for the treatment of great saphenous vein reflux and to further identify risk factors associated with treatment failure.\nBetween January 1, 2006 and June 25, 2006, patients seeking treatment of varicose veins at a private practice of vascular medicine were assessed for the study. Inclusion criteria were: 1) presence of great saphenous vein reflux and 2) C2-6, Epr, A s, according to the CEAP classification. The selected patients consented into the study and were allowed to choose between foam (53 patients) or laser (45 patients) treatment. Duplex examinations were performed prior to treatment and at seven and 14 days, four weeks, six months, and one year after treatment. Venous clinical severity score was assessed pre-treatment and at one year post-procedure.\nThe cohorts showed no statistically significant differences in age, sex, clinical and anatomical presentation, great saphenous vein diameter, and venous clinical severity score before the treatments. After one year follow up, occlusion of the great saphenous vein was confirmed in 93.4% (42/45) of limbs studied in the laser group and 77.4% (41/53) of limbs in the foam group (P < .0465). Venous clinical severity score significantly improved in both groups (P < .0001). Procedure associated pain was higher in the laser group (P < .0082). Induration, phlebitis, and ecchymosis were the most common complications. Logistical regression and subgroups analysis shown that a larger great saphenous vein diameter measured before treatment was associated with treatment failure in the foam (odds ratio 1.68, 95% CI 1.24-2.27, P < .0008) and in the laser group (odds ratio 1.91, 95% CI 1.02-3.59, P < .0428). A 90% treatment success is predicted for veins <6.5 mm in the foam group versus veins <12 mm in the laser group.\nOverall, endovenous laser ablation achieved higher occlusion rates than echo-guided chemical ablation with foam after one year follow-up. Matching the patient to the technique based on great saphenous vein diameter measured before treatment may assist in boosting the treatment success rate to >90%. A larger patient cohort followed and compared over a longer period of time would be required to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the effect of long-term anticoagulant treatment (enoxaparin vs coumarin) in patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) as to incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and recurrent venous thromboembolism. We also analyzed the impact of thrombus regression after the anticoagulant treatment for these two outcomes.\nA prospective study was designed in which 165 patients with symptomatic, unilateral, first-episode DVT were randomized to a long-term anticoagulant treatment with coumarin or enoxaparin during at least 3 months. The rate of thrombus regression was defined as the difference in Marder score after 3 months of treatment by venography. Follow-up was performed at 3, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter for 5 years. Venous disease was related to pathologic severity of PTS according to the validated scale of Villalta as rated by a physician blinded to treatment. Recurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism was documented objectively.\nThe 5-year follow-up period was completed for 100 patients (enoxaparin, 56; coumarin, 44). A lesser incidence of PTS was observed in the enoxaparin group (39.3% absent, 19.6% severe) than in the coumarin group (29.5% absent, 29.5% severe), although this difference was not statistically significant. The accumulated recurrence rate was 19.3% with enoxaparin compared with 36.6% with coumarin (P = .02). Although the mean Marder score was significantly improved in both groups (49.1% for enoxaparin vs 24.0% for coumarin; P = .016), a lower reduction in thrombus size was associated with higher clinical events of recurrence (hazard ratio = 1.97; 95% CI, 1.06-3.66; P = .032). A significant inverse correlation was also found between the degree of thrombus regression at 3 months and the incidence at 5 years of PTS (P = .007).\nResidual venous thrombosis is an important risk factor for recurrent thromboembolism and PTS. A greater reduction in thrombus size was associated with lesser clinical events of recurrence and consequently a lesser rate of PTS. However, despite a greater recanalization with enoxaparin, the incidence of PTS was similar between both treatment groups, probably because of the small sample size. Further investigations are needed to clarify the implication of the anticoagulant treatment in the severity of PTS.",

    "abstract": "The distal revascularization and interval ligation (DRIL) procedure has evolved as the optimal treatment for access-related hand ischemia despite concerns about its durability. This study was designed to review our institutional experience and objectively define its mid-term outcome.\nA retrospective review of all patients undergoing the DRIL procedure was performed. The diagnosis of severe hand ischemia was made based primarily upon clinical presentation, but confirmed with noninvasive imaging in select cases. The DRIL conduit was selected based upon noninvasive imaging (vein conduit criteria: saphenous > arm; diameter >/=3 mm) and the proximal anastomosis was positioned >/=7 cm from the access anastomosis. The DRIL bypasses were followed in a graft surveillance protocol and remedial procedures performed as dictated by clinical or ultrasound scan findings.\nSixty-four DRIL procedures were performed in 61 patients (age - 58 +/- 13 standard deviation [SD], female - 62%, diabetic - 72%). The index access procedures included: autogenous brachiocephalic - 46%, autogenous brachiobasilic - 31%, autogenous brachioaxillary translocated femoral vein - 20%, other -3%. The precipitating symptoms were pain (25%), paresthesia (34%), motor dysfunction (24%), and tissue loss (17%); a pre-emptive DRIL was performed in 5 patients. The timing of the DRIL relative to the index access was dictated by the symptoms: <24 hrs - 19%; 1 day </= DRIL </=7 days - 29%; 7 days </= DRIL </=30 days - 8%; >30 days - 44%. Perioperative mortality rate was 3% and the complication rate was 22% (wound - 14%). The DRIL procedure relieved the ischemic symptoms in 78% of the cases (residual symptoms: paresthesia - 13%; pain - 5%; tissue loss - 4%; motor - 2%). The DRIL also resulted in significant (P < .05) increases in both the wrist/brachial index (WBI) and digital/brachial index (DBI) with the mean increases of 0.34 +/- 0.26 and 0.41 +/- 0.21, respectively. The primary DRIL patency rates (+/- standard error of the mean [SEM]) were 77 +/- 8%, 74 +/- 9%, and 71 +/- 9% at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years, respectively, while the corresponding secondary patency rates were 81 +/- 7%, 76 +/- 9%, and 76 +/- 9%, and the survival rates were 71 +/- 6%, 59 +/- 7%, and 33 +/- 9%. The index access procedure went on to mature sufficiently for cannulation in 68% of the cases when the DRIL was performed early (ie, <3 months from index access); all accesses functional at the time of the DRIL were used for dialysis throughout the perioperative period.\nThe DRIL procedure safely and effectively relieves the symptoms of severe access-related hand ischemia while preserving the access. The midterm results suggest that the DRIL bypasses are durable, although long-term graft surveillance may be justified given the observed failures.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the influence of placement of the bifurcated Powerlink endograft (Endologix Inc, Irvine, Calif) on the aortic bifurcation, with the addition of a proximal extension, in the endovascular treatment (EVAR) of selected patients with atherosclerotic abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).\nFrom September 1999 to June 2007, 205 patients were treated with the bifurcated Powerlink endograft for atherosclerotic AAA at two Italian centers with shared protocols. Patients were retrospectively divided in two groups according to treatment with the bifurcated graft only (n = 126), or its placement on the bifurcation with the addition of a proximal extension (n = 79) at the initial procedure. Study end points included postoperative complications, secondary procedures, immediate and late conversion, migration, endoleak, death, and aneurysmal sac behavior.\nOverall technical success was 98.5%. Additional procedures were performed in 18%, and postoperative complications occurred in 11.2% (systemic, 8.3%; local, 2.9%). Median follow-up was 42.4 months (range, 6-94 months). Secondary procedures were recorded in 11.2%, migration in 3.9%, type I proximal endoleak in 7.8%, and late conversions in 2.4%. Placement on the bifurcation and the addition of an extension were associated with a higher incidence of postoperative complications (7.1% vs 17.7%, P = .020). A reduced incidence of endoleak (19% vs 8.9%, P = .048), secondary procedures (14.3% vs 6.3%, P = .04), and migration (6.3% vs 0%, P = .024) were observed in the group with a proximal extension. Analysis of single variables reveals that migration was significantly influenced by placement of the graft on the bifurcation (47% vs 0%, P < .001). Both placement on the bifurcation and the addition of an extension positively influenced the type I proximal endoleak rate (3.8% vs 35.3% P < .001) and the need for a secondary intervention (6.3% vs 35.3% P < .001) Two aneurysm ruptures and five cases of late conversion occurred in the group treated with a bifurcated graft only (4%, P = .52, P = .159). Analysis of aneurysm sac behavior was not statistically significant: enlargement, 4.1% vs 1.3% (P = .158); reduction, 34.1% vs 40.5% (P = .542).\nThe placement of the bifurcated Powerlink endograft on the aortic bifurcation with a proximal extension for complete sealing seems to improve late outcomes, particularly secondary procedures, migration, and endoleak development. Larger prospective studies with longer follow-up are necessary to confirm these promising results.",

Median follow-up was 42.4 months (range, 6-94 months). Secondary procedures were recorded in 11.2%, migration in 3.9%, type I proximal endoleak in 7.8%, and late conversions in 2.4%. Placement on the bifurcation and the addition of an extension were associated with a higher incidence of postoperative complications (7.1% vs 17.7%, P = .020). A reduced incidence of endoleak (19% vs 8.9%, P = .048), secondary procedures (14.3% vs 6.3%, P = .04), and migration (6.3% vs 0%, P = .024) were observed in the group with a proximal extension. Analysis of single variables reveals that migration was significantly influenced by placement of the graft on the bifurcation (47% vs 0%, P < .001). Both placement on the bifurcation and the addition of an extension positively influenced the type I proximal endoleak rate (3.8% vs 35.3% P < .001) and the need for a secondary intervention (6.3% vs 35.3% P < .001) Two aneurysm ruptures and five cases of late conversion occurred in the group treated with a bifurcated graft only (4%, P = .52, P = .159). Analysis of aneurysm sac behavior was not statistically significant: enlargement, 4.1% vs 1.3% (P = .158); reduction, 34.1% vs 40.5% (P = .542).",

    "abstract": "The treatment of patients with chronic arterial occlusions involving the superficial femoral artery has changed significantly with the incorporation of subintimal angioplasty (SIA) into vascular surgery practice. To more clearly define technical feasibility, patency, and clinical outcomes of SIA, we reviewed our cumulative experience.\nA retrospective review of all patients who underwent SIA of arterial occlusions originating in the superficial femoral artery was performed. Patient history, demographics, procedural details, and follow-up information were collected and analyzed. Patency, limb salvage, sustained improvement in claudication, freedom from surgical bypass, and survival were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis.\nFrom December, 2002, through July, 2006, 506 infrainguinal SIA procedures were performed in 472 patients with chronic arterial occlusion involving the superficial femoral artery. The mean age of patients treated was 69.4 +/- 11.9 years and the indication for intervention was critical limb ischemia in 63% of limbs (n = 317) and disabling claudication in 37% (n = 189). Forty-seven percent of limbs (n = 237) had isolated SFA occlusions, 40% (n = 205) had femoropopliteal occlusions, and 13% of limbs had occlusions beginning in the SFA and extending into the tibial arteries (n = 64). Technical success was achieved in 87% of procedures. Following successful SIA, the mean ankle-brachial index increased by 54%, from 0.50 +/- 0.16 to 0.77 +/- 0.23 (P < .0001). Median follow-up was 12.4 months (0-48 months) and 30-day mortality was 0.8%. Primary patency at 12 and 36 months was 45% (SE 3.0%) and 25% (SE 3.6%) respectively. Secondary patency was 76% (SE 2.6%) and 50% (SE 4.8%) at 12 and 36 months. Factors associated with reduced primary patency included femorotibial occlusions (HR 1.57, CI 1.05-2.36) and the presence of critical limb ischemia (HR 1.39, CI 1.02-1.89). Limb salvage in patients with critical limb ischemia was 75% (SE 5.9%) at 36 months. Freedom from surgical bypass in patients with either critical limb ischemia or disabling claudication was 77% (SE 4.1%) at 36 months.\nSIA is an effective percutaneous technique for the revascularization of patients with lower extremity chronic arterial occlusions involving the superficial femoral artery. The procedure is successfully performed in all segments of the lower extremity with minimal morbidity or mortality. Rates of limb salvage and improvement in claudication are similar to those achieved by open surgical bypass, while modest reductions in limb salvage and primary patency are experienced in limbs with femorotibial occlusions.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia and infarction after surgery remain leading causes of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing major vascular surgery. B-type natriuretic peptide has been shown to predict early postoperative cardiac events in patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery. We aimed to determine if N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), with its longer half-life and greater plasma stability, can predict postoperative myocardial injury in vascular patients.\nRecruited were 136 patients undergoing elective surgery for subcritical limb ischemia or abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Plasma NT-pro-BNP was measured preoperatively, and troponin-I was measured immediately after surgery and on postoperative days 1, 2, 3, and 5.\nTwenty-eight patients (20%) sustained postoperative myocardial injury (troponin-I rise of >0.1 ng/mL). The median NT-pro-BNP level of those with myocardial injury was significantly higher than those who did not (380 pg/mL [interquartile range (IQR), 223-967] vs 209 pg/mL [109-363]; P = .003). NT-pro-BNP predicted this outcome with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 68% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56%-0.78%). In a multivariate analysis, a NT-pro-BNP value of >/=308 pg/mL (the optimal ROC curve-derived cutoff) was associated with an increased incidence of myocardial injury (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.41-9.09, P =.01).\nElevated preoperative plasma NT-pro-BNP levels independently predict postoperative myocardial injury, which is associated with adverse outcome in the short- and long-term regardless of the presence of symptoms of acute coronary syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Traditional recommendations for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) risk factor reduction include smoking cessation, low-fat/low-salt diet, exercise, and optimal medical management of chronic disease. Little attention has been paid to the role of dietary supplementation of specific nutrients in the prevention of PAD.\nThis cross-sectional study used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to determine specific nutrients that are associated with prevalent PAD in the United States (US) population. NHANES data include nationwide sampling of the US population, using physical examination, questionnaire, and laboratory testing. PAD status was defined by an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of <0.9. Nutritional information was collected by 24-hour dietary recall using the US Department of Agriculture dietary collection instrument. Data were linked to a database of foods and their nutrient composition. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate associations between specific nutrient intake and the presence of PAD. Multivariate models adjusted for the effects of age, gender, hypertension, coronary vascular disease, diabetes, and smoking.\nNHANES data for 1999 to 2004 included 7203 lower extremity examinations, of which 422 individuals had prevalent PAD (5.9%). Examinees with PAD had significantly higher rates of hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and smoking than those without PAD. Univariate analysis revealed that consumption of all nutrients considered were associated with lower odds of PAD, including antioxidants (vitamins A, C, and E), folate, other B vitamins (B(6), B(12)), fiber, and polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids. After adjustment for traditional risk factors, nutrients associated with reduced prevalence of PAD were vitamin A (odds ratio [OR], 0.79; P = .036), vitamin C (OR, 0.84; P < .001), vitamin E (OR, 0.78; P = .011), vitamin B(6) (OR, 0.71; P = .023), fiber (OR, 0.65; P < .001), folate (OR, 0.67; P = .006), and omega-3 (alpha-linolenic) fatty acid (OR, 0.79; P = .028).\nImproved nutrition is associated with a reduced prevalence of PAD in the US population. Higher consumption of specific nutrients, including antioxidants (vitamin A, C, and E), vitamin B(6), fiber, folate, and omega-3 fatty acids have a significant protective effect, irrespective of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. These findings suggest specific dietary supplementation may afford additional protection, above traditional risk factor modification, for the prevention of PAD.",

Selective medullary arteriography is indispensable for diagnosis and can demonstrate three signs: an anterior spinal dorsolumbar artery (artery of Adamkiewicz) that does not descend to the conus medullaris; posterior spinal arteries arising from the second lumbar arteries that vascularize the conus medullaris; existence of a tight stenosis on the second right lumbar artery that is aggravated during dynamic maneuvers.

    "abstract": "To evaluate national outcomes after open repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (DTA).\nThe DTA repairs were identified from the NIS database from 1988-2003 by ICD9 codes for thoracic vascular resection and replacement (38.45) and a diagnosis of intact (441.1) or ruptured (441.2) thoracic aortic aneurysm; excluding thoraco-abdominal aneurysm, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, cardioplegia, hypothermia, cardiac surgery, or aorta to carotid or subclavian bypass. Demographics and comorbidities were noted. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and complications. Annual hospital surgical volume terciles (high, medium, and low) were quantified for the series and patients assigned accordingly. Outcomes were compared between intact and ruptured aneurysm characteristics as well as annual hospital volume. Predictors of peri-operative mortality were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression.\nA total of 2549 DTA repairs were identified (1976 intact, 573 ruptured). Mortality was 18% overall; 10% for intact (age <65 6.2%, 65-74 11.3%, >/=75 17.6%, P < .001), 45% for ruptured (age <65 33.3%, 65-74 47.1%, >/=75 52.4%, P < .001). Mortality decreased over the 15-year time-period (P < .0001). Mortality after intact repair was lower at a high volume hospital (HVH) (8%) than a low volume hospital (LVH) (13%) or medium volume hospital (MVH) (12%). Hospital volume tercile did not predict rupture mortality. Complications after intact DTA repair were coded in 42%; including respiratory (13%), cardiac (11%), acute renal failure (8%), stroke (3%), and neurologic (non-stroke) (2%). Complications were coded in 49% after ruptured DTA repair including respiratory (13%), cardiac (13%), acute renal failure (20%), stroke (3%), and neuro (non-stroke) (2%). Predictors of mortality (for all DTA repairs) were (odd ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [CI]): age 65-74 vs age <65 (1.8, 1.4-2.4), age >/=75 vs age <65 (2.7, 2.0-3.6), rupture (6.3, 5.1-7.9), and LVH or MVH vs HVH (1.3, 1.1-1.7).\nMortality after open repair of DTA is high and complications are common. Mortality is dependent upon age, rupture status, and hospital surgical volume. Results of endovascular DTA repair should be compared using similar population-based data.",

    "abstract": "An adenoviral vector carrying a recombinant tropoelastin (TE) gene with a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) tag adenoviral tropoelastin green fluorescent protein (AdTE-GFP) was transferred to aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) for studying the expression of recombinant elastin in vitro and the reconstruction of elastic fibers in vivo in experimental abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nThe AAAs were induced in rats by perfusing the arteries with porcine pancreatic elastase, and after AAA formation, adenoviral vectors were perfused directly into the aneurysmal lumen. VSMCs transfected with AdTE-GFP in vitro and in vivo were detected by fluorescence microscopy. The TE mRNA levels and the level of recombinant elastin expression of AdTE-GFP transfected VSMCs in vitro (at 1, 3, and 5 days) and in vivo (at 2 and 4 weeks) were compared by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. The aortic diameters (AD) of the aneurysms were measured at three time points (immediately, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks post-perfusion) and comparisons were made among the AdTE-GFP transfected group, an empty adenovirus (AdNull) transfected group, and a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) perfused group. Formation of new elastic fibers in vivo was assessed by histologic analysis.\nAdTE-GFP transfection reversed AAA formation (mean +/- standard error), with the controls showing increased ADs (a 48.50 +/- 16.55% increase for the PBS perfusion group and a 39.84 +/- 15.59% increase for the AdNull treated group) and the AdTE-GFP transfected group showing a decreased AD (23.04 +/- 14.49%, P < .01). Histological studies showed that the AdTE-GFP transfected group also had reconstructed elastic fibers in the aneurysmal wall. Real-time PCR for TE mRNA demonstrated a significant increase upon transfection of AdTE-GFP in vitro and in vivo. Western blot analysis for GFP demonstrated elastin-GFP expression only upon transfection of AdTE-GFP, although the amount of elastin-GFP protein tended to be lower in vivo than in vitro. Elastin von-Giesson stain combined with GFP antibody immunohistochemistry demonstrated new elastic fibers in the transfected aneurysmal VSMCs.\nVSMCs were transfected efficiently with a special AdTE-GFP vector, enabling recombinant elastin to be produced in these VSMCs in vitro and in vivo. This expression of a recombinant elastin and the related reconstruction of elastic fibers within the aneurysmal tissue appeared to prevent or reverse the aneurysm dilatation.",

    "abstract": "The patency of prosthetic grafts is partly limited by incomplete endothelial cell coverage and development of anastomotic intimal hyperplasia. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of elevated cholesterol on prosthetic graft healing and the ability of alpha-tocopherol to improve healing.\nRabbits were placed on one of four diets: chow, chow plus 1% cholesterol, chow plus alpha-tocopherol, or chow plus 1% cholesterol and alpha-tocopherol. After 2 weeks, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (12-cm long, 4-mm internal diameter) were implanted in the abdominal aorta. Grafts were removed after 6 weeks and analyzed for cholesterol and alpha-tocopherol content, endothelial coverage, anastomotic intimal thickness, and cellular composition of the neointima.\nAt the time of graft implantation, plasma cholesterol was 34 +/- 4 mg/dL in the chow group and 689 +/- 30 mg/dL in the 1% cholesterol group (P < .05). Grafts removed from hypercholesterolemic rabbits had marked intimal thickening, with an intima/graft thickness ratio of 0.76 +/- 0.29 compared with 0.14 +/- 0.06 in chow animals (P < .05). Macrophage infiltrate was increased to 45 +/- 11 macrophages/0.625 mm(2) in grafts from hypercholesterolemic rabbits compared with 0 +/- 0.4 in controls (P < .05). Endothelialization of grafts was lower in hypercholesterolemic rabbits than in the chow group, with endothelial cells covering 46% +/- 7% and 62% +/- 7% of the graft surface, respectively (P = .05). When alpha-tocopherol was added to the 1% cholesterol diet, the macrophage count decreased to 12 +/- 8, the intimal/graft thickness ratio decreased to 0.17 +/- 0.09, and endothelial coverage increased to 70% +/- 7% (P < .05 compared with the high-cholesterol group).\nAnastomotic intimal hyperplasia is dramatically increased and endothelialization is reduced in rabbits on a high-cholesterol diet, but alpha-tocopherol supplementation blocks the augmented neointimal thickening and improves endothelial cell coverage.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the relationships between the interface pressure produced by intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices, the deformation of extremity tissues produced by this pressure, and changes in venous blood flow associated with this deformation by use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and duplex ultrasound (DUS) imaging in addition to the pressure measurement.\nThe calf garments of two IPC devices (WizAir, Medical Compression Systems, Inc, Ltd, Or-Akiva, Israel; VenaFlow, AirCast Inc, Summit, NJ) were tested in five healthy volunteers. The interface pressure was measured with Tactilus Human Body Interface sensor system (Sensor Products Inc, Madison, NJ). Changes in tissue volumes were assessed with MRI. Velocity and flow changes in the great saphenous vein (GSV) and femoral veins (FV) were evaluated by DUS scans.\nThe spatial distribution of interface pressure differed substantially between the two devices. These differences were in the location and percentage of calf surface area to which different pressure was applied. Both devices produced the tissue compression consistent with each device's unique pattern of the interface pressure distribution. Compression by the IPC devices was associated with a measurable decrease in the volume of subcutaneous tissue under the garment, the total volume of superficial veins, and the volume of the GSV. No measurable changes occurred in subfascial volume of the calf. Compression was associated with significant increase in flow velocities in the GSV and FV. The increase of volume flow was significant in FV, but not in GSV. Comparing hemodynamic data with MRI data showed that the flow velocity increase in FV and GSV caused by IPC highly correlated with decrease in volume of superficial veins and subcutaneous tissue measured by MRI, but not with changes in subfascial volume. A single strongest predictor of venous flow increase was the change in subcutaneous veins volume.\nThis methodology provides means for the investigation of relationships between the pressure in the garment, interface pressure, tissue deformation, and hemodynamic respond to IPC. The clinical efficacy of IPC should not be explicitly attributed to the magnitude of the pressure in the garment. Similar hemodynamic responses to IPC can be produced by different spatial distributions of pressure resulting in different patterns of tissue compression. Further investigation of biomechanical mechanisms of IPC is needed to guide the development of better engineering solutions for mechanical devices aimed at prevention of venous thrombosis.",

Computerized image analysis was used to detect protein spots. Differentially expressed protein spots were in-gel digested and identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Western blot analysis was used to confirm differential expression.\nSeven differentially expressed proteins were detected among 745 protein spots, selecting spots whose average relative volumes differed more than twofold between the nonruptured and the ruptured group. Four protein spots were up-regulated in the ruptured group, and three were down-regulated. Five of the spots were identified. Among the upregulated spots, No. 605 was identified as peroxiredoxin-2. The up-regulation was confirmed by Western blotting. No. 381 was identified as an actin fragment. Two spots, Nos. 719 and 499, could not be identified. Among the down-regulated protein spots, No. 130 contained two peptides; one reliably determined peptide, FEDGVLDPDYPR, is found in vitronectin.

Because US military casualties can be more easily followed globally, our objective was to further characterize R-IVCF outcomes in a trauma population with improved follow-up.\nFrom July 2003 to June 2007, trauma registry records were retrospectively reviewed for US soldiers injured in Iraq and Afghanistan who had R-IVCF placement. Indications, type of filter, complications, outcomes, and retrieval data were analyzed.\nSeventy-two R-IVCFs were placed during the study period. Mean follow-up was 28.0 +/- 12.0 months, in 61 (85%) patients. Mean injury severity score (ISS) was 36.3 +/- 10.4 and mean patient age was 27.4 +/- 6.4 years. Fifty-nine R-IVCFs (82%) were not retrieved due to: death (1, 1.3%), technical failure (2, 2.8%), lost to follow-up (11, 15.2%), or contraindications to retrieval (45, 62.5%). Thirteen R-IVCFs were successfully removed, an overall retrieval rate of 18%. Median dwell time of those removed was 47 days (range, 10-94). IVCF indications were prophylactic in 23 (32%) and therapeutic in 49 (68%) cases. Both retrieval failures were due to incorporation into the caval wall, attempted at 90 and 156 days. Deep vein thromboses at the insertion site or pulmonary embolism following R-IVCF placement or removal were not observed. To date, there have been no reports of IVC stenosis or occlusion.\nR-IVCFs were safely and effectively used in severely injured military trauma patients with high ISS. Despite improved follow-up, overall retrieval remained low, reflecting the civilian experience. Indication, rather than follow-up losses, accounted for the low retrieval rate. Practice patterns for R-IVCF in trauma may need to be re-examined to optimize outcomes.",

Fifty-nine R-IVCFs (82%) were not retrieved due to: death (1, 1.3%), technical failure (2, 2.8%), lost to follow-up (11, 15.2%), or contraindications to retrieval (45, 62.5%). Thirteen R-IVCFs were successfully removed, an overall retrieval rate of 18%. Median dwell time of those removed was 47 days (range, 10-94). IVCF indications were prophylactic in 23 (32%) and therapeutic in 49 (68%) cases. Both retrieval failures were due to incorporation into the caval wall, attempted at 90 and 156 days. Deep vein thromboses at the insertion site or pulmonary embolism following R-IVCF placement or removal were not observed. To date, there have been no reports of IVC stenosis or occlusion.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate feasibility, technical success, and the need for reintervention in the early perioperative period, following the introduction of intraoperative DynaCT (DynaCT, Siemens AG, Berlin, Germany) in patients undergoing infrarenal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). DynaCT involves the generation of computed tomography (CT)-like images from \"on table\" rotational angiographic acquisition.\nA prospectively maintained database of 312 patients undergoing EVAR (September 2001 - February 2007) was interrogated to determine incidence of early reintervention following satisfactory appearances of uniplanar completion angiography (control group). Following the introduction of DynaCT (DynaCT group - 80 patients), clinical and radiologic outcomes were prospectively evaluated (September 2007 - May 2008). Both groups underwent pre-discharge computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and color-flow duplex scan. Comparative analysis of procedural data, hospital-stay, mortality, and early reintervention between the two groups was undertaken.\nIn the control group, 14 (4.5%) patients required reintervention procedures within 30 days of EVAR (10 endovascular, 7 surgical). Six patients had type 1 endoleaks and 8 presented with acute limb ischemia. Review of this cohort suggested that the majority of complications (86%) may have been immediately identifiable with improved intra-operative quality control. In the DynaCT group, DynaCT was feasible in 81.3% (n = 65/80) of patients and resulted in the detection of five clinically significant anomalies (6.25%, n = 5/80). These technical problems were not identified at completion angiography but were corrected after DynaCT (2 type 1 endoleaks, 1 type 3 endoleak, 1 limb compression, and 1 graft thrombosis). Standard pre-discharge imaging did not identify any further graft-related complications in the DynaCT group. Introduction of DynaCT resulted in a reduced need for early reintervention (0/80 vs 14/312, P = .05).\nMost graft-related complications that mandate early reintervention following EVAR are due to remediable technical problems which are not identified by uniplanar completion angiography alone. DynaCT is a feasible intra-operative adjunct to completion angiography, which improves intra-operative quality control during endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms.",

We report a new surgical approach to flow reduction by transposition of the radial artery to the elbow level.\nFrom 1992 to 2008, 47 consecutive patients (22 women) with brachial artery to elbow vein autogenous fistula underwent flow reduction via replacement of brachial artery by transposed distal radial artery inflow. Fistulas were side-to-end either brachial-cephalic (19) or brachial-basilic (28). The indications were hand ischemia (4), cardiac failure (13), concerns about future cardiac dysfunction (23), and chronic venous hypertension resulting in aneurysmal degeneration of the vein (7). Mean patient age was 44 years, 11% were diabetic, 17% were smokers, and mean BMI was 22. Mean fistula age before flow reduction was 2.5 years.\nTechnical success was 91% (43 of 47). The mean flow rate dropped by 66% +/- 14%. Clinical success in symptomatic patients was 75% (18 of 24). The fistula eventually had to be ligated in three cases of cardiac failure because of insufficient clinical improvement. All four patients with hand ischemia were cured, with no recurrence during follow-up. Primary patency rates at one and three years were 61% +/- 7% and 40% +/- 8%. Secondary patency rates at one and three years were 89% +/- 5% and 70% +/- 8%.\nTransposition of the radial artery, a safe and effective technique, might now be considered in the surgical armamentarium of flow reduction techniques.",

    "abstract": "Plaque instability is recognized as a multivessel phenomenon related to inflammation. This study examined if the morphology of femoral plaques was related to that of carotid plaques.\nThe echogenicity of femoral and carotid plaques of 102 patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) was studied and classified as echolucent or echorich according to the gray-scale median (GSM) value, which was 53.6 for femoral plaques and 55.2 for carotid plaques. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and neutrophil count were also measured.\nEcholucent carotid plaques were more frequent in patients with echolucent than in those with echorich femoral plaques (55.8% vs 32.0%; P < .01). At multivariate analysis, femoral GSM lower than the median was the only significant predictor of echolucent carotid plaques (odds ratio [OR], 3.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.53-9.83). Patients with echolucent femoral plaques had higher serum CRP levels (P < .01) and a higher neutrophil count (P = .029) than patients with echorich femoral plaques. However, univariate analysis showed that neutrophil count (OR, 3.48; 95% CI, 1.23-9.85) but not hs-CRP was associated with echolucent carotid plaques. At multivariate analysis, neutrophil count exceeding the median remained associated with echolucent carotid plaques (OR, 5.71; 95% CI, 1.37-23.85), whereas the association between femoral and carotid echolucency was attenuated (OR, 3.75; 95% CI, 0.98-4.43).\nIn PAD, the presence of echolucent femoral plaques is associated with a greater prevalence of echolucent carotid plaques, probably as a consequence of a more pronounced inflammatory profile. This confirms and extends the finding that plaque echolucency is a multivessel phenomenon. Prospective studies are needed to assess whether carotid screening in PAD patients might contribute to improving clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Measuring patient-centered outcomes is becoming increasingly important in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), both as a means of determining the benefits of treatment and as an aid for disease management. In order to monitor health status in a reliable and sensitive way, the disease-specific measure Peripheral Artery Questionnaire (PAQ) was developed. However, to date, its correlation with traditional clinical indices is unknown. The primary aim of this study was to better establish the clinical validity of the PAQ by examining its association with functional indices related to PAD. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the clinical validity of this disease-specific measure is better as compared with the EuroQol-5-dimensional (EQ-5D), a standardized generic instrument.\nData on 711 consecutive PAD patients undergoing surgery were collected from 11 Dutch hospitals in 2004. At 3-year follow-up, questionnaires including the PAQ, EQ-5D, and EuroQol-Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) were completed in 84% of survivors. The PAQ was analyzed according to three domains, as established by a factor analyses in the Dutch population, and the summary score. Baseline clinical indices included the presence and severity of claudication intermittent (CI) and the Lee Cardiac Risk Index.\nAll three PAQ domains (Physical Function, Perceived Disability, and Treatment Satisfaction) were significantly associated with CI symptoms (P values < .001-.008). Patients with claudication had significant lower PAQ summary scores as compared with asymptomatic patients (58.6 +/- 27.8 vs 68.6 +/- 27.8, P = < .001). Furthermore, the PAQ summary score and the subscale scores for Physical Functioning and Perceived Disability demonstrated a clear dose-response relation for walking distance and the Lee Risk Index (P values < .001-.031). With respect to the generic EQ-5D, the summary EQ-5D index was associated with CI (0.81 +/- 0.20 vs 0.76 +/- 0.24, P = .031) but not with walking distance (P = .128) nor the Lee Risk Index (P = .154). The EQ VAS discriminated between the clinical indices (P values = .003-.008), although a clear dose-response relation was lacking.\nThe clinical validity of the PAQ proved to be good as the PAQ subscales discriminated well between patients with or without symptomatic PAD and its severity as defined by walking distance. Furthermore, the PAQ subscales were directly proportional to the presence and number of risk factors relevant for PAD. For studying outcomes in PAD patients, the disease-specific PAQ is likely to be a more sensitive measure of treatment benefit as compared with the generic EQ VAS, although the latter may still be of value when comparing health status across different diseases. Regarding disease management, we advocate the use of the disease-specific PAQ as its greater sensitivity and validity will assist its translation into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has had an expanding role as primary therapy for vein graft stenosis with variable results. The aim of this study is to identify patient and graft characteristics predictive of failure after PTA of infrainguinal vein grafts.\nRetrospective review from Jan 2004 to Mar 2007 of patients undergoing angioplasty for failing grafts. Demographics, comorbidities, procedural data, and follow-up information were recorded. PTA failure was defined as first significant event including restenosis by duplex scan (>3.5 x velocity ratio), occlusion, redo-PTA, surgical revision, or amputation. Descriptive, logistic regression and life-table analyses were performed.\nEighty-seven grafts in 79 patients underwent PTA. Mean age was 70 years (median 70; range, 39-89 years), 71% were male and 52% were symptomatic (40% with limb-threat). Mean follow-up was 17 months (median 17.4; range, 0.03-39.8 months). Freedom from PTA failure was 58% (standard error [SE] 0.0574) at 12 months. Predictors of PTA failure by multivariate analysis were: time from bypass <3 months (hazard ratio [HR] 5.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.91-18.0; P = .002), stenosis length >2 cm (HR 2.7; 95% CI 1.33-5.83; P = .007) and multiple stenoses (HR 2.5; 95% CI 1.29-5.1; P = .007). PTA patency for grafts with favorable lesions (single, less than 2 cm lesions in grafts older than 3 months) was 71% vs 35% for unfavorable lesions at 12 months. Limb-salvage was 95% and 90% and overall survival was 92% and 81% at 12 and 24 months, respectively.\nPTA of failing infrainguinal vein grafts is a reasonable primary therapy for favorable lesions. Early graft stenosis, long, and multiple stenoses are markers for procedural failure and are better served with surgical revision.",

    "abstract": "Claudication is the most common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) producing significant ambulatory compromise. The purpose of this study was to use advanced biomechanical analysis to characterize the kinematic ambulatory pattern of claudicating patients. We hypothesized that compared with control subjects, claudicating patients have altered kinematic gait patterns that can be fully characterized utilizing advanced biomechanical analysis.\nThe study examined fourteen PAD patients (age: 58 +/- 3.4 years; weight: 80.99 +/- 15.64 kg) with clinically diagnosed femoro-popliteal occlusive disease (Ankle Brachial Index (ABI): 0.56 +/- 0.03, range 0.45 to 0.65) and five healthy controls (age: 53 +/- 3.4 years; weight: 87.38 +/- 12.75 kg; ABI >or= 1). Kinematic parameters (hip, knee, and ankle joint angles in the sagittal plane) were evaluated during gait in patients before and after the onset of claudication pain and compared with healthy controls. Joint angles were calculated during stance time. Dependent variables were assessed (maximum and minimum flexion and extension angles and ranges of motion) and mean ensemble curves were generated. Time to occurrence of the discrete variables was also identified.\nSignificantly greater ankle plantar flexion in early stance and ankle range of motion during stance was observed in PAD patients (P < .05). Time to maximum ankle plantar flexion was shorter and time to maximum ankle dorsiflexion was longer in PAD patients (P < .05). These differences were noted when comparing PAD patients prior to and after the onset of claudication with healthy controls. The analysis of the kinematic parameters of the knee and the hip joints revealed no significant differences between PAD patients and controls.\nPAD patients with claudication demonstrate significant gait alterations in the ankle joint that are present prior to the onset of claudication pain. In contrast, the joint motion of the hip and knee did not differ in PAD patients when compared with controls. Further research is needed to verify our findings and assess the impact of more proximal disease in PAD patients as well as the effect of revascularization on joint kinematics.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture is believed to occur when the local mechanical stress exceeds the local mechanical strength of the wall tissue. On the basis of this hypothesis, the knowledge of the stress acting on the wall of an unruptured aneurysm could be useful in determining the risk of rupture. The role of asymmetry has previously been identified in idealized AAA models and is now studied using realistic AAAs in the current work.\nFifteen patient-specific AAAs were studied to estimate the relationship between wall stress and geometrical parameters. Three-dimensional AAA models were reconstructed from computed tomography scan data. The stress distribution on the AAA wall was evaluated by the finite element method, and peak wall stress was compared with both diameter and centerline asymmetry. A simple method of determining asymmetry was adapted and developed. Statistical analyses were performed to determine potential significance of results.\nMean von Mises peak wall stress +/- standard deviation was 0.4505 +/- 0.14 MPa (range, 0.3157-0.9048 MPa). Posterior wall stress increases with anterior centerline asymmetry. Peak stress increased by 48% and posterior wall stress by 38% when asymmetry was introduced into a realistic AAA model.\nThe relationship between posterior wall stress and AAA asymmetry showed that excessive bulging of one surface results in elevated wall stress on the opposite surface. Assessing the degree of bulging and asymmetry that is experienced in an individual AAA may be of benefit to surgeons in the decision-making process and may provide a useful adjunct to diameter as a surgical intervention guide.",

    "abstract": "This study describes the results and functioning of community-based supervised exercise therapy (SET) at one year of follow-up.\nWe conducted a prospective cohort study of community-based SET in regional physiotherapeutic practices. Consecutive patients with intermittent claudication referred for community-based SET were included. Exclusion criteria for SET were pain at rest or tissue loss. All patients received a diagnostic workup consisting of an ankle-brachial index at rest and after exercise. Interventions were exercise therapy according to the guidelines of the Royal Dutch Society for Physiotherapy. The primary outcome measurement was the increase in absolute claudication distance (ACD), assessed using a standardized treadmill protocol by a physiotherapist at baseline and at four, 12, 26, and 52 weeks of SET.\nFrom January 2005 through September 2006, 349 patients were referred by vascular surgeons for community-based SET. A total of 272 patients with intermittent claudication began the program. Of the 349 initially referred patients, 52 could not perform a standard treadmill test but did start community-based SET at a lower level, and 25 patients never started the program. At one year, 129 of the original 272 patients who began community-based SET (47.4%) were available for analysis of walking distance. In the interim, 143 patients discontinued the program for the following reasons: satisfaction with the acquired walking distance (n = 19); unsatisfying results (n = 26); not motivated (n = 22); (non)vascular intercurrent disease (n = 48); and other reasons (n = 28). ACD increased significantly from a median of 400 m at baseline to 1100 m after 12 months of follow-up (P < .001), corresponding to a median increase of 107.8%.\nCommunity-based SET seems as effective as SET in a hospital-based approach in improving walking distance, however, it has a high dropout rate.",

Possible gender differences regarding hereditary patterns have been reported.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the risk of developing an AAA for first-degree relatives of patients with AAA in Sweden and compare them with matched controls and their relatives.\nAll persons (3183) born after 1932, diagnosed with AAA between 2001 and 2005, and a random selection of 15,943 age-, gender-, and region-matched controls were included. First-degree relatives of cases and controls were identified via the Multigeneration Register. Family history of AAA for cases and controls was assessed by linking the relatives to the Hospital Discharge Register and Cause of Death Register. The data were analyzed by conditional logistic regression.\nThe overall relative risk of AAA associated with family history compared to no family history was 1.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-2.2). Comorbidities were more common among the cases than the controls (P < .0001) but the relative risks remained unchanged after adjustment for comorbidities. Stratification for absence or presence of comorbidities showed no significant difference between the two groups (P = .29). The relative risk of AAA for first-degree relatives was similar for women and men (P = .22 for gender differences), ie, the relative risk of AAA was not dependent on the gender of the index person.\nIn this nationwide survey, the relative risk of developing AAA for first-degree relatives to persons diagnosed with AAA was approximately doubled compared to persons with no family history. Neither the gender of the index person nor the first-degree relative influenced the risk of AAA.",

    "abstract": "The brachial artery is often used for coronary angiography. However, data on brachial access for aortic and peripheral interventions are limited. This study evaluated our experience with brachial artery catheterization for diagnostic arteriography and endovascular interventions.\nBetween August 2004 and August 2005, 2026 endovascular procedures were performed. Of these, 323 cases (16%) in 289 patients required brachial artery access, forming the basis for this study. Patients who underwent multiple interventions, but with a single access (ie, thrombolysis), were considered a single case. Demographic and clinical data were recorded in a database and analyzed using logistic regression analyses with generalized estimating equations and the Fisher exact test for nominal variables.\nThe mean age of all patients was 66.4 years, with 57% men. Brachial access was used for diagnostic purposes in 27% and for interventions including angioplasty, stenting, and thrombolysis in 73%. The use of brachial access was considered obligatory in 40%, adjunctive in 19% (ie, endovascular repair of abdominal aortic and thoracic aortic aneurysms) and preferential to femoral access in 41%. In 91% of patients, the brachial arteries were accessed percutaneously, and 9% underwent surgical cutdown for access. In patients whose brachial artery was approached percutaneously, access was achieved in all but one (99.6% technical success rate). Hemostasis after catheterization was achieved by manual compression in 89%. Operative mortality rate was 6.2% and not related to brachial artery access. Brachial access site-related complications occurred in 21 patients (6.5%). Thirteen of these 21 patients (62%) required a surgical correction, mostly for brachial artery thrombosis or pseudoaneurysm. Patients with complications were more commonly women (odds ratio [OR], 4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-13.26; P = .003) and had a long interventional sheath (OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 1.53-29.07; P = .012). The risk of a brachial artery complication was not associated with thrombolysis, procedure type, vascular territory treated, or the use of heparin. No upper extremity limb or finger loss occurred.\nBrachial artery access is necessary for complex endovascular procedures and can be achieved in most patients safely. Postprocedural vigilance is warranted because most patients with complications will require operative correction.",

    "abstract": "Risk factors for perioperative and late mortality after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) remain ill-defined. In this study, we examined the prognostic significance of chronic kidney disease (CKD), a well-known predictor of death after thoracic aorta open repair, employing a stratification based on CKD stages derived from glomerular filtration rate (GFR) values.\nA prospective database was evaluated for 179 consecutive patients electively submitted to TEVAR between 1999 and 2007. Preoperative GFR was estimated by using the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Patient groups were stratified into four quartiles by baseline serum creatinine (SC) and GFR values, with quartile I being the lowest, and quartile IV the highest, and into the five CKD stages in reverse order (I GFR >or= 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2); II 60-89; III 30-59; IV 15-29; V < 15). Prognostic significance of preoperative GFR values and CKD stages were investigated by means of univariate and multivariate analyses, and the Kaplan-Meier log-rank method.\nA primary technical success was achieved in 166 of 179 patients (92.7%), and an initial clinical success in 158 (88.3%). Thirty-day mortality was 5% (nine cases). Paraplegia or paraparesis were observed in 11 (6.1%) patients, and completely resolved in six cases after cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Preoperative GFR quartiles and CKD stages were significant predictors of 30-day mortality (P = .004 and P < .0001 respectively), whereas SC quartiles did not affect the outcome (P = .12). In particular, GFR quartile I (<60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) was associated with a ten-fold greater risk of perioperative death compared with the other three quartiles (Odds Ratio 11.4, 95% Confidence Interval 2.3-57.0, P = .003). Midterm survival was 88.8% (159 of 179) at a mean follow-up of 35.6 +/- 23.7 months. Actuarial survival at 60 months was 57.8%, 81.1%, 92.3%, and 100% for GFR quartiles I to IV respectively (P < .0001), and 0.0%, 66.7%, 59.2%, 88.6%, and 100% (P < .0001) for CKD stage V to I respectively. At univariate analyses, age (P = .019), preoperative SC quartiles (P = .001), GFR quartiles (P = .0002), and CKD stages (P < .0001) were all predictive of mid-term mortality. At multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, only CKD stages remained independently associated with the outcome (P = .008).\nGFR is an accurate prognostic predictor in patients submitted to TEVAR. Also, perioperative and midterm mortality directly correlate with the severity of CKD stages, allowing a risk stratification model to be employed both for risk-adjusted preoperative evaluation, and to establish accurate matching criteria for comparative studies.",

Patient symptoms included both claudication and limb threatening ischemia with or without tissue loss. The TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus (TASC) II A (N = 18), B (N = 56), C (N = 11), and D (N = 15) lesions were included. Patients were randomized prospectively into one of two treatment groups; a percutaneous treatment group (group A; N = 50) with angioplasty and placement of one or more stent-grafts or a surgical treatment group (group B; N = 50) with a femoral to above knee popliteal artery bypass using synthetic conduit (Dacron graft or ePTFE). Patients were followed for a total of 24 months. Follow-up evaluation included clinical assessment and physical examination, ankle-brachial indices (ABI), and color flow duplex sonography at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.\nThe mean total lesion length of the treated arterial segment in the stent-graft group was 25.6 cm (SD +/- 15 cm). The stent-graft group demonstrated a primary patency of 81%, 72%, and 63% with a secondary patency of 86%, 83%, and 74% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. The surgical femoral-popliteal group demonstrated a primary patency of 84%, 77%, and 64% with a secondary patency of 89%, 86%, and 76% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. No statistical difference was found between the two groups with respect to primary (P = .716) or secondary patency (P = .695). Grouping of less severe (TASC II A/B) vs more severe (TASC II C/D) lesions demonstrated patency at 24 months for the femoral-popliteal arm of 63% and 67%, respectively while that of the stent-graft arm was 64% and 47%, respectively. Secondary patency was 76% in both TASC classifications for the femoral-popliteal arm with 78% and 47% patency found respectively in the stent-graft group. These resulted in no significant difference for primary (P = .978) or secondary (P = .653) patency overall, although there is a trend for decreased patency with higher TASC II lesions.\nManagement of superficial femoral artery occlusive disease with percutaneous stent-grafts exhibits similar primary patency at 24-month follow-up when compared with conventional femoral-popliteal artery bypass grafting with synthetic conduit. This treatment method may offer an alternative to treatment of the superficial femoral artery segment for revascularization when prosthetic bypass is being considered or when autologous conduit is unavailable.",

    "abstract": "Older patients are thought to tolerate acute ischemia more poorly than younger patients. Since aging may depress both angiogenesis and arteriogenesis, we determined the effects of age on both angiogenesis and arteriogenesis in a model of severe acute limb ischemia.\nYoung adult (3-months-old) and aged (18-months-old) C57BL/6 mice underwent right common iliac artery and vein ligation and transection. Data were collected on days 0, 7, and 14. Perfusion was measured with a laser Doppler scan and compared to the contralateral limb. Functional deficits were evaluated with the Tarlov scale. Capillary density and endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) number were determined by direct counting lectin-positive/alpha-actin-negative cells and VEGFR2/CXCR4 dually-positive cells, respectively; angiography was performed to directly assess arteriogenesis.\nYoung adult and aged mice had a similar degree of decreased perfusion after iliac ligation (young, n = 15: 20.4 +/- 1.9%, vs aged, n = 20: 19.6 +/- 1.3%; P = .72, analysis of variance [ANOVA]); however, young mice recovered faster and to a greater degree than aged mice (day 7, 35 +/- 6% vs 17 +/- 4%, P = .046; day 14, 60 +/- 5% vs 27 +/- 7%, P = .0014). Aged mice had worse functional recovery by day 14 compared to young mice (2.3 +/- 0.3 vs 4.3 +/- 0.4; P = .0021). Aged mice had increased capillary density (day 7, 12.9 +/- 4.4 vs 2.8 +/- 0.3 capillaries/hpf; P = .02) and increased number of EPC incorporated into the ischemic muscle (day 7, 8.1 +/- 0.9 vs 2.5 +/- 1.9 cells; P = .007) compared to young mice, but diminished numbers of collateral vessels to the ischemic limb (1 vs 9; P = .01), as seen on angiography.\nAfter severe hind limb ischemia, aged animals become ischemic to a similar degree as young animals, but aged animals have significantly impaired arteriogenesis and functional recovery compared to younger animals. These results suggest that strategies to stimulate arteriogenesis may complement those that increase angiogenesis, and may result in improved relief of ischemia.",

    "abstract": "More effective adjuncts are needed to reduce the incidence of acute renal injury after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. The purpose of this randomized trial was to determine whether renal perfusion with cold blood provides better protection against renal ischemia than perfusion with cold crystalloid in patients undergoing TAAA repair with left heart bypass.\nOne hundred seventy-two patients were enrolled. Strict inclusion criteria were used, including planned Crawford extent II or III TAAA repair with left heart bypass. The patients were randomly assigned to receive intermittent renal perfusion with either 4 degrees C lactated Ringer's solution (n = 86) or 4 degrees C blood (n = 86). Renal complications within 10 days of operation were stratified by renal dysfunction score (RDS). Postoperative changes in the levels of five urinary biomarkers-retinol binding protein, alpha-1 microglobulin, microalbumin, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, and intestinal alkaline phosphatase-were compared to assess potential differences in subclinical renal injury.\nAlthough total ischemic times were longer in the cold blood group, unprotected ischemic times were similar between the two groups. Twenty-seven patients in the cold blood group (31%) and 21 patients in the cold crystalloid group (24%) had peak RDS >or=2 (serum creatinine >50% above baseline; P = .4). There were no differences between the cold blood and cold crystalloid groups in the incidence of early death (7/86 [8%] vs 5/86 [6%], respectively; P = .8) or renal failure requiring hemodialysis (3/86 [3%] in both groups). Changes in renal biomarker levels were also similar in the two groups. Spinal cord deficits developed in 5 patients in the cold blood group (6%); there were no such deficits in the cold crystalloid group (P = .06).\nCold renal perfusion during TAAA repair provides effective protection against renal injury. Using cold blood instead of cold crystalloid does not enhance renal protection.",

    "abstract": "Ghrelin, a novel growth hormone-releasing peptide, is implicated to play a protective role in cardiovascular tissues. However, it is not clear whether ghrelin protects vascular tissues from injury secondary to risk factors such as homocysteine (Hcy). This study investigated the effect and potential mechanisms of ghrelin on Hcy-induced endothelial dysfunction.\nPorcine coronary artery rings were incubated for 24 hours with ghrelin (100 ng/mL), Hcy (50 microM), or ghrelin plus Hcy. Endothelial vasomotor function was evaluated using the myograph tension model. The response to the thromboxane A(2)analog U46619, bradykinin, and sodium nitroprusside was analyzed. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry staining, and superoxide anion production was documented lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence analysis. Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) were treated with different concentrations of Hcy, ghrelin, or antighrelin receptor antibody for 24 hours, and eNOS protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis.\nMaximal contraction with U46619 and endothelium-independent vasorelaxation with sodium nitroprusside were not different among the four groups. However, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation with bradykinin (10(-6) M) was significantly reduced by 34% with Hcy compared with controls (P < .05). The addition of ghrelin to Hcy had a protective effect, with 61.6% relaxation, which was similar to controls (64.7%). Homocysteine significantly reduced eNOS expression, whereas ghrelin cotreatment effectively restored eNOS expression to the control levels. Superoxide anion levels, which were increased by 100% with Hcy, returned to control levels with ghrelin cotreatment. Ghrelin also effectively blocked the Hcy-induced decrease of eNOS protein levels in HCAECs in a concentration-dependent manner. Antighrelin receptor antibody effectively inhibited the effect of ghrelin.\nGhrelin has a protective effect in the porcine coronary artery by blocking Hcy-induced endothelial dysfunction, improving eNOS expression, and reducing oxidative stress. Ghrelin also shows a protective effect on HCACEs from the Hcy-induced decrease in eNOS protein levels. The effect of ghrelin is receptor-dependent. Thus, ghrelin administration may have beneficial effects in the treatment of vascular disease in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia.",

Patients were subdivided into groups by creatinine level (mg/dL): group 1 (1.5-2.0), group 2 (2.0-3.0), group 3 (>3.0), and group 4 (preoperative dialysis-dependent). Demographics, aneurysm/aortic lesion characteristics, perioperative morbidity, mortality, and follow-up data were compared with 246 control patients (<1.5 mg/dL).\nComorbidities were similar between the renal insufficiency and control groups, except for age (74 +/- 8 vs 69 +/- 6 years, P < .0002), male gender (73% vs 58%, P < .02), and presence of peripheral vascular disease (56% vs 38%, P < .005). Mean follow-up was 9 months. The renal insufficiency and control groups had similar aortic pathologies, including fusiform (51% vs 57%) and saccular aneurysms (27% vs 37%). Overall mean serum creatinine and creatinine clearance did not worsen during follow-up. Perioperatively, 18 patients (21%) patients required dialysis. Nine patients (11%) presented a newly acquired need for dialysis. Degree of preoperative renal impairment correlated with increasing dialysis requirement: group 1, 5% (3 of 55); group 2, 25% (3 of 12); group 3, 38% (3 of 8); and group 4, 100% (9 of 9). Three patients did not recover baseline renal function. Contrast type (isosmolar vs hyposmolar) and amount (96 +/- 8 mL vs 100 +/- 8 mL, P = .33) was similar between the dialysis and no-dialysis groups. Renal insufficiency patients had a statistically significant higher rate of major adverse events (25% vs 6.9%, P < .00003), 30-day mortality (11% vs 4.4%, P < .05), and myocardial infarction (6.0% vs 1.0%, P < .013) than controls.

    "abstract": "Platelet activation and thrombus renewal are keys to intraluminal thrombus formation and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). This study explored the ability of AZD6140, a P2Y(12) receptor antagonist, to inhibit platelet activation and prevent aneurysm development in a rat experimental model of AAA.\nAortic aneurysms were induced by implanting a segment of sodium dodecyl sulfate-decellularized guinea pig aorta in rat aortas. One day later, rats were randomized to AZD6140 (10 mg/kg twice daily by mouth) or diluent (n = 23 per group) for either 10 (n = 18) or 42 days (n = 28). Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-mediated platelet aggregation, aneurysm expansion, intraluminal thrombus formation, inflammatory infiltration, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression, and smooth muscle cell colonization were measured.\nAZD6140 inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation in vivo for 12 hours, justifying twice-daily administration in rats. The spontaneous increase in aortic diameter shown in the aneurysmal model (2.22 +/- 0.56 mm at day 10 vs 5.21 +/- 1.22 mm at day 42) was reduced with AZD6140 (3.61 +/- 1.46 mm at day 42, P < .01). This beneficial effect was associated with a significant reduction of thrombus development, platelet CD41 expression (P < .05), and leukocyte infiltration of the mural thrombus at days 10 and 42 (P < .01). MMP-9 expression correlated with mural thrombus area and was significantly reduced by AZD6140 (P < .05). AZD6140 limited elastic fiber degradation (P < .05) and enhanced progressive colonization of the thrombus by smooth muscle cells at day 42 (P < .01).\nThese data suggest that inhibition of platelet activation limits intraluminal thrombus biologic activities, thereby impairing aneurysm development.",

The spontaneous increase in aortic diameter shown in the aneurysmal model (2.22 +/- 0.56 mm at day 10 vs 5.21 +/- 1.22 mm at day 42) was reduced with AZD6140 (3.61 +/- 1.46 mm at day 42, P < .01). This beneficial effect was associated with a significant reduction of thrombus development, platelet CD41 expression (P < .05), and leukocyte infiltration of the mural thrombus at days 10 and 42 (P < .01). MMP-9 expression correlated with mural thrombus area and was significantly reduced by AZD6140 (P < .05). AZD6140 limited elastic fiber degradation (P < .05) and enhanced progressive colonization of the thrombus by smooth muscle cells at day 42 (P < .01).",

    "abstract": "Mild obesity may have a protective effect against some diseases, termed an \"obesity paradox.\" This study examined the effect of body mass index (Kg/m(2) BMI) on surgical 30-day morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing vascular surgical procedures.\nAs part of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), demographic and clinical risk variables, mortality, and 22 defined complications (morbidity) were obtained over three years from vascular services at 14 medical centers. At each medical center, patients from the operative schedule were prospectively and systematically enrolled according to NSQIP protocols. Outcomes and risk variables were compared across NIH-defined obesity classes (underweight [BMI<or=18.5], normal [18.5<BMI<25], overweight [25<BMI<or=30], obese I [30<BMI<or=35], obese II [35<BMI<or=40], and obese III [BMI>40]) using analysis of variance and means comparisons. Logistic regression was used to control for other risk factors.\nVascular procedures in 7,543 patients included lower extremity revascularization (24.6%), aneurysm repair (17.4%), cerebrovascular procedures (17.3%), amputations (9.4%), and \"other\" procedures (31.3%). In the entire cohort, there were 1,659 (22.0%) patients with complications and 295 (3.9%) deaths. Risk factors of hypertension and diabetes increased with BMI (analysis of variance [ANOVA] P < .05) as expected; smoking, disseminated cancer, and stroke decreased (ANOVA P < .01). Twenty other risk factors, as well as mortality and morbidity, had \"U\" or \"J\"-shaped distributions with the highest incidence in underweight and/or obese class III extremes but reduced minimums in overweight or obese I classes (ANOVA P < .05). After controlling for age, gender, and operation type, mortality risk remained lowest in obese class I patients (Odds ratio [OR] 0.63, P = .023) while morbidity risk was highest in obese class III patients (OR 1.70, P = .0003), due to wound infection, thromboembolism, and renal complications.\nUnderweight patients have poorer outcomes and class III obesity is associated with increased morbidity. Mildly obese patients have reduced co-morbid illness, surprisingly even less than normal-class patients, with correspondingly reduced mortality. Mild obesity is not a risk factor for 30-day outcomes after vascular surgery and confers an advantage.",

    "abstract": "As the first operational societal registry of carotid procedures, the Outcomes Committee of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) developed the Vascular Registry (VR) in response to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) National Coverage Decision on carotid artery stenting (CAS). Although CMS requires data submission only on CAS, the VR collects similar data on carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to allow comparison of outcomes, as well as potential for expansion to other procedures.\nSVS-VR on-line provider-reported data include baseline through follow-up visits to better understand long-term risks and benefits associated with CAS and CEA. The primary outcomes are combined death, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI). An independent data coordinating center maintains the database, which is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant and auditable.\nAs of December 26, 2007, 6403 procedures with discharge data were entered by 287 providers at 56 centers on 2763 CAS patients (1450 with 30-day outcomes, 52.5%) and 3259 CEA patients (1368 with 30-day outcomes, 42%). Of the total cohort, 98% of CEA and 70.7% of CAS (P < .001) were performed for atherosclerotic disease. Restenosis accounted for 22.3% and post-radiation induced stenosis in 4.5% of CAS patients. Preprocedure lateralizing neurologic symptoms were present in a greater proportion of CAS patients (49.2%) than CEA patients (42.4%, P < .001). CAS patients also had higher preprocedure prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD), MI, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cardiac arrhythmia. For CAS, death/stroke/MI at 30 days was 7.13% for symptomatic patients and 4.60% for asymptomatic patients (P = .04). For CEA, death/stroke/MI at 30 days was 3.75% in symptomatic patients and 1.97% in asymptomatic patients (P = .05). After risk-adjustment for age, history of stroke, diabetes, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade (ie, factors found to be significant confounders in outcomes using backwards elimination), logistic regression analysis suggested better outcomes following CEA. There were no statistically significant differences when examining CAS outcomes based on center volume. CAS in atherosclerotic disease had significantly worse outcomes than in nonatherosclerotic stenosis. When CAS and CEA were compared in the treatment of atherosclerotic disease only, the difference in outcomes between the two procedures was more pronounced, with death/stroke/MI 6.42% after CAS vs 2.62% following CEA, P < .0001.\nFollowing best possible risk adjustment of these unmatched groups, symptomatic and asymptomatic CAS patients had significantly higher 30-day postprocedure incidence of death/stroke/MI when compared with CEA patients. The initial 1.5 years of data collection provide proof of concept that a specialty society based VR can succeed in meeting regulatory and scientific goals. With continued enrollment and follow-up, analysis of SVS-VR will supplement randomized trials by providing real-world comparisons of CAS and CEA with sufficient numbers to serve as an outcome assessment tool of important patient subsets and across the spectrum of peripheral vascular procedures.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of cranial and cervical nerve injury during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) ranges from less than 7.6% to more than 50%. Lesions are mainly due to surgical maneuvers such as traction, compression, tissue electrocoagulation, clamping, and extensive dissections. The use of dexamethasone (DEX) and its beneficial effects in spinal cord injuries have already been described. We investigated whether DEX could also be beneficial to minimize the incidence of cranial and cervical nerve injury during CEA.\nTo evaluate whether dexamethasone is able to reduce the incidence of cranial nerve injuries.\nFrom March 1999 through April 2006, 1126 patients undergoing CEA because of high-grade carotid stenosis were enrolled and randomized by predetermined randomization tables into two groups. The first group, \"A\", included 586 patients that all received an intravenous administration of dexamethasone following a therapeutic scheme. The second group, \"B\", included 540 control subjects that received the standard pre- and postoperative therapy. All patients were submitted to a deep cervical plexus block, eversion carotid endarterectomy, and selective shunting. Three days after the operation, an independent neurologist and otorhinolaryngologist evaluated the presence of cranial nerve deficits. All patients (group A and group B) showing nerve injuries continued the treatment (8 mg of dexamethasone once in the morning) for 7 days and were re-evaluated after 2 weeks, 30 days, and every 3 months for 1 year. Recovery time took from 2 weeks to 12 months, with a mean time of 3.6 months. The chi(2) test was used to compare the two groups and to check for statistical significance.\nThe incidence of cranial nerve dysfunction was higher in group B and the statistical analysis showed a significant effect of dexamethasone in preventing the neurological damage (P = .0081). The incidence of temporary lesions was lower in group A and the chi(2) test yielded a P value of .006. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the effect of dexamethasone in men and women. In addition, dexamethasone had no statistically significant effect on the incidence of permanent cranial nerve injuries. Finally, no adverse effect related to the administration of dexamethasone was observed.\nPerioperative administration of dexamethasone is effective in minimizing the incidence of temporary cranial nerve injuries during CEA.",

Postoperative and long-term outcome is also related to these risk factors. This study assessed the additional prognostic value of NT-proBNP levels as a simple objective risk marker for postoperative cardiac events among vascular surgery patients.\nA detailed cardiac history (angina, myocardial infarction, age >70 years, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, stroke, heart failure), resting echocardiography, and NT-proBNP levels were obtained in 400 vascular surgery patients. Postoperative troponin-T levels and an electrocardiogram were obtained on days 1, 3, 7, and 30, and whenever clinically indicated. Patients were monitored every 6 months at the outpatient clinic. Study end points were perioperative cardiac events (ie, composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and troponin release) and long-term all-cause mortality. The additional value of NT-proBNP was assessed with multivariable regression analysis. The optimal cutoff value was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.\nPostoperative troponin T release occurred in 79 patients (20%). Cardiac risk factors were used to classify patients as low (0 risk factors), intermediate (1 to 2), and high (>3) cardiac risk (event rate of 7%, 15%, and 37%, respectively). The median NT-proBNP level was 206 pg/mL (interquartile range, 80-548 pg/mL). The risk of postoperative cardiac events was augmented with increasing NT-proBNP, irrespective of underlying cardiac risk factors and type of vascular surgery. In addition to cardiac risk factors only (C index, 0.66) or cardiac risk factors and site and type of surgery (C index, 0.81), NT-proBNP was an excellent tool for further risk stratification (C index, 0.86), with an optimal cutoff value of 350 pg/mL. In multivariate analysis, NT-proBNP >350 pg/mL remained significantly associated with perioperative cardiac events (odds ratio [OR], 4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-10.5, P < .001). NT-proBNP >350 pg/mL was also associated with an independent 1.9-fold (95% CI 1.1-3.2) increased risk for long-term mortality during a median follow-up of 2.4 years.\nNT-proBNP is an independent prognostic marker for postoperative cardiac events and long-term mortality in patients undergoing different types of vascular surgery and might be used for preoperative cardiac risk stratification.",

The primary outcome was residual GSV 6 months after surgery measured by venous duplex ultrasound imaging. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, operation time, and postoperative neural damage. Duration of follow-up was 6 months. Quality of life was measured at 6 and 26 weeks postoperatively with the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ) and Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey.\nThe two groups were well matched at baseline. The percentage of patients with residual GSV at 6 months (primary outcome) was 44% (102 of 230) in the cryo group and 15% (33 of 215) in the conventional group (difference 29%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 21%-37%, P < .001). Median operation time was significantly shorter in the cryo group (30 minutes) compared with the conventional group (39 minutes). Neural damage was 12% in both groups, and thus not significantly different. Scores on the subdomains of the SF-36 showed no significant change between the groups. The AVVQ after conventional stripping was 8.0, which was a better result than the 11.7 result after cryo stripping (difference 2.6 points; 95% CI, 1.0-4.2; P = .001, repeated measurements analysis of variance with adjustment for baseline scores).\nCryo stripping accounts for numerous procedural failures and hence residual GSV in patients. The AVVQ showed small but significantly better results for patients after a conventional stripping. Cryo stripping has no benefits over conventional stripping.",

The percentage of patients with residual GSV at 6 months (primary outcome) was 44% (102 of 230) in the cryo group and 15% (33 of 215) in the conventional group (difference 29%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 21%-37%, P < .001). Median operation time was significantly shorter in the cryo group (30 minutes) compared with the conventional group (39 minutes). Neural damage was 12% in both groups, and thus not significantly different. Scores on the subdomains of the SF-36 showed no significant change between the groups. The AVVQ after conventional stripping was 8.0, which was a better result than the 11.7 result after cryo stripping (difference 2.6 points; 95% CI, 1.0-4.2; P = .001, repeated measurements analysis of variance with adjustment for baseline scores).",

    "abstract": "English language citations reporting complications of arteriovenous access for hemodialysis are critically reviewed and discussed. Venous hypertension, arterial steal syndrome, and high-output cardiac failure occur as a result of hemodynamic alterations potentiated by access flow. Uremic and diabetic neuropathies are common but may obfuscate recognition of potentially correctable problems such as compression or ischemic neuropathy. Mechanical complications include pseudoaneurysm, which may develop from a puncture hematoma, degeneration of the wall, or infection. Dysfunctional hemostasis, hemorrhage, noninfectious fluid collections, and access-related infections are, in part, manifestations of the adverse effects of uremia on the function of circulating hematologic elements. Impaired erythropoiesis is successfully managed with hormonal stimulation; perhaps, similar therapies can be devised to reverse platelet and leukocyte dysfunction and reduce bleeding and infectious complications.",

    "abstract": "Hemodialysis centers regularly survey arteriovenous (AV) accesses for signs of dysfunction. In this review, we synthesize the available evidence to determine to what extent proactive vascular access monitoring affects the incidence of AV access thrombosis and abandonment compared with clinical monitoring.\nWe searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and SCOPUS) and sought references from experts, bibliographies of included trials, and articles that cited included studies. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used random effects meta-analysis to estimate the pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) across studies and conducted subgroup analyses to explain heterogeneity. The I(2) statistic was used to assess heterogeneity of treatment effect among trials.\nNine studies (1363 patients) compared a strategy of surveillance vs clinical monitoring. A vascular intervention to maintain or restore patency was provided to both groups if needed. Surveillance followed by intervention led to a nonsignificant reduction of the risk of access thrombosis (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.58-1.16; I(2) = 37%) and access abandonment (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.51-1.25; I(2) = 60%). Three studies (207 patients) compared the effect of vascular interventions vs observation in patients with abnormal surveillance result. Vascular interventions after an abnormal AV access surveillance led to a significant reduction of the risk of access thrombosis (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36-0.76) and a nonsignificant reduction of the risk of access abandonment (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.43-1.37).\nVery low quality evidence yielding imprecise results suggests a potentially beneficial effect of AV access surveillance followed by interventions to restore patency. This inference, however, is weak and will require randomized trials of AV access surveillance vs clinical monitoring for rejection or confirmation.",

    "abstract": "The autogenous arteriovenous access for chronic hemodialysis is recommended over the prosthetic access because of its longer lifespan. However, more than half of the United States dialysis patients receive a prosthetic access. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the best available evidence comparing the two accesses types in terms of patient-important outcomes.\nWe searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science and SCOPUS) and included randomized controlled trials and controlled cohort studies. We pooled data for each outcome using a random effects model to estimate the relative risk (RR) and its associated 95% confidence interval (CI). We estimated inconsistency caused by true differences between studies using the I(2) statistic.\nEighty-three studies, of which 80 were nonrandomized, met eligibility criteria. Compared with the prosthetic access, the autogenous access was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of death (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67-0.86; I(2) = 48%, 27 studies) and access infection (RR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.11-0.31; I(2) = 93%, 43 studies), and a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of postoperative complications (hematoma, bleeding, pseudoaneurysm and steal syndrome, RR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.48-1.16; I(2) = 65%, 31 studies) and length of hospitalization (pooled weighted mean difference -3.8 days; 95% CI, -7.8 to 0.2; P = .06). The autogenous access also had better primary and secondary patency at 12 and 36 months.\nLow-quality evidence from inconsistent studies with limited protection against bias shows that autogenous access for chronic hemodialysis is superior to prosthetic access.",

    "abstract": "The Society for Vascular Surgery considers the placement and maintenance of arteriovenous hemodialysis access to be an important component of any vascular surgery practice. Therefore, the Society has long been involved in setting the standards for the management of arteriovenous access. Formulating clinical recommendations in this area is the latest effort by the Society to improve the management of arteriovenous access on a national level. To provide an unbiased study of the evidence and to help in formulating the recommendations, the Society used the Knowledge and Encounter Research (KER) Unit of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minn, to review the available evidence and advise a multidisciplinary group of access surgeons and nephrologists in formulating the clinical recommendations. To review the evidence, randomized and observational study designs were both considered. Whenever possible, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literature were used because, compared with individual studies, they generate more precise estimates of treatment effects and their results are applicable to a wider range of patients. On behalf of the Society, the group issued its recommendations following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) format; this format disentangles the strength of recommendations from the quality of the evidence and encourages statements about the underlying values and preferences relevant to the particular recommendation. The recommendations are classified as strong (denoted by the phrase \"we recommend\") or weak (denoted by the phrase \"we suggest\"); and the quality of evidence is classified as high, moderate, low, or very low. These recommendations are not meant to supersede clinical judgment; rather, they should be used as a guide for the practicing surgeon and nephrologist as the decision is being made for the placement and subsequent procedures and management of arteriovenous hemodialysis access are being considered.",

    "abstract": "Recognizing the impact of the decision making by the dialysis access surgeon on the successful placement of autogenous arteriovenous hemodialysis access, the Society for Vascular Surgery assembled a multispecialty panel to develop practice guidelines in arteriovenous access placement and maintenance with the aim of maximizing the percentage and functionality of autogenous arteriovenous accesses that are placed. The Society commissioned the Knowledge and Encounter Research Unit of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, to systematically review the available evidence in three main areas provided by the panel: timing of referral to access surgeons, type of access placed, and effectiveness of surveillance. The panel then formulated practice guidelines in seven areas: timing of referral to the access surgeon, operative strategies to maximize the placement of autogenous arteriovenous accesses, first choice for the autogenous access, choice of arteriovenous access when a patient is not a suitable candidate for a forearm autogenous access, the role of monitoring and surveillance in arteriovenous access management, conversion of a prosthetic arteriovenous access to a secondary autogenous arteriovenous access, and management of the nonfunctional or failed arteriovenous access. For each of the guidelines, the panel stated the recommendation or suggestion, discussed the evidence or opinion upon which the recommendation or suggestion was made, detailed the values and preferences that influenced the group's decision in formulating the relevant guideline, and discussed technical remarks related to the particular guideline. In addition, detailed information is provided on various configurations of autogenous and prosthetic accesses and technical tips related to their placement.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate aortic volume changes in patients with acute type B aortic dissection (TBD), treated either by thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) or conservatively.\nFrom July 1996 through March 2008, 76 patients presenting with acute TBD were referred to our department. To ensure a follow-up of at least 24 months, only 64 of them were included in the present study, with the cut-off for inclusion being March 2006. Twenty-nine of these patients underwent TEVAR and 35 patients underwent conservative treatment. Indications for TEVAR were life-threatening symptoms. Follow-up was performed postinterventionally in patients after TEVAR and at 3, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter in both groups. It included clinical examinations, computed tomography (CT) scans, analysis of volume changes in true thoracic lumen (TTL), false thoracic lumen (FTL), thoracic lumen (TL), abdominal lumen (AL), and aortic diameter measurements. In addition, the extent of thrombosis and its influence on volume changes were assessed.\nMean follow-up was 41 months after TEVAR and 46 months in the conservatively-treated patients. At 60 months, cumulative rates of freedom from dissection-related death and rupture-free survival were 82.6% and 93.1% in the TEVAR group, respectively. They were 74.9% and 88.5% in the conservatively-treated group, respectively. In the conservatively-treated patients, 3 patients died of late aortic rupture, 4 were converted to open surgery, and 2 to TEVAR. Evaluation of volume changes showed better results in the TEVAR group within 24 months. However, within 60 months the difference between the two groups was no longer relevant. Relating to thrombosis of the FTL, analyses showed slightly better overall results and promotion of thrombus formation after TEVAR. However, at 60 months the results showed a tendency towards approximation between the two groups.\nOur data suggest that TEVAR seems to delay the natural course of the disease but not to stop it.",

It is still unclear, however, whether these polymorphisms are a risk factor for other occlusive diseases such as those in visceral arteries. We report a case of a young woman with acute celiac artery thrombosis and multiple platelet receptor polymorphisms. In addition, the intraoperative exploration showed some evidence of a local vascular compression syndrome. The patient was successfully treated with a bypass procedure and combined anticoagulation. It seems that platelet receptor polymorphisms are a moderate risk factor for local artery thrombosis regardless of vascular region. The obligatory precondition is pre-existing vascular damage, such as that caused by a local compression syndrome.",

She was diagnosed with left peripelvic urinary extravasation and forniceal rupture secondary to an intact infrarenal inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm with extensive periaortic fibrosis. Successful operative repair was performed with staged ureteral and endovascular stenting with subsequent resolution of periaortic inflammation and ureteral obstruction, and shrinkage of the aneurysm sac. Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms (IAAAs) represent 5% to 10% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms. The distinguishing features of inflammatory aneurysms include thickening of aneurysm wall, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and adhesions to adjacent retroperitoneal structures. The most commonly involved adjacent structures are the duodenum, left renal vein, and ureter. Adhesions to the urinary system can cause hydronephrosis or hydroureter and result in obstructive uropathy. An unusual case of IAAA presenting with forniceal rupture is presented, with successful endovascular and endourologic repair.",

These complications can occur as a result of an increase in abdominal pressure leading to a variety of well-documented visceral injuries, including the great vessels. Acute abdominal aortic thrombosis after the Heimlich maneuver is a rare but recognized event; however, to date no case of traumatic dissection and rupture of the abdominal aorta has been described. We report the first known case, to our knowledge, of a traumatic dissection and rupture of the abdominal aorta after a forcefully applied Heimlich maneuver.",

    "abstract": "Management of highly vascular carotid body tumors can involve pre-operative percutaneous embolization before definitive surgical resection. This step reduces tumor size, reduces operative blood loss, and makes for a less hazardous dissection with the goal of reducing morbidity and mortality. The effectiveness of a recently described technique of interrupting vascular supply via covered stent placement in the external carotid artery is further described in a series of three recent cases. This technique may be useful for large tumors with a primary blood supply from the external carotid since it avoids the intracranial embolic risk of coils used for this purpose.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated whether polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) may be efficacious in the treatment of peripheral artery occlusive diseases, which are a major cause of morbidity in Western countries and still lack standardized treatment.\nWe investigated the effects of PDRN, a mixture of deoxyribonucleotides, in an experimental model of hind limb ischemia (HLI) in rats to stimulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A production and to avoid critical ischemia. The femoral artery was excised to induce HLI. Sham-operated on rats (sham HLI) were used as controls. Animals were treated daily with intraperitoneal PDRN (8 mg/kg) or its vehicle. Animals were euthanized at day 7, 14, and 21 after the evaluation of blood flow by laser Doppler. Dissected muscles were used to measure VEGF-A messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression, to evaluate edema, and to assess histologic damage.\nAdministration of PDRN dramatically increased VEGF mRNA throughout the study (day 14: HLI, 7 +/- 2.2 n-fold/beta-actin; HLI + PDRN, 13.3 +/- 3.8 n-fold/beta-actin; P < .0001) and protein expression (HLI, 11 +/- 3.4 integrated intensity; HLI + PDRN, 16 +/- 3.8 integrated intensity; P < .0001). The compound stimulated revascularization, as confirmed by blood flow restoration (P < .005 vs HLI + vehicle), and blunted the histologic damage and the degree of edema. PDRN did not modify VEGF-A expression and blood flow in sham HLI animals. Furthermore, the concomitant administration of 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargilxanthine (DMPX), a selective adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist, abolished the positive effects of PDRN, confirming that PDRN acts through this receptor.\nThese results led us to hypothesize a role for PDRN in treating peripheral artery occlusive diseases.",

    "abstract": "Although recognized with increasing frequency, the pathogenesis of venous aneurysms (VA) remains poorly understood. We evaluated 8 patients with 10 VA for the presence, localization and activity of metalloproteinases (MMPs).\nTissue specimens from VA (n=8), normal saphenous vein (NSV n=7) and varicose veins (VV n=7 were compared by histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Histologic sections were stained with H&E, Movats pentachrome and toluidine blue, and IHC specimens with antibodies to CD68, MMP2, MMP9, and MMP13. Protein expression and enzyme activity were determined by Western immunoblotting and zymography.\nThree of 4 patients with popliteal VA presented with edema and leg pain and the remaining patient with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The 5 popliteal VA were treated by; excision and reanastomosis (n=2) lateral venorrhaphy (n=2) and spiral saphenous vein graft (n=1). The 3 patients with 4 upper extremity VA had discomfort over a compressible mass. Two of the VA were excised and the remaining patients aneurysm ruptured spontaneously. The mesenteric VA, an incidental finding at laparotomy was excised. Thrombus was present in 2 popliteal, 1 upper extremity and in the mesenteric aneurysm. Histologically, VA and VV were characterized by fragmentation of the elastic lamellae, loss of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and attenuation of the venous wall when compared to NSV. Varicose veins and VA also demonstrated increased expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-13 in endothelial cells (ECs), SMCs and adventitial microvessels compared to NSV. Both pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 were detected by zymography in VA,VV and NSV but only MMP-2 activity was demonstrable.\nThe structural changes in the venous wall in addition to the increased expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-13 in VA compared to NSV and VV suggests a possible causal role for these MMPs in their pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The National Kidney Foundation Dialysis Outcomes and Quality Initiative recommends autogenous access for new dialysis procedures. The patient requiring hemodialysis with inadequate superficial arm veins represents a formidable challenge to the surgeon. Our objective is to describe results with an alternative access procedure, the autogenous brachial-brachial artery (ABBA) access in patients with inadequate superficial arm veins.\nOne surgeon created 163 new dialysis accesses in 122 patients during 40 consecutive months at a university hospital. There was 97% patient follow-up. All patent but diminutive superficial arm veins as judged by preoperative ultrasound were explored. Arms with inadequate veins at exploration or arms with thrombosed veins on ultrasound received either prosthetic or ABBA procedures. Upper-arm access was often staged, involving a second \"superficialization\" procedure. This is a retrospective case series based on a comprehensive medical record review. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare access patency for individual as well as multiple factors suspected or known to influence dialysis access outcomes. Society for Vascular Surgery reporting guidelines were used except where specifically noted and justified otherwise.\nOne hundred thirty-five autogenous and 28 prosthetic dialysis operations were performed. Primary patency for all access procedures at 12, 24, and 36 months was 58%, 50%, and 38%, respectively. Primary assisted patency for all access procedures at 12, 24, and 36 months was 97%, 91%, and 85%, respectively. Secondary patency at 12, 24, and 36 months was 99%, 97%, and 97%, respectively. Finally, functional patency at 12, 24, and 36 months was 71%, 67%, and 44.0%, respectively. Of the 122 patients, 70 patients received either ABBA or prosthetic access. ABBA out-performed prosthetic access in terms of primary patency (hazard ratio for prosthetic vs ABBA: 4.21 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.49, 11.91) and functional patency (hazard ratio for prosthetic vs ABBA: 6.27 95% CI: 1.24-31.72) in patients referred early. Functional patency was more likely to be compromised in elderly patients and in patients with hypercoagulable diagnoses.\nAutogenous brachial-brachial access for dialysis out-performed prosthetic access with respect to primary and functional patency in patients referred early without differences in overall complications.",

    "abstract": "Nonfunctional popliteal entrapment is due to embryologic maldevelopment within the popliteal fossa. Functional entrapment occurs in the apparent absence of an anatomic abnormality. Gastrocnemius hypertrophy has been associated with the latter. Both forms of entrapment may cause arterial injury and lower limb ischemia. This study assessed the attachment of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle in healthy occluders and healthy nonoccluders.\nProvocative tests were used to identify 58 nonoccluders and 16 occluders. Ten subjects from each group underwent magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of the popliteal fossa. The medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle attachment was assessed in the supracondylar, pericondylar, and intercondylar areas.\nIn the occluder group, significantly more muscle was attached towards the femoral midline (supracondylar), around the lateral border of the medial condyle (pericondylar), and within the intercondylar fossa.\nThe more extensive midline position of the medial head of the gastrocnemius in occluders is likely to be a normal embryological variation. Forceful contraction results in compression and occlusion of the adjacent popliteal artery. The clinical significance of these anatomic variations remains unclear. However, these new observations may provide insight for future analysis of the causes and natural history of functional compression and the potential progression to clinical entrapment.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair (EVAR) of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAA) has been shown to acutely decrease procedural mortality compared to open aortic repair (OAR). However, little is known about the effect of choice of procedure; EVAR vs OAR, or the impact of physician and institution volume on long-term survival and outcome.\nPatients hospitalized with rAAA who underwent either OAR or EVAR, were derived from the Medicare inpatient dataset (1995-2004) using ICD9 codes. We evaluated long-term survival after OAR and EVAR in the entire fee-for-service Medicare population, and then in patients matched by propensity score to create two similar cohorts for comparison with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Annual surgeon and hospital volumes of EVAR (elective and ruptured), OAR (elective and ruptured), and rAAA (EVAR and OAR) were divided into quintiles to determine if increasing volumes correlate with decreasing mortality. Predictors of survival were determined by Cox modeling.\nA total of 43,033 Medicare beneficiaries had rAAA repair: 41,969 had OAR and 1,064 had EVAR. The proportions of patients with diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, renal disease, hyperlipidemia, and cancer were statistically higher in the EVAR than in the OAR group, whereas lower extremity vascular disease was higher in the OAR group. The initial evaluation of EVAR vs OAR, prior to propensity matching, showed no statistical advantage in EVAR-survival after 90 days. The survival analysis of patients matched by propensity score showed a benefit of EVAR over OAR that persisted throughout the 4 years of follow-up (P = .0042). Perioperative and long-term survival after rAAA repair correlated with increasing annual surgeon and hospital volume in OAR and EVAR and also with rAAA experience. EVAR repair had a protective effect (HR = 0.857, P = .0061) on long-term survival controlling for comorbidities, demographics, and hospital and surgeon volume.\nWhen EVAR and OAR patients are compared using a reliable statistical technique such as propensity analysis, the perioperative survival advantage of rAAA repaired endovascularly is maintained over the long term. Institutional experience with rAAA is critical for survival after either OAR or EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Embolo/sclerotherapy is an important treatment modality for vascular malformations, but the rates and results of the complications associated with embolo/sclerotherapy are not well known. We report the incidence and outcome of soft tissue injury and neuropathy after performing embolo/sclerotherapy for congenital vascular malformations (CVMs) classified according to the Hamburg classification.\nAmong 1823 patients with CVM, 573 were treated with embolo/sclerotherapy. We retrospectively reviewed 68 patients (31 males, 37 females; mean age, 20.0 years) with soft tissue injury and 49 patients (16 males, 33 females; mean age, 21.2 years) with neuropathy. The indications for embolo/sclerotherapy for CVM were that the CVMs affected the quality of life, such as a symptomatic or trauma-prone lesion or a lesion that was impairing the function of a limb, and the lesions that were located near a life-threatening vital area, including the airway. As embolo/sclerotherapy agents, absolute or 80% ethanol, N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA), and various types of coils or contour particles were used in various combinations, either at the same time or in phases, depending on the location, severity, and extent of the CVM.\nThe incidence of soft tissue injury was 29.4% (42 of 143) for the arteriovenous shunting type and 8% (22 of 273) for the venous type. No soft tissue injuries occurred in the patients with arterial and lymphatic malformations. Of the 68 patients with soft tissue injury, 40 lesions healed with conservative management, and 28 lesions needed surgery, including escharectomy, skin graft, or amputation. The incidence of neuropathy was 10.9% (30 of 273) for the venous CVM. No neuropathy occurred in the patients with arterial malformations. Of the 49 patients with neuropathy, 42 recovered at a mean period of 5.3 months, but seven did not.\nSoft tissue injuries occurred in 11.9% of patients (68 of 573) and neuropathies occurred in 8.6% (49 of 573) after undergoing embolo/sclerotherapy. Most of these complications recovered by themselves (58.9% from soft tissue injury and 85.1% from neuropathy). Our results suggest that embolo/sclerotherapy has an acceptable incidence of soft tissue injury and neuropathy, when considering the effect that the CVM had on the quality of life before treatment, so embolo/sclerotherapy is recommended as a treatment modality for CVM.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery lesions from symptomatic patients are characterized by inflammation and neovascularization. The adipokine leptin promotes angiogenesis and activates inflammatory cells, and the leptin receptor (ob gene-encoded receptor), ObR, is expressed in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. The present study quantitatively analyzed ObR messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and immunoreactivity in carotid artery plaques from symptomatic and asymptomatic persons. Plaque angiogenesis, gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and macrophage density were also analyzed.\nCarotid endarterectomy specimens were collected from 26 patients undergoing surgery for hemispheric cerebrovascular symptoms (n = 13) or progressive asymptomatic internal carotid stenosis (n = 13). A representative sample, including part of the most active site, was collected from each lesion and evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis for ObR(long) and ObR(common) isoforms, VEGF(165), and macrophage adhesion molecule-1 (Mac-1) mRNA, and by immunohistochemistry for ObR, von Willebrand factor (vWF), and CD68 antigen expression.\nAll plaques exhibited advanced atherosclerosis (American Heart Association class IV through VI). Transcript levels were preferentially elevated in symptomatic plaques for ObR(long) (P = .0006) and ObR(common) (P = .033), with a simultaneous upregulation of VEGF(165) (P = .001) and Mac-1 mRNA expression (P = .003). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed a significant increase of ObR antigen levels (P = .011) and CD68-positive inflammatory cells (P = .049) in symptomatic plaques, whereas neovascularization, evident in all plaques, was similar in both groups (P = .7).\nThe ObR(long) and ObR(common) genes are upregulated and their protein preferentially synthesized in clinically symptomatic carotid plaques. Moreover, ObR expression is positively correlated with augmentation of gene transcripts related to macrophage density and neovascularization. These data suggest that ObR(long) and ObR(common) may be linked with histologic features of carotid plaque instability, which are associated with cerebral ischemic symptoms.",

One-hundred thirty-five limbs with PAOD (claudication, n = 19; critical limb ischemia [CLI], n = 116) were treated. Patency was evaluated by clinical examination and duplex ultrasonography. A total of 203 lesions (183 stenoses, 20 occlusions) were treated in 66 femoropopliteal and 69 infrapopliteal arterial segments. The TransAtlantic Inter-Societal Consensus (TASC) classification of the primary lesions was A in 41.5%, B in 45.2%, C in 8.2%, and D 5.1%. Mean follow-up was 16.1 +/- 9.7 months. The overall technical success rate was 96.3% and the complication rate was 8.9%. There were two (1.5%) perioperative deaths. The primary patency rate was 82.1% at 12- and 24-months in patients with claudication (femoropopliteal lesions). The 1- and 2-year results for femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal lesions in patients with CLI were: primary patency 64.4% and 51.9 %, respectively; limb salvage 84.2% and 76.9%; survival 92.6% and 88.5%. More distal lesions and TASC classification were significant independent risk factors for outcome (P < .05). Treatment of multiple segment lesions was an independent predictor of a favorable outcome (P = .04).\nCB-PTA is safe and feasible for the treatment of infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease, with relatively low mid-term restenosis rates compared to other endovascular treatments. However, these data cannot be extrapolated to potential outcomes for lesions >10 cm in length. Further follow-up will be necessary to evaluate the long-term results of CB-PTA.",

    "abstract": "To validate a method for determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in the seated position.\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a prevalent disorder that is associated with quality of life impairment and increased risk of a major cardiovascular event. The ABI is the initial test for screening and diagnosis of PAD. To prevent error due hydrostatic pressure, accurate measurement of the ABI requires supine patient positioning. Access to ABI measurement is limited for patients who are immobilized or unable to lie flat.\nPatients presenting to a vascular laboratory for suspected arterial disease were enrolled. Arm and ankle blood pressures were measured in the supine and seated positions. Seated ankle pressures were corrected by the following physiology-based formula: Corrected ankle pressure = Measured ankle pressure - D*(.078), where D = the vertical distance between the arm and ankle cuffs (mm). This formula equates to a correction factor of 78 mm Hg per meter distance between the arm and ankle cuffs. Corrected ankle pressure measurements were used for seated ABI calculation.\nComplete data were available for 100 patients. Mean ABI was 0.97, and 31% of patients had an ABI < or =0.9. There was excellent correlation between supine and corrected seated ankle pressure measurements (r = 0.884-0.936, P < .001). The difference between measurements was negligible (<5 mm Hg). Similarly, there was excellent correlation between supine and seated ABI measures (r = 0.936, P < .001). There was no significant difference between the supine and seated ABI measures.\nWe have developed and validated a method for determination of the ABI in the seated position which can be used to broaden availability of PAD testing. This method could also be incorporated into new technologies for ABI determination in the seated position.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic augmentation of collateral artery growth (ie, arteriogenesis) is of particular clinical interest for improving blood flow in vascular occlusive disease. Quantification of collateralization in small animal models is difficult, however, and the commonly used technique of laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) has always been criticized. Therefore, a new method, termed indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), was established for in vivo imaging of arteriogenesis in mice and compared with LDPI.\nUsing the accepted model of ligation of the left femoral artery of 45 C57BL6 mice, we determined arteriogenesis both by LDPI and ICGA, which were applied before and periodically after ligation of the left femoral artery (each group n = 7). Collateral artery growth within the hind limb was additionally verified by histologic workup.\nDetermination of flow by ICGA, as represented by maximal pixel intensity (ratio of left/right hind limb) demonstrated a drop from 0.97 +/- 0.06 before ligation to 0.11 +/- 0.12 directly after ligation, which recovered to 0.48 +/- 0.22 after 1 week, to 0.65 +/- 0.11 after 2 weeks, and to 0.59 +/- 0.22 after 3 weeks (n = 7, P < .05). Similarly, flow determined as the perfusion index (slope of pixel intensity, ratio left/right) dropped from 1.18 +/- 0.4 before ligation to 0.02 +/- 0.03 immediately after ligation but recovered to 0.08 +/- 0.01 after 1 week, to 0.17 +/- 0.01 after 2 weeks, and to 0.17 +/- 0.06 after 3 weeks (n = 7, P < .05). Quantification by LDPI demonstrated a drop from 1.06 +/- 0.06 (left/right ratio) before ligation to 0.37 +/- 0.03 immediately after ligation. In contrast to ICGA, perfusion recuperated completely within 1 week to 1.01 +/- 0.14 and tended to be even higher in the ligated than in the unligated hind limb after 2 (1.09 +/- 0.25) and 3 weeks (1.20 +/- 0.29), pointing towards limitations of this technique. Histologic analysis confirmed the significant increase in the number of collaterals. The intraindividual ratio increased from 1.0 +/- 0.05 before ligation to 1.35 +/- 0.10 at 2 weeks and 1.41 +/- 0.08 at 3 weeks after ligation (P < .05).\nOur data demonstrate that ICGA represents a potent tool for the quantification of collateral flow in small animal models. The current standard of LDPI seems to rather represent blood movements within the superficial skin but not of the entire hind limb.",

    "abstract": "The neoaortoiliac system (NAIS) has gained popularity as a durable procedure for treating aortic graft infections. However, one of the disadvantages has been a long operation that can take up to 10 hours. The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of staging the NAIS procedure with deep vein harvest a day before the aortofemoral bypass and evaluate if staging had any effect on graft patency or morbidity and mortality, or both.\nWe reviewed data for all the NAIS procedures performed for aortic graft infections at a tertiary care university hospital. The femoral popliteal veins of patients undergoing the staged NAIS were harvested a day in advance and left in situ. The next day patients underwent the prosthetic graft excision with reconstruction using the femoral popliteal veins. Patients with aortic occlusion on presentation were not candidates for vein harvest in advance and underwent a unilateral bypass with a subsequent femorofemoral bypass as a second stage.\nIn the last 8 years, 26 patients (17 men, 9 women; mean age, 62.6 +/- 8.3 years) underwent the NAIS procedure for aortic graft infections. Mean follow-up was 15.7 months. Primary assisted graft patency was 100%. There were 11 patients in the staged group and 10 patients in the nonstaged group. All the staged patients underwent vein mobilization a day before excision of aortic prosthesis. Despite undergoing a separate procedure for vein harvesting at a different time, there was no difference in total operative time (12.0 +/- 1.8 vs 11.9 +/- 2.2 hours), operative blood loss (2.6 +/- 1.2 vs 3.4 +/- 2.4 L), and requirements for transfusion for blood products (6.7 +/- 3.7 vs 6.0 +/- 5.4 U) or crystalloid (11.3 +/- 3.1 vs 10.9 +/- 2.4 L) between the staged group and nonstaged groups. One amputation occurred in each group. The perioperative mortality was 18% for the staged group and 20% for nonstaged group. The 12-month survival was 72% for staged and 70% for nonstaged NAIS. No graft-related complications were observed from the preoperative vein harvest.\nThe NAIS can be staged without compromising the efficacy of the procedure as evident by excellent long-term patency and control of the infection. By reducing the duration of the primary procedure, staging may be beneficial to both the patient and the surgeon.",

    "abstract": "Subintimal angioplasty (SIA) is being increasingly utilized to treat chronic arterial occlusions. The role of stents in SIA is currently unknown. We performed a retrospective review of selective stent use in SIA to assess outcomes and factors affecting these results.\nA retrospective review of patient information--including demographics, indications, procedures, noninvasive studies, and post-procedural events--was performed on our database for patients undergoing SIA in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. Outcomes were calculated only on technically successful SIAs using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Continuous and non-continuous data were compared using the Student t test and the z test, respectively. Survival curves were compared using log-rank testing for univariate analysis and Cox hazard-regression analysis for multivariate analysis.\nThree-hundred-sixty-eight patients (382 limbs) underwent femoral and/or popliteal SIA for critical limb ischemia or disabling claudication from December 1, 2002 through July 31, 2006. Eighty-four limbs (22%) had a stent placed, while 298 (78%) did not receive a stent. Mean follow-up was 11.7 months (range, 0-45 months). One-year primary and secondary patency for stent vs no-stent group was 50% vs 45% (P = .73) and 70% vs 78% (P = .47), respectively. One-year limb salvage rate for the stent vs no-stent group was 85% vs 90% (P = .61). At 2 years, patients receiving a stent are more likely to undergo open bypass than those without a stent (P = .06). Eighty-three patients underwent 84 SIA with stent placement. The mean number of stents for each case was 1.4 +/- 0.7. Univariate analysis revealed that previous ipsilateral bypass surgery significantly decreased 1-year patency: 35% vs 56% (P = .05). SIA performed for disabling claudication had a trend toward improved 1-year patency 58% vs 39% for critical limb ischemia (P = .09). A stent diameter > or =7 mm displayed a trend toward better patency 53% vs 37% for diameter < or =6 mm (P = .08). None of these factors proved significant with multivariate analysis.\nSelective stents placed for suboptimal results after subintimal angioplasty produce similar patency rates to primary SIA without stents. Patients receiving stents with prior lower extremity bypass surgery will have worse outcomes than those without. Use of a stent diameter < or =6 mm and indication of critical limb ischemia will likely produce worse results. It appears that other stent variables (location, number, length, and overlap) do not alter patency. Finally, selective stent use after SIA provides excellent limb salvage.",

    "abstract": "The concept of repeatedly connecting an extracorporeal blood pump to produce pancycle suprasystolic inflow pressures to ischemic limbs is introduced. Balloon catheters allow for limb isolation from the systemic circulation. In the acute phase, it is assumed that pressure is proportion to flow (Poiseuille's Law) and in the chronic phase that collateral growth is related to endothelial shear stress and wall tension. The primary objective was to establish that increased flow could be achieved through collateral circulation in animals and in man with extracorporeal limb hyperperfusion. The second objective was to develop and test an arterial access system capable of intermittent regional hyperperfusion similar in concept to intermittent hemodialysis. Finally, to demonstrate the translocation of these concepts into humans facing major limb amputation where all standard treatment options had been exhausted.\nTwelve sheep (6 hyperperfusion and 6 controls) were attached to a cardiac vortex pump and perfused at 200 mm Hg pancycle with the superficial femoral artery doubly ligated and isolated from the systemic circulation with a balloon catheter. Pressure transducers measured carotid and distal femoral pressures and the carotid-femoral index was calculated. To allow hyperperfusion to be repeated transcutaneously, a peripheral access system (PAS [Allvascular, St Leonards, New South Wales, Australia]) was constructed. This device was implanted in the common carotid artery in 8 sheep and opened approximately 3 days a week for continuous arterial access up to 37 days for 67 openings. To demonstrate these principles in humans, 3 patients with critically ischemic limbs were hyperperfused intermittently. Digital thermography compared the other limb as controls and provided objective evidence of the vascular changes.\nThe mean carotid-femoral index was 0.6 +/- 0.01 for controls compared with 1.1 +/- 0.28 for the hyperperfusion group (P < .001).

    "abstract": "It is not uncommon for all usual upper limb autogenous access sites to fail, often in patients for whom neither peritoneal dialysis nor transplantation is an appropriate option. Axillary-axillary arteriovenous bypass grafts could be used as the last option before a thigh autogenous access even in case of unilateral central venous stenosis or obstruction. We describe our experience with this procedure in a series of patients.\nA consecutive series of 18 patients for whom all possible arm accesses had failed and neither peritoneal dialysis nor transplantation was possible underwent a necklace graft formation over a 2.5-year period. All grafts implanted were 6 mm, internally reinforced prostheses made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Gore-Tex Intering Vascular Graft, W. L. Gore and Associates, Inc, Flagstaff, Ariz) anastomosed end to side the axillary artery and contralateral vein, and tunneled straight in the subcutaneous space before the sternum. All patients had bimonthly clinical examinations in which the thrill, bruit, skin, cannulation sites, and dialysis adequacy were reviewed. They also had at the same time a transonic assessment where graft flows and recirculation rates were measured. In case of low flow (<600 mL/min) or drop of 20% between two measurements or recirculation >5% a fistulogram was obtained, and an intervention was performed to restore patency.\nWe operated on 10 males and 8 females; mean age was 55.1 years. The primary patency was 83% and 72.2%, and the secondary patency was 94.4% and 88.9% at 6 months and 1 year, respectively. Five successful surgical revisions were carried out for four clotted grafts and one post dialysis rupture. One surgical revision for thrombosis failed and one local infection lead to thrombosis and was not amenable to surgical revision. Three patients died of causes unrelated to their vascular access during the study period.\nThe reasonable patency and minimal complications associated with these bypasses show that they are a valid option for complex patients. We advocate the use of this bypass in patients with exhaustion of all access possibilities in both arms with a patent superior vena cava, subclavian, and brachiocephalic veins. We also indicate it in case of unilateral central venous stenosis or obstruction with complete exhaustion of all other access possibilities on the contralateral side.",

    "abstract": "Aortoiliac occlusive disease may preclude retrograde thoracic endovascular aortic repair. This study evaluated the physiologic and anatomic feasibility of introducing an aortic endograft in an antegrade manner into the descending thoracic aorta of a pig through the left ventricular apex.\nTwelve adult pigs were to undergo antegrade endograft deployment. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a stiff guidewire was introduced past the aortic valve and into the distal abdominal aorta through the left ventricular apex on a beating heart. An 18F introducer sheath containing a 24 x 36-mm aortic endograft was introduced and deployed in the descending thoracic aorta. The accuracy of graft delivery was determined at necropsy by measuring the distance from the trailing edge of the graft to the downstream margin of the ostium of the left subclavian artery. Aortic valve competency was assessed angiographically and at necropsy. Left ventricular function was assessed angiographically. Five hemodynamic and respiratory variables were recorded at 12 stages during the procedure and assessed for significant changes from baseline.\nOne animal died during the sternotomy. All remaining pigs survived the experiment with minimal hemodynamic support. A significant drop in systolic blood pressure (75 +/- 2 to 60 +/- 4 mm Hg, P = .05) was noted when the aortic valve was crossed with an 18F sheath. The systolic blood pressure returned to baseline on endograft deployment and at the end of the procedure. Bradycardia was noted at several stages of the procedure, requiring treatment in two pigs. Eleven endografts were deployed; seven grafts were delivered within 5 mm and three grafts within 10 to 20 mm of the intended landing point. One graft was deployed 10 mm too proximally, covering the left subclavian artery. No aortic valvular insufficiency or left ventricular dysfunction was noted.\nAn aortic endograft can be delivered in an antegrade manner transapically into the descending thoracic aorta in a pig model with a reasonable degree of accuracy and minimal hemodynamic compromise.",

Patients with acute mesenteric ischemia or median arcuate ligament syndrome were excluded. Mortality, recurrent stenosis, and symptomatic recurrence were analyzed using logistic regression, and univariate and multivariate analysis.\nWe identified 80 patients (69% women, 31% men). Mean age was 64 years (range, 31-86 years). Acute-on-chronic symptoms were present in 26%. Presenting symptoms included postprandial pain (91%), weight loss (69%), and food fear and diarrhea (25%). Preoperative imaging demonstrated severe (>70%) stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery in 75 patients (24 occluded), the celiac axis in 63 (20 occluded), and the inferior mesenteric artery in 53 (20 occluded). Multivessel disease was present in 72 patients (90%), and 40 (50%) underwent multivessel reconstruction. Revascularization was achieved by endarterectomy in 37 patients, mesenteric bypass in 29, and combined procedures in 14. Concurrent aortic reconstruction was required in 13 patients (16%). Three hospital deaths occurred (3.8%). Mean follow-up was 3.8 years (range, 0-17.2 years). One- and 5-year survival was 92.2% and 64.5%.

Univariate (UVA) and multivariate analyses (MVA) of demographic, clinical, anatomic, and procedural variables were conducted to discover possible predictors of serious adverse events for the whole group and for the TAG and open cohort groups separately. Early adverse outcomes occurred within 30 days or the initial hospitalization. P value of < or = .05 was significant.\nA total of 140 TAG and 94 open descending thoracic aneurysm (DTA) patients were analyzed, consisting of 128 men and 106 women.

Multivariate analysis showed predictors of death for all patients were symptomatic aneurysms and male gender. Analysis of a combined morbidity/mortality endpoint (stroke/paralysis/MI/death) showed elevated creatinine predicted these events for the whole group. Open surgery (P < .001) and increasing aneurysm diameter (P < .001) predicted an increased likelihood of any major adverse event.

Women were noted to have longer procedure times for both TAG and open repairs.\nElevated creatinine levels and symptomatic aneurysms predict morbidity and mortality, respectively, regardless of repair type. Male gender predicted death after open surgery, and since most deaths (9 of 12) were in this group, male gender predicted death overall, despite women's more difficult endovascular TAA repairs as evidenced by longer procedure times and higher vascular complication rates.

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with systemic impaired flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and increased risk for cardiovascular events. Decreased FMD may be caused by a decrease in arterial shear stress due to claudication and inflammation due to muscle ischemia and reperfusion. We assumed that endovascular revascularization of lower limb arterial obstructions ameliorates FMD and lowers inflammation through improvement of peripheral perfusion.\nThe study was a prospective, open, randomized, controlled, single-center follow-up evaluation assessing the effect of endovascular revascularization on brachial artery reactivity (FMD) measured by ultrasound, white blood cell (WBC) count, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and fibrinogen. We investigated 33 patients (23 men) with chronic and stable PAD (Rutherford 2 to 3) due to femoropopliteal obstruction. Variables were assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks in 17 patients (group A) who underwent endovascular revascularization and best medical treatment, and in 16 patients (group B) who received best medical treatment only.\nFMD did not differ between group A and B (4.96% +/- 1.86% vs 4.60% +/- 2.95%; P = .87) at baseline. It significantly improved after revascularization in group A (6.44% +/- 2.88%; P = .02) compared with group B at 4 weeks of follow-up (4.53% +/- 3.17%; P = .92), where it remained unchanged. The baseline ankle-brachial index (ABI) was similar for group A and B (0.63 +/- 0.15 vs 0.66 +/- 0.10; P = .36). At 4 weeks of follow-up, ABI was significantly increased in group A (1.05 +/- 0.15; P = .0004) but remained unchanged in group B (0.62 +/- 0.1). WBC counts of the two groups were comparable at baseline (group A: 7.6 +/- 2.26 x 10(6)/mL and group B: 7.8 +/- 2.02 x 10(6)/mL, P = .81). In group A, the leukocyte count significantly decreased after angioplasty from 7.6 +/- 2.26 to 6.89 +/- 1.35 x 10(6)/mL (P = .03). For group B, WBC count did not differ significantly compared with baseline (7.76 +/- 2.64 x 10(6)/mL; P = .94). No effects were observed on hs-CRP or fibrinogen from endovascular therapy.\nEndovascular revascularization with reestablishment of peripheral arterial perfusion improves FMD and reduces WBC count in patients with claudication. Revascularization may therefore have clinical implications beyond relief of symptoms, for example, reducing oxidative stress caused by repeated muscle ischemia or increased shear stress due to improved ambulatory activity.",

    "abstract": "The importance of wound cytokine function in chronic venous leg ulcers remains poorly understood. This study evaluated the relationship between local and systemic concentrations of wound cytokines and wound healing in patients with chronic venous ulceration.\nThis prospective observational study was set in a community- and hospital-based leg ulcer clinic. Consecutive patients with chronic leg ulceration and ankle-brachial pressure index >0.85 were prospectively investigated. All patients were treated with multilayer compression bandaging. Wound fluid and venous blood samples were collected at recruitment and 5 weeks later. In the wound fluid and venous blood, cytokines and factors reflecting the processes of inflammation (interleukin 1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), proteolysis (matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9), angiogenesis (basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF], vascular endothelial growth factor), and fibrosis (transforming growth factor-beta(1) [TGFbeta(1)]) were measured. Ulcer healing was assessed using digital planimetry at both assessments.\nThe study comprised 80 patients (43 men, 37 women). Median (range) ulcer size reduced from 4.4 (0.1-142.4) cm(2) to 2.2 (0-135.5) cm(2) after 5 weeks (P < .001; Wilcoxon signed rank), although 17 of 80 ulcers increased in size. The volume of wound fluid collected strongly correlated with ulcer size (Spearman rank = 0.801, P < .01). Initial wound fluid concentrations of bFGF correlated with ulcer size (Pearson coefficient = 0.641, P < .01), and changes in wound fluid TGFbeta(1) concentrations inversely correlated with changes in ulcer size (Spearman rank = -0.645, P = .032). There were no significant correlations between changes in other factors and ulcer healing. Wound fluid and serum cytokine concentrations correlated poorly.\nWound fluid collection volume correlates with ulcer size. Ulcer healing correlated with increased concentrations of TGFbeta(1), possibly reflecting increased fibrogenesis in the proliferating wound. Aside from this, there was a large variation in wound and serum cytokine levels that largely limits their usefulness as markers of healing.",

Proportions and trends were analyzed by chi(2) analysis, continuous variables by t test, and trends by the Cochran-Armitage test.\nDuring the study period, hospitalizations with the diagnoses of rAAA declined from 23.2 to 12.8 per 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries (P < .0001), as did repairs of rAAA (15.6 to 8.4 per 100,000; P < .0001). No change was observed in AAA elective repairs. The 30-day mortality rate after open repair of rAAA decreased by 4.9% (from 39.6% to 34.7%; P = .0007 for trend) for the age group 65 to 74 and by 2.4% (from 52.9% to 50.5%, P = .0008) for the age group > or =75. Perioperative mortality after endovascular repair diminished by 13.6% (from 43.5% in 2001 to 29.9% in 2006; P = .0020). Mortality among women was higher than among men (51.1% vs 40.0% in 2006). The demographics of patients treated for rAAA changed to include a greater proportion of women and patients aged > or =75 years.\nA significant decrease has occurred in the number of patients who have a diagnosis of rAAA and undergo treatment, but there has been no change in repairs of AAA.

A \"crescent sign\" or localized areas with higher attenuation in the thrombus were interpreted as signs of bleeding in the thrombus. A localized area of hyperattenuation did not have the typical crescent shape and was distinguished from calcifications in the thrombus. We measured the attenuation in Hounsfield units in the intraluminal thrombus using CT software to quantify the presence of blood in the thrombus. As controls, we analyzed 36 patients with intact AAA and a comparable aneurysm diameter and age.\nThe crescent sign was more frequent in the ruptured group (38% vs 14%, P = .02), but there was no significant difference in the presence of localized areas of hyperattenuation in the two groups. The attenuation in the thrombus was significantly higher in patients with rupture than in those with intact aneurysms (P = .02). The site of rupture could be localized in 29/42 patients. Ruptures occurred both through the thrombus-covered and the thrombus free wall. In 45% of the patients, the rupture site was localized in the left lateral wall, in 24% in the anterior wall, in 24% in the right lateral wall, but only in 7% in the posterior wall.\nThe site of rupture could be identified in a majority of cases of AAA with routine multislice CT. This study demonstrates an association between the presence of blood in the thrombus as suggested by higher attenuation levels and a crescent sign and AAA rupture. If these findings also predict AAA rupture, remains to be established.",

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of cognitive training on technical performance of inexperienced subjects on a commercially available VR simulator (VIST, Vascular Intervention Simulation Trainer, Mentice, Gothenburg, Sweden).\nForty-seven subjects treated an identical virtual iliac artery stenosis endovascularly. Surgical trainees without endovascular experience were allocated to two training protocols: group A(1) (n = 10) received a 45 minute didactic session followed by an expert demonstration of the procedure that included error-based learning, whereas group A(2) (n = 10) was only given a demonstration of an iliac dilation and stent procedure. All trainees performed the intervention immediately following the expert demonstration. Twenty-seven endovascular physicians were recruited (>100 endovascular interventions). Performance was assessed using the quantitative (procedure and fluoroscopy time) and qualitative (stent/vessel ratio and residual stenosis) assessment parameters recorded by the simulator.\nThe end-product (qualitative metrics) in the cognitive-skills group A(1) was similar to those of the endovascular physicians, though A(2) performed significantly worse than the physicians (group B): stent/vessel ratio (A(1) 0.89 vs B 0.96, P = .960; A(2) 0.66 vs B 0.96, P = .001) and residual stenosis (A(1) 11 vs B 4%, P = .511; A(2) 35 vs B 4%, P < .001). Group A(1) took longer to perform the procedure (A(1) 982 vs B 441 seconds, P < .001), with greater use of fluoroscopy than group B (A(1) 609 vs B 189 seconds, P < .001) whereas group A(2) performed the intervention as quickly as group B (A(2) 358 vs B 441 seconds, P = .192) but used less fluoroscopy (A(2) 120 vs 189 seconds, P = .002).\nCognitive-skills training significantly improves the quality of end-product on a VR endovascular simulator, and is fundamental prior to assessment of inexperienced subjects.",

    "abstract": "To determine the association between daily ambulatory activity patterns and exercise performance in patients with intermittent claudication.\nOne hundred thirty-three patients limited by intermittent claudication participated in this study. Patients were assessed on their ambulatory activity patterns for 1 week with a small, lightweight step activity monitor attached to the ankle using elastic velcro straps above the lateral malleolus of the right leg. The step activity monitor recorded the number of strides taken on a minute-to-minute basis and the time spent ambulating. Patients also were characterized on ankle-brachial index (ABI), ischemic window (IW) after a treadmill test, as well as initial claudication distance (ICD), and absolute claudication distance (ACD) during treadmill exercise.\nThe patient characteristics (mean +/- SD) were as follows: ABI = 0.71 +/- 0.23, IW = 0.54 +/- 0.72 mm Hg.min.meter(-1), ICD = 236 +/- 198 meters, and ACD = 424 +/- 285 meters. The patients took 3366 +/- 1694 strides/day, and were active for 272 +/- 103 min/day. The cadence for the 30 highest, consecutive minutes of each day (15.1 +/- 7.2 strides/min) was correlated with ICD (r = 0.316, P < .001) and ACD (r = 0.471, P < 0.001), and the cadence for the 60 highest, consecutive minutes of each day (11.1 +/- 5.4 strides/min) was correlated with ICD (r = 0.290, P < .01) and ACD (r = 0.453, P < .001). Similarly, the cadences for the highest 1, 5, and 20 consecutive minutes, and the cadence for the 30 highest, nonconsecutive minutes all were correlated with ICD and ACD (P < .05). None of the ambulatory cadences were correlated with ABI (P > .05) or with ischemic window (P > .05).\nDaily ambulatory cadences are associated with severity of intermittent claudication, as measured by ACD and ICD, but not with peripheral hemodynamic measures.",

    "abstract": "Arterial stenting across joints is not recommended because of increased risk of in-stent focal neointimal hyperplasia and compression or fracture of the stent by joint motion with decreased long-term patency. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of placing stents in the venous system across the inguinal ligament.\nFrom 1997 to 2006, 177 limbs with chronic non-malignant obstructive lesions had stents placed in the iliofemoral venous outflow across the inguinal ligament into the common femoral vein. Transfemoral venograms and duplex ultrasound scans to assess cumulative patency rates, cumulative rates, site of in-stent restenosis (ISR), and structural integrity of the stents were performed during follow-up. The results were compared to the findings in 316 limbs with stents terminating cephalad to the inguinal ligament.\nOverall cumulative secondary patency (CSP) rate at 54 months was greater in the limbs with cephalad than in those caudad stent termination in relation to the inguinal ligament (95% and 86%, respectively; P = .0001). Although CSP of limbs with non-thrombotic obstruction was 100% regardless of the site of stent termination, that of the limbs stented for thrombotic obstruction was greater for stents terminating cephalad than for those caudad to the ligament (90% and 84%, respectively; P = .0378). However, a comparison of CSP rates between limbs treated for thrombotic occlusion and those with thrombotic non-occlusive obstruction at 32 months revealed no difference whether or not the stent was placed across the inguinal ligament (occlusion 77% and 77%, P = .7540, non-occlusive obstruction 96% and 95%, P = .7437). Severe ISR (> or =50%) were rare, 5%. The cumulative rate was, however, not significantly different in limbs stented cephalad and caudad to the inguinal ligament (7% and 11%, respectively, P = .6393). Focal in-stent recurrent stenosis at the site of the inguinal ligament occurred in only 7% of limbs (all <50%). None of the braided stainless steel stents were compressed or fractured.\nContrary to arterial stenting, braided stainless stents can be safely placed in the venous system across the inguinal crease with no risk of stent fractures, narrowing due to external compression, focal development of severe in-stent restenosis, and no effect on long-term patency. The patency rate is not related to the length of stented area or the placement of the stent across the inguinal ligament, but is dependent upon the etiology and whether the treated postthrombotic obstruction is occlusive or non-occlusive.",

    "abstract": "The presence of a high ankle-brachial index (ABI) is related to stiff ankle arteries due to medial calcification. Recently, this condition has attracted new interest after reports of a worse cardiovascular prognosis, similar to a low ABI. We sought to compare risk factors contributing to a low (< or =0.90) and high (> or =1.40) ABI. Additionally, we hypothesized that in instances of high ABI, occlusive PAD may coexist.\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted at vascular laboratories in a university medical center. The subjects were 510 ambulatory patients (37% had diabetes) previously examined at our vascular laboratories and who responded positively to our invitation. We collected data on smoking, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease history. The noninvasive assessment of lower limb arteries consisted of the measurement of ABI, toe-brachial index (TBI), and posterior tibial artery peak flow velocity (Pk-PT). A TBI >0.7 and a Pk-PT >10 cm/s were considered normal.\nHigh- and low-ABI were detected, respectively, in 2.1% and 57.8% of limbs. For a low ABI, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.29/10 y), pack-years (OR, 1.08/10 units), and hypertension (OR, 1.90) were independent significant (P < .001) factors. A strong association was found between diabetes and high ABI (OR, 16.0; P < .001). When ABI ranges were compared with TBI and Pk-PT results, those with ABI < or =0.90 and ABI > or =1.40 presented similar patterns of abnormalities. Pk-PT or TBI, or both, was abnormal in more than 80% of cases in both ABI < or =0.90 and > or =1.40 groups. The ABI vs TBI relationship appeared linear in nondiabetic patients, but had an inverted J-shape in diabetic patients, suggesting high ABI masked leg ischemia.\nDiabetes is the dominant risk factor for a high (> or =1.40) ABI. Occlusive PAD is highly prevalent in subjects with high ABI, and these subjects should be considered as PAD-equivalent.",

Percutaneous balloon angioplasty/stenting (PTA/S) and above knee femoropopliteal bypass (AK-FPB) using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) for these lesions were compared to determine if graft type should be part of the TASC-II recommendations for the treatment of TASC C lesions.\nConsecutive patients who underwent AK-FPB with PTFE, or PTA/S for TASC-II C (PTA/S-C) or D (PTA/S-D) SFA lesions between June 2001 and April 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary end points were primary, assisted-primary, and secondary patency rates.\nIn 127 patients (mean age, 68.7 +/- 10.0 years; median, 68; range, 49-97), 139 limbs were treated (46 AK-FPB, 49 PTA/S-C, 44 PTA/S-D). The mean occlusion and stented lengths were 9.9 +/- 3.8 and 24.3 +/- 6.6 cm (median, 10 and 20 cm) in PTA/S-C, and 26.6 +/- 5.5 and 30.0 +/- 5.2 cm (median, 26 and 29 cm) in PTA/S-D. Technical success was 84% in PTA/S-D and 100% in other groups. Mean follow-up was 26.4 +/- 18.0 months (median, 24).

Secondary patency was 98% +/- 3% and 98% +/- 3% for PTA/S-C; 72 % +/- 7% and 54% +/- 11% for PTA/S-D, and 81% +/- 6% and 78% +/- 7% for AK-FPB. Secondary patency was significantly better in PTA/S-C than AK-FPB (P = .003) and PTA/S-D groups (P < .001). The difference was marginally better in AK-FPB than in PTA/S-D (P = .064).\nPTA/S for TASC-II C lesions has a superior midterm patency than AK-FPB using PTFE, and AK-FPB with PTFE has better primary and assisted-primary patency than PTA/S-D. The TASC-II recommendations should be modified to recommend treatment of SFA TASC-II C lesions by PTA/S rather than PTFE bypass for all patients. PTA/S of TASC-II D lesions should only be considered in high-risk patients who cannot tolerate a bypass procedure using PTFE.",

    "abstract": "Endosaphenous laser ablation is used in the treatment of great saphenous vein insufficiency with various methods, with and without surgical interruption. However, its mode of action and indications are not yet clear.\nTo verify the mode of action of endosaphenous laser ablation by duplex ultrasound (DUS) follow-up, with the support of histologic observations of eight cases, 44 of 182 affected limbs (CEAP C2 to C6) were selected for intravenous laser ablation of the great saphenous vein. Saphenofemoral junction incompetence was treated by surgical interruption. An 808-nm diode laser (Eufoton, Trieste, Italy) was used (variable pull-back velocity, 1 to 3 mm/s; power, 12 to 15 W; energy, 30 to 40 J/cm). In eight limbs the venous fragments were studied under light microscopy at 5 minutes and after 1 and 2 months. In 44 limbs DUS and clinical examinations were performed from 7 days to 1, 2, 6, and 12 months.\nVariously organized thrombi containing necrotic inclusions and patent areas were observed in the vein lumen. Neither neovascularization nor thrombus extension were detected at the groin by DUS examination. Progressive venous diameter decrease and thrombus fibrotic transformation up to the hypotrophic venous disappearance at 12 months were followed up (P < .00001). Not occluded (18.8%), recanalized short segments (22.7%), two entirely recanalized saphenous veins with varicose recurrence (4.5%), and postoperative phlebitis (13.6%) were observed. Nonocclusions and phlebitis prevailed in the larger veins (P < .05).\nThe healing process is based on vein thrombosis, fibrosis, and venous atrophy. Saphenofemoral interruption makes venous occlusion easier and prevents potential thrombotic complications and recurrence by recanalization. DUS monitoring makes possible to follow-up the thrombus involution and perform early retreatment. The 808-nm endosaphenous laser should be mainly applied to veins of <10 mm in diameter.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic coarctation is uncommon and often complicated with coexisting splanchnic and renal artery occlusive disease. This study was undertaken to define the clinical and anatomic characteristics of this entity, as well as the technical issues and outcomes of its operative treatment.\nFifty-three patients, 34 males and 19 females, underwent surgical treatment of abdominal aortic coarctations from 1963-2008 at the University of Michigan. Patient ages in years ranged from 2-4 (n = 4), 5-8 (n = 17), 9-14 (n = 16), 15-20 (n = 11) and 25-49 (n = 5). The mean age was 11.9 years. Developmental disease (n = 48), inflammatory aortitis (n = 4), and iatrogenic trauma (n = 1) were suspected etiologies. Aortic coarctations were suprarenal (n = 37), intrarenal (n = 12), or infrarenal (n = 4). Patients often had coexisting occlusive disease of the splanchnic (n = 33) and renal (n = 46) arteries.\nMajor clinical manifestations included: aortic and renal artery-related secondary hypertension (n = 50), symptomatic lower extremity ischemia (n = 3), and intestinal angina (n = 3). Primary aortic reconstructive procedures included: thoracoabdominal bypass (n = 26), patch aortoplasty (n = 24), or an aortoaortic interposition graft (n = 3). Primary splanchnic (n = 19) or renal (n = 47) arterial reconstructions were performed as simultaneous (n = 45) or staged (n = 13) procedures in relation to the aortic surgery. Benefits existed regarding improved control of hypertension (n = 46), as well as elimination of extremity ischemia (n = 3) and mesenteric angina (n = 3). Secondary renal or splanchnic arterial reoperations (n = 8) were performed without mortality 5 days to 12 years postoperative for failed primary procedures. Secondary aortic procedures, 5 to 14 years postoperative, were performed for patch aortoplasties that became stenotic (n = 2) or aneurysmal (n = 1), and when thoracoabdominal bypasses developed an anastomotic narrowing (n = 1) or proved inadequate in size with patient growth (n = 1). No perioperative mortality accompanied either the primary or secondary aortic reconstructive procedures.\nAbdominal aortic coarctation represents a complex vascular disease. Individualized treatment changed little over the period of study, remaining dependent on the pattern of anatomic lesions, patient age, and anticipated growth potential. This experience documented salutary outcomes exceeding 90% following carefully performed operative therapy.",

The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes of our series of patients who underwent redo VAP aneurysm open surgery (conventional group) with a selected group of high-risk patients who underwent, in the same time period from 2001-2007, an alternative hybrid surgical and endovascular approach (hybrid group).\nConventional group: Twelve patients (11 males, median age 71.5 years, range, 65 to 77 years) underwent VAP aneurysm (median maximum diameter 62 mm, range, 52 to 75 mm) repair with re-inclusion technique via redo thoracophrenolaparotomy or bilateral subcostal laparotomy. Reimplantation of a single undersized VAP or separate revascularization of one or more visceral arteries was performed. Hybrid group: Seven patients (5 males, median age 70 years, range, 63 to 78 years) defined as at high risk for conventional surgery having American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class 3 or 4 associated with a preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <50% or an ejection fraction <40%, underwent VAP aneurysm (median maximum diameter 73 mm, range, 62 to 84 mm) repair via median laparotomy, visceral arteries rerouting, and VAP aneurysm exclusion using commercially available thoracic aortic endografts.\nConventional group: Perioperative mortality was 16.7% and major morbidity 33.3%. One perioperative anuria was successfully treated with bilateral renal artery stenting. No paraplegia or paraparesis were observed. At a median follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 1.6-7 years), we observed one case of peri-graft fluid collection with sepsis at postoperative day 46 requiring surgical drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy and one case of renal failure at day 68 requiring permanent hemodialysis. Hybrid group: perioperative mortality was 14.3% and major morbidity 28.6% with one case of transient delayed paraplegia. At a median follow-up of 1.9 years (range, 0.3-6.8 years), we observed one case of late pancreatitis (46 days postoperatively) resolved with pharmacologic treatment and one death due to an acute visceral grafts thrombosis (78 days postoperatively). We did not observe other procedure-related deaths or complications, VAP aneurysm growth, endoleak, and endograft migration.\nHybrid repair is clearly a feasible alternative to simple observation for patients unfit for redo VAP aneurysm open surgery. However, despite our promising early results, new mid-term specific procedure-related complications have been observed and a widespread use of this technique should be currently limited until longer-term follow-up is available.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) contribute to vascular regeneration. Since surgical injury and burns induce a pro-inflammatory and proangiogenic response, we investigated the effect of vascular injury with minimal surgical trauma after endarterectomy on the number of circulating EPC and systemic inflammatory changes.\nForty-five patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease were included in the study. Venous blood samples were taken before and 1 day after endarterectomy and plaque material was obtained. Ten patients with minor surgery served as controls. Circulating CD133+CD34+, VEGFR-2+CD34+ progenitor cells and surface expression of CD11b on circulating neutrophils were analysed using flow cytometry. EPCs were characterized in a culture assay as double-positive for DiI-LDL uptake and lectin binding. Cytokine concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1ss, IL-10, IL-12, SDF-1, G-CSF, and VEGF were measured in plasma and tissue samples. After endarterectomy a significant decrease in circulating EPC, CD133+CD34+, and VEGFR-2+CD34+ cells was observed. This was associated with a specific pattern of changes in circulating cytokine levels after endarterectomy with a decrease in IL-1 beta and IL-12, an increase in IL-6 and G-CSF plasma concentrations, and surface expression of CD11b on circulating neutrophils. In contrast, after minor surgery an increase in circulating CD133+CD34+ cells, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 was found. Interestingly there was a negative association between levels of local IL-6 within the plaque and only the preoperative levels of circulating CD133+C34+.\nEndarterectomy induces changes in circulating cytokines and a decline in circulating progenitor cells, which may be due to recruitment of progenitor cells to the injured vessels. This is supported by the negative association between plaque inflammation and circulating progenitor cells before endarterectomy.",

The experimental study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of stent grafts (S/Gs) with slow release of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) for the organization.\nThe S/Gs were constructed of self-expanding Z stent covered with expanded polytetra fluoroethylene graft, and coated with elastin to be able to bind and slowly release bFGF. Five elastin-coated S/Gs with bFGF (bFGF-S/Gs) and without bFGF (C-S/Gs) were placed in the normal canine aorta respectively. The thoracic aortic aneurysm models were surgically created with a jugular vein patch in 12 beagles. S/Gs with six holes, for creating endoleaks, were used in the experiment of aneurysmal repair. The bFGF-S/Gs (n = 6) and C-S/Gs (n = 6) were implanted. The beagles were sacrificed at two weeks after the endovascular procedure and examined histologically.\nThe bFGF-S/Gs induced six times the intimal proliferation of the C-S/Gs in normal aorta. Twelve animals had successfully created aneurysms, and had endoleaks just after the endovascular procedure. At two weeks after the endovascular procedure, the percentage of fibrous area in the aneurysmal cavity treated with bFGF-S/G (35.7 +/- 4.3%) was significantly greater than C-S/G (13.6 +/- 2.2%) (P < .01).\nbFGF-S/Gs are effective for accelerating organization of the aneurysm cavity and developing neointima. Further research on bFGF-S/Gs would clarify the association of endoleaks.",

We performed a meta-analysis of comparative studies evaluating endovascular vs open repair of these injuries.\nA systematic search of studies reporting treatment of traumatic aortic injury was performed using the following databases: Medline/PubMed, CINAHL, Proquest, Up to Date, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Search terms were thoracic aortic trauma, traumatic thoracic aortic injury, traumatic aortic rupture, stent graft repair, and endovascular repair. Outcomes analyzed were procedure-related mortality, overall 30-day mortality, and paraplegia/paraparesis rate using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Publication bias was investigated using funnel plots. Assessment of homogeneity was performed using the Q test; statistical heterogeneity was considered present at P < .05. Weighted averages of age, interval to repair, and injury severity score were compared with the Welch t test; P < .05 was considered statistically significant.\nSeventeen retrospective cohort studies from 2003 to 2007 were included. All were nonrandomized; no prospective randomized trials were found. These studies reported on 589 patients; 369 were treated with open repair, and 220 underwent thoracic stent graft placement. There was no significant difference in age (mean 38.8 years for both) or interval to repair (mean 1.5 days for endoluminal repair; 1 day for open repair). Injury severity score was higher for patients undergoing endoluminal repair (mean, 42.4 vs 37.4 for open repair, P < .001). Procedure-related mortality was significantly lower with endoluminal repair (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.15-0.66; P = .002). Overall 30-day mortality was also lower after endoluminal repair (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.78; P = .005). Sixteen studies reported data for postoperative paraplegia; 215 patients were treated with endograft placement and 333 with open repair. The risk of postoperative paraplegia was significantly less with endoluminal repair (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.1-0.93; P = .037). The Q test did not indicate significant heterogeneity for the outcomes of interest; publication bias was limited.\nMeta-analysis of retrospective cohort studies indicates that endovascular treatment of descending thoracic aortic trauma is an alternative to open repair and is associated with lower postoperative mortality and ischemic spinal cord complication rates.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated risk factors for stroke or death after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) among hospitals of varying type and size participating in a regional quality improvement effort.\nWe reviewed 2714 patients undergoing 3092 primary CEAs (excluding combined procedures or redo CEA) at 11 hospitals in Northern New England from January 2003 through December 2007. Hospitals varied in size (25 to 615 beds) and comprised community and teaching hospitals. Fifty surgeons reported results to the database. Trained research personnel prospectively collected >70 demographic and clinical variables for each patient. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to generate odds ratios (ORs) and prediction models for the 30-day postoperative stroke or death rate.\nAcross 3092 CEAs, there were 38 minor strokes, 14 major strokes, and eight deaths (5 stroke-related) < or =30 days of the index procedure (30-day stroke or death rate, 1.8%). In multivariate analyses, emergency CEA (OR, 7.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-26.9; P = .004), contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3-6.2; P = .009), preoperative ipsilateral cortical stroke (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.1; P = .02), congestive heart failure (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4, P = .03), and age >70 (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8-2.3; P = .315) were associated with postoperative stroke or death. Preoperative antiplatelet therapy was protective (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9; P = .02). Risk of stroke or death varied from <1% in patients with no risk factors to nearly 5% with patients with > or =3 risk factors. Our risk prediction model had excellent correlation with observed results (r = 0.96) and reasonable discriminative ability (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.71). Risks varied from <1% in asymptomatic patients with no risk factors to nearly 4% in patients with contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-8.1; P = .01) and age >70 (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.0-4.9, P = .05). Two hospitals performed significantly better than expected. These differences were not attributable to surgeon or hospital volume.\nSurgeons can \"risk-stratify\" preoperative patients by considering the variables (emergency procedure, contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion, preoperative ipsilateral cortical stroke, congestive heart failure, and age), reducing risk with antiplatelet agents, and informing patients more precisely about their risk of stroke or death after CEA. Risk prediction models can also be used to compare risk-adjusted outcomes between centers, identify best practices, and hopefully, improve overall results.",

    "abstract": "This report aims to describe an effective endovascular technique to repair a stent graft collapse in the distal aortic arch. We report a case of a stent graft collapse after off-label endovascular treatment of a traumatic aortic transection using a Gore TAG endoprosthesis (oversizing 12%). The collapse was treated by off-label stent-protected angioplasty (Palmaz stent, Cordis, Miami, Fla) over a stiff guidewire, which was passed from the right femoral artery through the collapsed stent graft and out at the right brachial artery. We believe that this technique enables more precise stent deployment and is safer than the regular guidewire position in the ascending aorta.",

    "abstract": "The iliac branched device (IBD) is the only totally endovascular option to preserve flow to the internal iliac artery for the treatment of aorto-iliac or solitary iliac artery aneurysms. This technique involves the use of two parallel guide wires, including the indwelling through-and-through wire and a wire to introduce the bridging stent-graft. We describe a technique which uses \"tromboned\" sheaths (ie, a 7F ANL 1 inside a 10F Balkin sheath) for increased cross-over stability and avoids problems associated with the use of parallel wires inside one sheath. In addition, reduction of the gap between the IBD and the origin of the internal iliac artery may result in a more stable position of the device.",

    "abstract": "Most current animal models of hindlimb ischemia use acute arterial occlusion that does not accurately reflect the pathogenesis of gradual arterial occlusion in humans. We, therefore, developed the first mouse model of gradual arterial occlusion and tested the hypothesis that the mechanisms regulating blood flow recovery are critically dependent on the rate of arterial occlusion.\nGradual arterial occlusion was induced by placing ameroid constrictors on the proximal and distal left femoral artery, and ligating the femoral arterial branches (n = 36). Acute arterial occlusion was accomplished by excising the left femoral artery (n = 36). The blood flow recovery was studied by laser Doppler imaging. Differential gene expression between these two models was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCR). Inflammatory and progenitor cells recruitment were determined by immunohistochemistry.\nWe found that hypoxia-related genes increased significantly in the calf, but not in the thigh, after gradual and acute femoral arterial occlusion (P < .05). Shear-stress dependent genes and inflammatory genes were upregulated immediately in the thigh only after acute femoral arterial occlusion (P < .05). These differences in gene expression were consistent with increased SDF-1alpha expression, recruitment of macrophages and hemangiocytes, and higher blood flow recovery after acute arterial occlusion than after gradual arterial occlusion (P < .05).\nThis is the first study to show the mechanisms that regulate blood flow recovery are critically dependent on the rate of arterial occlusion. This novel model of gradual arterial occlusion may more closely resemble the human diseases, and may provide more accurate mechanistic insights for creating novel molecular therapies.",

Vacuum assisted closure (VAC) therapy has been reported to be an effective therapeutic option for LF, but the effectiveness of VAC therapy for lymphoceles is unclear.\nFor LF, we apply the VAC directly to the skin defect after extending it to achieve a clean wound of at least one inch in length. To treat lymphocele, we convert the lymphocele to a LF in a sterile fashion by making a one inch incision in the overlying skin and applying the VAC. The setting was a community teaching hospital. We used 10 patients that we treated with VAC therapy for LF (n = 4) and lymphoceles (n = 6).\nDuration of in-patient stay, duration of in-patient VAC treatment, duration of out-patient VAC treatment, total duration of VAC treatment. The median duration of in-patient stay was 4 (range, 0-18) days, the median duration of in-patient VAC treatment was 1 (range, 0-5) days, the median duration of out-patient VAC treatment was 16 (range, 7-28) days), and the median total duration of VAC therapy was 18 (range, 13-29) days. Successful wound healing was achieved in all patients with no recurrence after VAC removal. VAC therapy for treatment of both LFs and lymphoceles resulted in early control of drainage, rapid wound closure, and short hospital stays.\nOur results suggest that VAC therapy is a convenient and effective therapeutic option for both LFs and lymphoceles.",

    "abstract": "The neutrophil count has been associated with adverse cardiovascular events after percutaneous coronary intervention. There are limited data on risk stratification of patients with advanced peripheral vascular disease (PVD) using white blood cell (WBC) subtypes. This study assessed the association of total and differential WBC counts with adverse outcome in patients with advanced PVD undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).\nIn a retrospective cohort study, consecutive de novo procedures were analyzed for patients with Rutherford category 4 or 5 PVD who underwent successful nonemergency PTA. Cardiovascular risk factors, baseline total and differential WBC counts, and angiographic data were recorded. Primary outcome was a composite of events of target vessel revascularization (repeat PTA or vascular bypass operation) or lower limb amputation.\nA total of 101 patients were studied. Their mean age was 76 +/- 10 years, 54% had diabetes mellitus, 68% were hypertensive, and 12% had had previous myocardial infarction. We observed 29 events during a median period of 14 months (interquartile range, 4-26). Cox regression analysis found diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 4.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-16.14; P = .02), Rutherford category 5 (OR, 4.18; 95% CI, 1.06-16.51; P = .04), poor tibial runoff (OR, 4.42; 95% CI, 1.16-16.82; P = .03), and preprocedural neutrophil count in the third tertile (OR, 10.77; 95% CI, 2.19-52.91; P = .003) were independent predictors of outcome.\nThe results suggest that the preprocedural neutrophil count could be used in global risk factor assessment of patients with advanced PVD who are being considered for PTA. The neutrophil count may reflect the burden of atherosclerosis and tissue damage, and so could identify patients who need more aggressive intervention for advanced PVD.",

    "abstract": "Patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) are a heterogeneous population with respect to risk for mortality and limb loss, complicating clinical decision-making. Endovascular options, compared with bypass, offer a tradeoff between reduced procedural risk and inferior durability. Risk stratified data predictive of amputation-free survival (AFS) may improve clinical decision making and allow for better assessment of new technology in the CLI population.\nThis was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from patients who underwent infrainguinal vein bypass surgery for CLI. Two datasets were used: the PREVENT III randomized trial (n = 1404) and a multicenter registry (n = 716) from three distinct vascular centers (two academic, one community-based). The PREVENT III cohort was randomly assigned to a derivation set (n = 953) and to a validation set (n = 451). The primary endpoint was AFS. Predictors of AFS identified on univariate screen (inclusion threshold, P < .20) were included in a stepwise selection Cox model. The resulting five significant predictors were assigned an integer score to stratify patients into three risk groups. The prediction rule was internally validated in the PREVENT III validation set and externally validated in the multicenter cohort.\nThe estimated 1-year AFS in the derivation, internal validation, and external validation sets were 76.3%, 72.5%, and 77.0%, respectively. In the derivation set, dialysis (hazard ratio [HR] 2.81, P < .0001), tissue loss (HR 2.22, P =.0004), age >or=75 (HR 1.64, P = .001), hematocrit <or=30 (HR 1.61, P = .012), and advanced CAD (HR 1.41, P = .021) were significant predictors for AFS in the multivariable model. An integer score, derived from the ss coefficients, was used to generate three risk categories (low <or= 3 [44.4% of cohort], medium 4-7 [46.7% of cohort], high >or=8 [8.8% of cohort]). Stratification of the patients, in each dataset, according to risk category yielded three significantly different Kaplan-Meier estimates for 1-year AFS (86%, 73%, and 45% for low, medium, and high risk groups, respectively). For a given risk category, the AFS estimate was consistent between the derivation and validation sets.\nAmong patients selected to undergo surgical bypass for infrainguinal disease, this parsimonious risk stratification model reliably identified a category of CLI patients with a >50% chance of death or major amputation at 1 year. Calculation of a \"PIII risk score\" may be useful for surgical decision making and for clinical trial designs in the CLI population.",

    "abstract": "The UK Small Aneurysm Trial (UKSAT) and the American Aneurysm Detection and Management (ADAM) trial both concluded that early elective open surgery does not confer any late survival advantage in patients with small abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with diameter 4.0 to 5.5 cm. However, two trials of endovascular aneurysm repair in small AAA have started based upon speculation that a sub-group of particularly fit patients, with low operative mortality, may benefit from early intervention. Here we investigate whether the fittest patients from the UKSAT might have benefited from early intervention.\nA total of 1090 patients randomized into the UKSAT between 1991 and 1995 were followed for an average of 12 years for mortality. Baseline data were used to calculate the Customized Probability Index (CPI), a validated prognostic risk score for operative mortality after elective open aneurysm repair that assigns risk points for history of cardiac, pulmonary, and renal disease and subtracts risk points for use of statins and beta-blockers. Cox regression was used to assess any differences in all-cause or aneurysm-related mortality between policies of early surgery or surveillance across the fitness spectrum. Tests for interaction used CPI scores as a continuous variable but patients also were stratified into tertile groups for descriptive purposes. Hazard ratios were adjusted for age, gender, and aneurysm diameter.\nA total of 714 deaths (95 aneurysm-related) occurred in 8485 person-years (number of patients multiplied by average years of conditional follow-up). The mean (standard deviation [SD]) CPI score was 8.1 (9.9) with similar scores between randomized groups. The tertile groups had mean (SD) scores of -1.8 (3.7) for the 389 fittest patients, 8.8 (3.3) for the 438 moderately fit, 21.4 (6.6) for the 261 least fit with missing scores in 2 patients. The tests for interaction were non-significant for both all-cause (P = .176) and aneurysm-related mortality (.178). However, for the least fit patients a survival advantage was seen in the early surgery group; adjusted hazard ratios 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-0.96) and 0.46 (95% CI 0.22-0.98) for all-cause and aneurysm-related mortality respectively.\nEarly elective surgery did not confer any survival benefit in the fittest patients. On the contrary, the possibility of a survival benefit from early intervention in patients of poor fitness merits further investigation through meta-analysis or validation in other prospective studies.",

    "abstract": "Based on a previous randomized study showing significantly superior patency rates for in vitro endothelialized expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts we investigated whether it was feasible for a nontertiary institution to offer autologous in vitro endothelialization to all elective infrainguinal bypass patients who had no suitable saphenous vein available.\nOver a period of 15 years, 310 out of 318 consecutive nonacute patients (age 64.7 +/- 8.6) received 341 endothelialized ePTFE grafts (308 femoropopliteal: 153 above knee [AK] and 155 below knee [BK] and 33 femorodistal). Autologous endothelial cells were harvested from short segments (3.9 +/- 1.1 cm) of subcutaneous veins (80% cephalic, 11% basilic, 2% external jugular, and 7% saphenous) and grown to mass cultures within 18.9 +/- 4.5 days before being confluently lined onto fibrin glue-coated ePTFE grafts. The graft diameter was 6 mm (64%) or 7 mm (36%). The overall procedure-related delay for graft implantation was 27.6 + 7.8 days. Growth failure prevented 2.5% of patients from receiving an endothelialized graft. The mean observation period was 9.6 years. Primary patencies were obtained from Kaplan-Meier survivorship functions. Explants for morphological analysis were obtained from eight patients.\nThe overall primary patency rate of femoropopliteal grafts was 69% at 5 years (68% [AK] vs 71% [BK]) and 61% at 10 years (59% [AK] vs 64% [BK]). Primary patency of 7 mm vs 6 mm grafts was 78%/62% at 5 years and 71%/55% at 10 years. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (log rank test P = .023; Breslow test P = .017). Stage I vs II/III patients showed 5-year patencies of 67% vs 73% (N.S.) and 10-year patencies of 61%% vs 53% (N.S.). The primary patency of femorodistal grafts was 52% at 5 years and 36% at 10 years. The limb salvage rate was 94% (fempop) vs 86% (femdistal) at 5 years and 89% vs 71% at 10 years. All retrieved samples showed the presence of an endothelium after 38.9 +/- 17.8 months.\nAutologous in vitro endothelialization was shown to be a feasible routine procedure at a nontertiary hospital. Explants confirmed the presence of an endothelium years after implantation while the primary patency in the particularly challenging subgroup of patients without a suitable saphenous vein resembles that of vein grafts.",

    "abstract": "Evidence regarding the impact of prior abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair on the risk of neurological deficit after thoracic endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (TEVAR) is lacking. The purpose of this study was to characterize the risk of TEVAR-related neurological deficit in patients who previously underwent infrarenal AAA surgery.\nProspective maintained databases of patients undergoing TEVAR in the participating institutions were searched for patients with a history of prior AAA surgery before TEVAR. Patient and procedural characteristics and postoperative mortality and morbidity were subsequently centrally collected and systematically entered in a database. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed associating variables with postoperative spinal cord ischemia (SCI).\nSeventy-two patients were identified that underwent TEVAR after prior AAA repair. The risk of SCI was 12.5% (n = 9) and significantly higher than the 1.7% risk of SCI in patients without prior AAA repair (relative risk [RR] 7.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6 to 19.6, P < .0001). Symptoms of SCI completely resolved in 4 patients with prior AAA repair. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the following variables were significant predictors of SCI in patients with prior AAA repair: preoperative renal insufficiency (odds ratio [OR] 29.5; 95% CI 5.3-164, P < .001), increased length of aorta coverage by TEVAR (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.0-1.2, P .039) and a lengthened time interval between prior AAA repair and TEVAR (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.4, P .026). Preoperative renal insufficiency was also significantly associated with the risk of SCI in multivariate analysis (P .011).\nPrior infrarenal AAA repair is associated with dramatic increased risk of SCI after TEVAR compared to patients without prior AAA surgery. Preoperative renal insufficiency appears to be an important predictor of SCI after TEVAR in patients with prior AAA repair. A thorough understanding of the risk profile in patients requiring TEVAR following prior AAA surgery is essential when determining appropriate surgical recommendations. If the diameter and rupture risk are large and TEVAR is indicated, the best available care should be offered for maximal protection of the spinal cord in these patients.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this report is to succinctly review the history, evolution, and accreditation process of postgraduate surgical training programs in the United States, with emphasis on recent dramatic changes in vascular surgery training. Vascular surgery became a distinct specialty of surgery on March 17, 2005, when the American Board of Surgery (ABS) received approval from the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) to offer a Primary Certificate in Vascular Surgery. The traditional requirement for 5 years of training and certification in general surgery was eliminated. Effective July 1, 2006, the ABS converted its certificate in vascular surgery from a subspecialty certificate to a specialty (primary) certificate. These landmark changes allowed the simultaneous development of new training paradigms. Multiple flexible training pathways leading to either dual certification (Traditional 5-2; Early Specialization Program 4-2) or vascular surgery certification alone (Integrated 0-5; Independent 3-3) now exist. New pathways require a minimum of 2 years of core surgery training and 3 years of advanced vascular training. There are currently 96 accredited traditional 5-2 programs, five 4-2 programs, and 11 0-5 integrated programs, with multiple additional institutions in the process of submitting 0-5 applications. The main obstacle preventing more rapid transition to the new pathways seems to be difficulty in obtaining funding for additional resident positions. Multiple flexible training paradigms are likely to coexist as vascular surgery continues to evolve.",

    "abstract": "Vascular surgery practice and education vary widely across the globe. In Brazil, the largest and most populated country of South America, vascular surgery is an independent specialty, with >3000 practicing specialists. Vascular surgery education in Brazil consists of 6 years of medical school, followed by a 4-year residency in vascular surgery. Endovascular surgery training is provided by part-time mini-fellowships after a residency program has been completed. The author of this report, who represents the Sociedade Brasileira de Angiologia e de Cirurgia Vascular (SBACV) or Brazilian Society of Angiology and Vascular Surgery, presents the critical issues in vascular surgery education in Brazil.\nAn informal survey was conducted among residency program directors and members of the SBACV National Board to identify the critical issues in vascular surgical education in Brazil.\nThe 25 responders pointed to two issues as the most critical. The first is funding for vascular surgical education. Currently, 73 vascular residency programs are accredited, with 142 first-year positions and 288 residents in training. Vascular surgery residents are paid a meager stipend, but instructors receive no pay. Endovascular fellows have to pay for their training. This has led to endovascular training being financed by the industry, despite the potential conflicts of interest created by this situation. The second critical issue is endovascular surgery training. The vascular surgical community in Brazil faces the huge task of how to offer training in endovascular techniques to the 140 or so young vascular surgeons coming out of residency programs every year, as well as how to teach endovascular techniques to several hundred certified vascular surgeons already in practice.\nFunding vascular surgery educational programs and training surgeons in the new endovascular techniques are the critical issues faced by vascular surgical educators in Brazil.",

    "abstract": "The first department of vascular surgery in India was established in 1978, and the first training course in peripheral vascular surgery was started in 1985. Despite this, vascular surgery has been slow to develop in India. The widespread misconception that vascular diseases are uncommon and that the result of vascular reconstruction is poor has resulted in vascular surgery not being popular among the medical students. Only 10 medical colleges have dedicated vascular surgical departments; hence, most students do not have enough knowledge about vascular diseases and the treatment options. This lack of awareness has resulted in a delay in diagnosis of vascular problems that results in poor outcome. At present there are only seven training centers for vascular surgery, training 12 students every year. Students receive adequate training in open surgical procedures, but endovascular training is still inadequate. Endovascular treatment has not picked up because of the expense and nonavailability of catheterization laboratories to vascular surgeons. The Vascular Society of India (VSI) has proposed to correct these problems by starting more training centers in private hospitals, starting vascular services in different parts of the country, conducting a nationwide awareness campaign, and conducting more continuing medical education programs and workshops for the general surgical trainees. VSI has been conducting endovascular workshops for the vascular trainees and has arranged for fellowships abroad in reputed vascular units. VSI is looking forward to having active interaction with World Federation of Vascular Societies to create more training opportunities for the young vascular surgeons.",

    "abstract": "In 1958, the Union Europ\u00e9ene des M\u00e9decins Sp\u00e9cialistes (UEMS), or European Union (EU) of Medical Specialists the European Union, was founded by the professional organizations of medical specialists in Europe. Among the objectives of the UEMS are to promote the highest level of patient care in the EU and to promote the harmonization of high-quality training programs within the various specialities throughout the EU. Within the 38 Specialist Sections of the UEMS are the European Boards, which are the working groups of the Specialist Sections. In 2005 Vascular Surgery was recognized as a separate and independent Section, a monospecialty, within the UEMS. The efforts of the UEMS are directed at facilitating the free exchange of training and work of trainees and medical specialists between EU countries. This situation, in combination with large differences in requirements and length of training in vascular surgery within the EU, stresses the importance of harmonization in training and certification in vascular surgery within the EU. For that reason, the European Board of Vascular Surgery has organized voluntary examinations yearly since 1996. The candidates who pass qualify as \"Fellow of the European Board of Vascular Surgery\" (FEBVS) since 2005. The first part of the examination evaluates the eligibility of the candidate (Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training, training center, logbook). The second part is a viva voce assessment that includes (1) case analyses, (2) a review of a scientific article, (3) an overall assessment, (4) a technical skills, and (5) an endovascular skills assessment. To pass the examination, the candidates must achieve a 67% success rate in each part of the examination. During the last 10 years, approximately 75% of the candidates have successfully taken the examination. In the near future the Section and Board, in close collaboration with the vascular societies in the EU, will develop a European vascular surgical syllabus and curriculum that will further harmonize and professionalize the training and certification of vascular surgery in Europe.",

Trainees in vascular surgery need to be competent in open vascular surgery and in performing and interpreting vascular ultrasound imaging. They must also master a full range of endovascular procedures, including cannulation of arteries, and angioplasty and stenting procedures, and endoluminal repair of aneurysms with stent grafting. Applicants complete a rigorous selection process and are ranked nationally. Training is started in postgraduate year 3 or at any time beyond that. The 5-year program is the competency-based surgical education training (SET) program. The trainees sit an examination at the end of the SET 1 and also an exit examination in SET 5. Before the final examination, the trainees must have performed 400 major cases as primary operators and 150 peripheral percutaneous interventions. In addition they must satisfy the requirements of the on-line in-service examinations and show adequate ultrasound case volumes and completion of research projects.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease is a significant problem worldwide. In developing countries such as India, the increased incidence of smoking and other forms of nicotine intake has resulted in a large proportion of young individuals with Buerger's disease. The results of surgical and endovascular treatment for this condition have not been very rewarding. Hence, we focused on providing alternative therapies. Neovascularization by autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell transplantation is being tried as an alternative therapeutic option. We have reviewed our series of patients who underwent autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell transplantation during the last 2 years.\nWe enrolled 38 patients who were chosen to undergo autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell transplantation for nonreconstructible Buerger's disease. We injected the bone marrow mononuclear cells into the calf muscles of the affected limbs in 36 patients. We monitored ulcer healing, ankle-brachial index (ABI), and transcutaneous oximetry (TcPo(2)) level.\nNo procedurally related complications occurred, although one injected sample of bone marrow aspirate later revealed infestation with Strongyloides stercoralis. Two patients were seropositive on the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test and were not injected with the bone marrow mononuclear cells. Three patients (12%) underwent major amputations </=6 months. The others had improvements in their ulcer healing, an increase in the mean ABI of 0.14 (range, 0.1-0.19; P < .01), and improvement in the mean TcPo(2) of 52 mm Hg (range, 40-68 mm Hg, P < .01), with resultant limb salvage in all at 6 months. All patients discontinued smoking during the study period.\nUse of bone marrow-derived progenitor cell transplantation into ischemic limbs is a relatively safe procedure with no demonstrable side effects at 6 months. These study data support conducting controlled and multicenter trials to evaluate the efficacy of this therapy in preventing amputation in selected patients with Buerger's disease who have critical limb ischemia.",

    "abstract": "This study reports the initial clinical results and experience with the planning of branched stent grafts in high-risk patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs).\nHigh-risk patients with TAAAs were considered for this study. Based on evaluation with computed tomography angiography (CTA), 21 custom-made branched stent grafts were designed for the selected patients. Two patients had associated bilateral aneurysms of the common iliac arteries, so an iliac branched device was also used.\nBetween August 2006 and April 2008, 23 patients (10 women, 13 men) were selected to undergo endovascular TAAA repair. Mean age was 72 years old. Two patients were excluded after 1-mm-slice CTA analysis. Eleven patients have underdone TAAA repair so far. The mean follow-up period at present is 8 months (range, 18 days-21 months). Overall technical success was accomplished in all 11 patients. Two renal artery branches occluded. Operative times varied from 3 to 8 hours. Mean contrast volume was 193 mL (range, 48-420 mL). Eight patients required a stay of </=4 days at the intensive care unit. Three patients died. Two deaths were procedurally related: one patient died of myocardial infarction, and the other had ischemic cerebellar stroke and died 3 months later of pulmonary sepsis. The third patient was readmitted 3 days after hospital discharge and died of alcoholic pancreatitis. One man had permanent paraplegia. Two women had transitory paraparesis. Striking hematologic and systemic inflammatory abnormalities were observed.\nIncreasing reports on stent graft technology indicate that this procedure might become a reality in the future for endovascular treatment of complex aneurysms in all aortic segments. Branched stent grafts seem to be feasible and can be offered as an effective alternative to most patients with TAAAs, especially for those who are currently excluded from open surgical procedures.",

    "abstract": "In the West, stent grafts for endovascular repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms have been commercially available for several years, whereas in Japan, a manufactured stent graft was not approved for this application until March 2008. Nevertheless, endovascular thoracic intervention began to be performed in Japan in the early 1990s, with homemade devices used in most cases. Many researchers have continued to develop homemade devices. We have participated in joint design and assessment efforts with a stent graft manufacturer, focusing primarily on fenestrated stent grafts used in repairs at the distal arch, a site especially prone to aneurysm.\nFrom 1995 to February 2008, we performed about 1100 endovascular procedures to treat thoracic aortic aneurysms and 682 cases were performed at Tokyo Medical University. In 435 out of 682 the aneurysm was located in the area from the distal arch to the proximal descending aorta. Fenestrated stent grafts were inserted in 288 cases. Computed tomography scans were performed at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively and annually thereafter.\nThe initial success rate in the entire series was 95.2%. Complications included 26 cerebral infarctions (3.8%), six of which (0.9%) resulted in serious paralysis and changes in consciousness. Among patients who received fenestrated stent grafts, paraplegia occurred in 2.6%, aortic injury in 1.2%, and iliofemoral artery injury in 6.0%. No complications resulted from occlusion of aortic arch branches. At >/=2 years after intervention, aneurysm diameter was reduced in 62% of patients, 33% had no change, and 5% had a diameter enlargement. The stent graft complication rate during follow-up was 8.4%, the device fracture rate was 1.4%, and the device migration rate was 7%. The 5-year survival rate was 62.4%, with follow-up in 96.8% of the patients.\nEndovascular repair has promising results in the descending thoracic aortic region, although some stent grafts and their delivery systems can still be improved. Additional commercial developments and available stent grafts designed for use in the distal arch are urgently needed.",

As vascular surgeons, our role must extend beyond that of the pure technician; we have been vested with the life-long care of these patients and, therefore, have a responsibility to the patient in addition the scientific community and society at large to create a strategy for management that serves all three interests justly.

    "abstract": "This review considers the roles of endovascular and open surgery for critical lower limb ischemia. The TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus document offers sensible guidelines for the treatment of both suprainguinal and infrainguinal disease. For bilateral/diffuse suprainguinal disease, aortobifemoral bypass remains the best option, but great care should be taken in this new era of hospital-acquired infection. Unilateral iliac occlusions should be treated by primary stenting, but an iliofemoral or femorofemoral bypass may be the best option when the disease extends down into the common femoral artery. Stents may reduce the risk of embolization in iliac stenoses but probably confer no benefit in long-term patency. Iliac stenoses should be treated by angioplasty, with stents reserved for flow-limiting complications. Although infrainguinal bypass surgery is in decline, probably due to better medical treatment and more endovascular intervention, bypass using autologous saphenous vein remains the gold standard. In the absence of leg veins, arm vein should be considered. Prosthetic grafts should be used as a last resort, and only with a venous cuff. The long-term results of the Bypass Versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischemia of the Leg (BASIL) trial favor surgery rather than angioplasty if there is a good vein and the patient is fit. Further randomized studies of infrainguinal stenting vs bypass are required. Some patients with critical lower limb ischemia are best treated by analgesia or primary amputation.",

    "abstract": "With the evolution of endovascular techniques, carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been compared to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Several studies have reported inferior results with CAS in the elderly. The objective of this study was to evaluate national outcomes of CAS and CEA and to compare utilization and outcomes of these procedures in different age groups.\nWe evaluated the 2005 Nationwide Inpatient Sample for hospitalizations with a procedure of CAS or CEA within 2 days after admission at age 60 years and above. Procedures were analyzed with respect to patient demographics and associated complications.\nA total of 80,498 carotid interventions (73,929 CEA and 6,569 CAS) were identified. The overall incidence of stroke was 4.16% after CAS and 2.66% after CEA (P < .0001). CAS was more often utilized in octogenarians than in younger patients (8.55% in 80+ vs 7.92% in 60-69 years; P < .0002). Increased age was not associated with greater stroke rates after CAS or CEA (P = .19 and .06, respectively). Octogenarians, compared to younger patients, had greater cardiac, pulmonary, and renal complications after CEA (3.0% vs 1.9%, 1.9% vs 1.0%, and 1.4% vs 0.54%, respectively; P < .0001). When adjusted by age, gender, complications, and Elixhauser comorbidities, patients after CAS were 1.6 times as likely to have a stroke (confidence interval [CI] = 1.37-1.78) when compared to CEA. Significant predictors of postoperative hospital mortality were stroke (odds ratio [OR] = 29.0; 95% CI = 21.5-39.1), cardiac complications (OR = 6.4; 95% CI = 4.4-9.1), pulmonary complications (OR = 3.5; 95% CI = 2.31-5.19), and renal failure (OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.6-3.8). With increasing age, overall mortality steadily increased after CAS (from 0.23% to 0.67%; P = .0409) but remained stable after CEA.\nOctogenarians did not have a higher risk of stroke after CAS when compared to younger patients. Stroke was the strongest predictor of hospital mortality. The increased utilization of CAS in the aged, which had significantly higher stroke rates in all age groups studied, may account for the greater hospital mortality seen after CAS in the elderly. Further studies focused on the aged are needed to define the best management strategies in the elderly.",

    "abstract": "This review describes and evaluates the results of laparoscopic aortic surgery.\nWe describe the different laparoscopic techniques used to treat aortic disease, including (1) total laparoscopic aortic surgery (TLS), (2) laparoscopy-assisted procedures including hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS), and (3) robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery, with their current indications. Results of these techniques are analyzed in a systematic review of the clinical series published between 1998 and 2008, each containing >10 patients with complete information concerning operative time, clamping time, conversion rate, length of hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality.\nWe selected and reviewed 29 studies that included 1073 patients. Heterogeneity of the studies and selection of the patients made comparison with current open or endovascular surgery difficult. Median operative time varied widely in TLS, from 240 to 391 minutes. HALS had the shortest operating time. Median clamping time varied from 60 to 146 minutes in TLS and was shorter in HALS. Median hospital stay varied from 4 to 10 days regardless of the laparoscopic technique. The postoperative mortality rate was 2.1% (95% confidence interval, 1.4-3.0), with no significant difference between patients treated for occlusive disease or for aneurysmal disease. Conversion to open surgery was necessary in 8.1% of patients and was slightly higher with TLS than with laparoscopy-assisted techniques (P = .07).\nAnalysis of these series shows that laparoscopic aortic surgery can be performed safely provided that patient selection is adjusted to the surgeon's experience and conversion is liberally performed. The future of this technique in comparison with endovascular surgery is still unknown, and it is now time for multicenter randomized trials to demonstrate the potential benefit of this type of surgery.",

Heterogeneity of the studies and selection of the patients made comparison with current open or endovascular surgery difficult. Median operative time varied widely in TLS, from 240 to 391 minutes. HALS had the shortest operating time. Median clamping time varied from 60 to 146 minutes in TLS and was shorter in HALS. Median hospital stay varied from 4 to 10 days regardless of the laparoscopic technique. The postoperative mortality rate was 2.1% (95% confidence interval, 1.4-3.0), with no significant difference between patients treated for occlusive disease or for aneurysmal disease. Conversion to open surgery was necessary in 8.1% of patients and was slightly higher with TLS than with laparoscopy-assisted techniques (P = .07).",

    "abstract": "Platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF), also known as thymidine phosphorylase (TP) reportedly inhibits vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) migration and proliferation. We hypothesized that adventitial administration of the PD-ECGF/TP gene will suppress intimal hyperplasia and prevent vein graft failure.\nThe study used 68 female rabbits. Rabbit jugular vein was autogenously transplanted into carotid artery with a cuff anastomotic technique. To define vascular wall gene transfer efficiency, poloxamer hydrogel (20%) containing plasmid vector encoding the LacZ gene and different concentrations of trypsin (0%, 0.1%, 0.25%, and 0.5%, n = 5 for each group) was applied to the adventitia of the vein graft. Gene transfer efficiency was evaluated 7 days later by X-gal staining. An additional 48 rabbits received poloxamer hydrogel (20%) containing 0.25% trypsin and the human PD-ECGF/TP gene, LacZ gene, or saline. Intima thickness was evaluated at 2 and 8 weeks after grafting (n = 8 for each group at each time point). Transgene expression was examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting assay, and immunohistochemical staining. Immunohistochemical staining was also used to determine VSMC proliferation, heme oxygenase-1 expression, and macrophage infiltration.\nIncorporation of trypsin into the poloxamer hydrogel significantly increased vessel wall gene transfer. Trypsin at 0.25% and 0.5% resulted in higher gene transfer at the same level without effecting intimal hyperplasia and inflammation; thus, trypsin at 0.25% concentration was used for subsequent experiments. Compared with the LacZ and saline groups, grafts receiving the PD-ECGF/TP gene significantly reduced intimal thickness at 2 and 8 weeks after treatment. The ratio of proliferative VSMC was lower in PD-ECGF/TP treated grafts. Histologic examination of the PD-ECGF/TP transgene grafts demonstrated high expression of heme oxygenase-1, which has been reported to inhibit VSMC proliferation, suggesting that heme oxygenase-1 may be important in the inhibition effect of PD-ECGF/TP on VSMC. No neoplastic or morphologic changes were found in the remote organs.\nA safe and highly efficient gene transfer method was developed by using poloxamer hydrogel and a low concentration of trypsin. Neointimal hyperplasia was significantly reduced by adventitial application of the PD-ECGF/TP gene to the vein graft. Our data suggest that adventitial delivery of the PD-ECGF/TP gene after grafting may be promising method for preventing vein graft failure.",

    "abstract": "Data regarding the long-term efficacy of carotid artery stenting (CAS) are still scarce. As demonstrated by several major randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) vs medical therapy, even after successful carotid revascularization late ipsilateral stroke occurs in 5-13% at 5 years. Therefore, major concerns also remain about the durability of the CAS procedure in terms of stroke prevention. The purpose of this study was to review long-term results after carotid stent implantation in a large cohort of patients.\nThis retrospective investigation involved 3179 CAS procedures performed at four European carotid high-volume centers. Echo-duplex scan using modified velocity criteria to recognize in-stent restenosis (ISR) and neurological examinations of all patients were carried out every 6 months after the procedure. Life-table analysis was used to determine freedom from mortality, stroke-related death, ipsilateral fatal/major stroke, and any ipsilateral stroke. Freedom from ISR and from reintervention were also reported. The secondary aim was to identify predictive risk factors for neurological complications and ISR.\nAt 5 years freedom from mortality, stroke-related death, ipsilateral fatal/major stroke, and any stroke rate were 82%, 93.5%, 93.3%, and 91.9%, respectively. The only predictor for neurological complications was the presence of neurological symptoms before CAS (hazard ratio 1.38 [CI 1.05, 1.82] P = .02). Freedom from restenosis at 1, 3, and 5 years was, respectively, 98.4%, 96.1%, and 94%. Uni- and multi-variate analyses showed that stent characteristics (material/design/free-cell area) were not significantly associated with time to in-stent restenosis or time to reintervention.\nOur long-term results in a large cohort of patients validated CAS as a durable procedure for stroke prevention. The annual rate of neurological complications after CAS was comparable to that of conventional surgery as demonstrated by large RCTs involving both symptomatic patients (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial [NASCET] and European Carotid Surgery Trial [ECST]) and asymptomatic patients (Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study [ACAS] and Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial [ACST]).",

    "abstract": "Early recurrent stenosis of the cephalic arch in autogenous arteriovenous access for hemodialysis is a common problem that requires stenting to prevent thrombosis. Because the results of stenting are unsatisfactory, we compared the efficacy of stent grafts with bare stents in these patients.\nAll patients who presented with recurrent cephalic arch stenosis >50% within 3 months of successful balloon angioplasty were randomized to have angioplasty and stenting with either a bare nitinol stent or a stent graft. Outcome was assessed by angiography 3 months later. Restenosis was defined as >50% narrowing of the stent lumen or of the vessel margin up to 0.5 cm adjacent to the stent. There were no exclusions.\nThis report includes data on the outcome of 25 consecutive patients with recurrent cephalic arch stenosis who were treated from April to August 2006. At 3 months, three patients had died and one had undergone a renal transplant. The 21 patients who had angiography at 3 months had patent stents. Restenosis rates were seven of 10 (70%) in the bare stent group and two of 11 (18%) in the stent graft group (P = .024). Life-table analysis at 3 and 6 months showed that primary patency was 82% in the stent graft group and 39% in the bare stent group. One-year primary patency was 32% in the stent graft group and 0% in the bare stent group (P = .0023). During a mean follow-up of 13.7 months, nine patients died, four in the bare stent group and five in the stent graft group. Two patients in the stent graft group had received a renal transplant. The number of interventions per patient-year was 1.9 in the bare stent group and 0.9 in the stent graft group (P = .02).\nThe use of stent grafts in angioplasty for recurrent cephalic arch stenosis significantly improved short-term restenosis rates and long-term patency compared with the use of bare stents. The significant improvement that emerged during the study caused accrual of patients to be halted for ethical reasons. This study altered our usage of stents for venous stenoses in arteriovenous accesses by eliminating bare nitinol stents in favor of stent grafts.",

    "abstract": "The management of infrarenal aortic aneurysms in high-risk patients remains a challenge. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is associated with superior short-term mortality rates but unclear long-term results and has not been shown to improve survival in patients unfit for open repair (OR). The aim of this population-based study was to evaluate the outcome after elective EVAR compared with OR in a high-risk patient cohort.\nProspectively collected data from January 2000 to December 2006 were retrieved from the Swedish Vascular Registry. The high-risk cohort was defined as age >or=60 years, American Anesthesiologists Association (ASA) class 3 or 4, and at least one cardiac, pulmonary, or renal comorbidity. These criteria were met by 217 of 1000 EVAR patients and 483 of 2831 OR patients. Primary end points were 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves for survival and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed.\nThe crude 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality rates for EVAR vs OR for the whole treatment group (n = 3831) were 1.8% vs 2.8% and 8.0% vs 7.2%, respectively. In the high-risk cohort (n = 700), EVAR patients were approximately 2 years older and renal insufficiency and diabetes mellitus were more common, and smoking was more prevalent in the OR group. About two-thirds of EVAR procedures were performed at university hospitals and one-half of OR procedures were performed at county hospitals. In the high-risk cohort, there was no difference in mortality at 30-days (EVAR, 4.6% vs OR, 3.3%), but OR had lower 1-year mortality (8.5% vs 15.9%; P = .003). More bleeding complications occurred in the EVAR group, but more pulmonary complications occurred in the OR group; however, there was no difference in cardiac, cerebrovascular, or renal complications. The mean follow-up was 3.4 years. EVAR was associated with increased mortality risk after adjusting for age, ASA class, and comorbidities (hazard ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.12; P = .02). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a lower mortality rate for patients undergoing OR, which remained during follow-up (P = .001).\nElective OR of aortic aneurysms seems to have a better outcome compared with EVAR in this specific, population-based, high-risk patient cohort after adjusting for covariates. We cannot confirm the benefit of EVAR from previous registry studies with a similar high-risk definition. In clinical practice, OR may be at least as good as EVAR in high-risk patients fit for surgery.",

    "abstract": "Significant renal artery stenosis (RAS) in a solitary functioning kidney (SFK) represents one of the most acceptable indications for renal revascularization. Percutaneous transluminal renal artery stenting (PTRAS) is increasingly being used as a first line treatment for renal revascularization, associated with renal function improvement or stabilization in the majority of the patients with solitary kidneys, but also with deterioration in up to 38% of the cases. Atheroembolism during PTRAS has been postulated as a potential cause for this acute renal function worsening. The aim of this study was to report on the feasibility, safety, and early outcomes of PTRAS in a series of patients with SFK using distal embolic protection (DEP).\nAll PTRAS procedures in SFKs performed under DEP between June 2002 and September 2007 were reviewed. Renal function, blood pressure, and the number of anti-hypertensive medications were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Renal function improvement and deterioration were defined as a 20% increase and decrease in serum creatinine, respectively, compared with preoperative values. Primary and primary assisted patency rates were also calculated. Statistical differences between values before and after intervention were determined by the Student t test and statistical significance was taken at P < .05.\nProtected PTRAS was performed in 14 patients with a SFK (9 men, 6 women, mean age 65.6 +/- 6.8 years). All patients were hypertensive and had varying degrees of azotemia. Mean pre-intervention stenosis degree was 86.8% +/- 7.8%. Immediate technical success was obtained in 100% of the patients. Renal function was cured (7.1%), improved (50%), or stabilized (42.9%) in all 14 (100%) patients after the procedure and no deterioration was noticed in any patient at 6-month follow-up. Pre- and postintervention serum creatinine levels were 3.01 +/- 1.15 mg/dL and 2.16 +/- 0.68 mg/dL, respectively, (P = .02). Hypertension was improved in 6 (42.9%) patients and stabilized in the remaining 8 (57.1%). Primary patency was 100% and 90% at 1 and 3 years, respectively, while primary assisted patency remained 100% for the whole follow-up period (mean, 31.8 +/- 19.4 months).\nThese findings suggest that in patients with a SFK, protected PTRAS represents a safe and effective treatment for halting the progression of renal dysfunction to renal loss and warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) remains the procedure of choice for treatment of patients with severe carotid artery stenosis. The role of carotid artery stenting (CAS) in this patient group is still being defined. Prior single and multicenter studies have demonstrated economic savings associated with CEA compared with CAS. The purpose of this study was to compare surgical outcomes and resource utilization associated with these two procedures at the national level in 2005, the first year in which a specific ICD-9 procedure code for CAS was available.\nAll patient discharges for carotid revascularization for the year 2005 were identified in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample based on ICD9-CM procedure codes for CEA (38.12) and CAS (00.63). The primary outcome measures of interest were in-hospital mortality and postoperative stroke; secondary outcome measures included total hospital charges and length of stay (LOS). All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 (Cary, NC), and data are weighted according to the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) design to draw national estimates. Univariate analyses of categorical variables were performed using Rao-Scott chi(2), and continuous variables were analyzed by survey weighted analysis of variance (ANOVA). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate independent predictors of postoperative stroke and mortality.\nDuring 2005, an estimated 135,701 patients underwent either CEA or CAS nationally. Overall, 91% of patients underwent CEA. The mean age overall was 71 years. Postoperative stroke rates were increased for CAS compared with CEA (1.8% vs 1.1%, P < .05), odds ratio (OR) 1.7; (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.3). Overall, mortality rates were higher for CAS compared with CEA (1.1% vs 0.57%, P < .05) this difference was substantially increased in regard to patients with symptomatic disease (4.6% vs 1.4%, P < .05). By logistic regression, CAS trended toward increased mortality, OR 1.5; (95% CI .96-2.5). Overall, the median total hospital charges for patients that underwent CAS were significantly greater than those that underwent CEA ($30,396 vs $17,658 P < .05).\nBased on a large representative sample during the year 2005, CEA was performed with significantly lower in-hospital mortality, postoperative stroke rates, and lower median total hospital charges than CAS in US hospitals. As the role for CAS becomes defined for the management of patients with carotid artery stenosis, clinical as well as economic outcomes must be continually evaluated.",

A retrospective analysis of these patients was performed. Thirty-one patients (65%) showed an acute aortic syndrome (8 contained rupture, 23 symptomatic). Follow-up scheme included postoperative computed tomography angiography prior to discharge, at 3, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter.

Perioperative mortality was significantly (P = .036) higher in patients with acute aortic syndrome compared to asymptomatic patients (22.5% vs 0%). Postoperative complications occurred in 15 patients (31%), including 2 patients with minor strokes and 6, respectively, 5 patients with cardiac and/or respiratory complications. Early endoleaks were observed in 9 patients (19%), late endoleaks in another 2 patients. Reintervention was necessary in 4 out of 48 patients (8.4%).

Midterm results could prove a sustained treatment success regarding actuarial survival and aortic-related death. Emergencies show a significantly worse outcome, but treatment is still warranted in these symptomatic patients.",

    "abstract": "Postplacement cost of surveillance and secondary procedures over 5 years increases the global cost of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) by nearly 50%. This study identified and assessed the reimbursement received for long-term postplacement costs after EVAR.\nBetween December 1995 and June 2007, 360 patients underwent EVAR at a single institution. The reimbursement collected from charges of postplacement surveillance and secondary procedures related to the aneurysmal disease was evaluated and compared against the actual costs. All amounts were converted to year 2007 dollars. To minimize costs associated with the early learning curve, the initial 50 EVAR patients between December 1995 and 1998 were excluded. Patients with <1 year follow-up were also excluded. Data are expressed as mean +/- standard error.\nThe mean follow up after EVAR for 152 patients was 38.8 +/- 1.8 months. Medicare, capitated insurance, and commercial insurance provided coverage for 85 (56.0%), 49 (32.2%), and 18 (11.8%) patients, respectively. The cumulative 5-year postplacement reimbursement received per patient was $9792 meeting 81.4% of the cumulative cost of $12,027 for a net loss of $2235 per patient. Although 123 (80.9%) patients without secondary procedures generated a 5-year cumulative gain of $1830 per patient, 29 (19.1%) patients with secondary procedures averaged a 5-year cumulative loss of $9378 per patient. The average reimbursement rate over the 5-year period was 35.8% +/- 0.6%, with the lowest reimbursement rate seen in patients with Medicare at 31.6% +/- 0.7%.\nCurrent reimbursement is not sufficient to meet the costs associated with long-term surveillance and needed secondary procedures after EVAR. Inadequate reimbursement of costs associated with secondary procedures was the primary driver for the net institutional loss.

Family history is an independent risk factor in coronary artery disease but the role of genetic factors is undefined in peripheral arterial disease. The fibrin clot is the final product of the atherothrombotic process and is subject to genetic influence. We proposed that healthy male FDR of subjects with IC possess abnormalities in their fibrin clots.\nThis was a case-control family study. The FDR were recruited from claudicants attending vascular surgery out-patient clinics with the control subjects being recruited from the local primary care register. A total of 106 white European male FDR of male subjects with IC were age matched with 107 white European male control subjects from an identical geographic area. The control subjects had no FDR with a history of symptomatic cardiovascular disease, and subjects from both groups were free from a personal history of symptomatic cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus. Ex vivo assays for fibrin clot permeation, fiber thickness, factor XIII cross-linking activity, and fibrinolysis were performed on the plasma of the above subjects. In addition, linear regression analysis was undertaken to determine factors associated with clot parameters.\nFor controls and FDR, respectively, fiber thickness by turbidity was 0.75 (0.67-0.93) vs 0.86 (0.75-0.98) (P < .001), and FXIII cross-linking activity was 105% (87-141) vs 133% (103-155) (P < .001). On confocal microscopy, fibers measured 315.8 (307.0-324.6) vs 405.1 (397.6-412.6) nm (P < .001), and lysis front velocity was 12.66 (6.38-18.94) vs 4.83 (2.50-7.17), mum/min (P = .018). Linear regression analysis revealed cholesterol was associated with changes in certain clot parameters.\nThe healthy FDR of subjects with IC produce clots which have thicker fibers, increased cross-linking, and resistance to fibrinolysis when compared to controls. This supports the potential genetic basis of peripheral arterial disease and highlights that cholesterol may contribute to this abnormal structure. This suggests that the FDR of subjects with IC, an apparently healthy sub-group of the population, have an elevated cardiovascular risk associated with abnormalities in their clot structure.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare resource utilization is an understudied aspect of vascular surgery. Initial cost of a given procedure is not an accurate reflection of resource utilization because it does not account for procedural durability and efficacy. Herein we describe an amortized cost model that accounts for procedural costs, durability, and re-intervention costs.\nA cost model was developed using patency data endpoints and total hospital costs (direct and indirect) associated with an inital revascularization and subsequent re-interventions. This model was applied to a retrospective database of femoropopliteal reconstructions. One hundred and eighty-three open cases were compared with 198 endovascular cases; and the endpoints of initial cost, amortized cost at 12 months, and assisted patency were examined.\nThe open and endovascular cases were not statistically different with respect to indication, patient co-morbid profiles, or post-procedural pharmacotherapy. Primary assisted patency was better in the open revascularization group at 12 months (78% versus 66%, P < .01). There was a statistically significant higher initial cost for open reconstruction when compared with endovascular ($12,389 +/- $408 versus $6,739 +/- $206, P < .001). However, at 12 months post-procedure, the initial cost benefit was lost for endovascular patients ($229 +/- $106 versus $185 +/- $124, P = .71). There was, however, a trend for endovascular cost savings in claudicants, though this did not reach significance ($259 +/- $189 versus $86 +/- $52, P = .31). For patients with critical limb ischemia, renal dysfunction, and end stage renal disease, the trend favored open surgery.\nAn amortized cost model provides insight into the healthcare resource utilization associated with a particular revascularization and assistive procedures. The initial cost savings of endovascular therapies are not sustained over time. Cost-savings trends were noted, however, longer follow-up is required to see if these will reach statistical significance.",

    "results": "The open and endovascular cases were not statistically different with respect to indication, patient co-morbid profiles, or post-procedural pharmacotherapy. Primary assisted patency was better in the open revascularization group at 12 months (78% versus 66%, P < .01). There was a statistically significant higher initial cost for open reconstruction when compared with endovascular ($12,389 +/- $408 versus $6,739 +/- $206, P < .001). However, at 12 months post-procedure, the initial cost benefit was lost for endovascular patients ($229 +/- $106 versus $185 +/- $124, P = .71). There was, however, a trend for endovascular cost savings in claudicants, though this did not reach significance ($259 +/- $189 versus $86 +/- $52, P = .31). For patients with critical limb ischemia, renal dysfunction, and end stage renal disease, the trend favored open surgery.",

    "abstract": "High performance athletes, predominantly professional cyclists, can develop symptomatic arterial flow restriction in one or both legs during exercise. The ischemic symptoms are caused by endofibrosis and/or kinking of the external iliac artery. Because these athletes are young and have no classic risk factors for atherosclerosis, endofibrosis and atherosclerosis are considered different disease entities. We compared histology of endofibrotic lesions from young sportsmen with atherosclerotic lesions of the external iliac artery in elderly individuals.\nNineteen external iliac endarterectomy specimens from 18 cyclists (age 29 +/- 8 years) were compared with 42 external iliac segments from 22 elderly individuals (82 +/- 10 years). Ten arteries from elderly individuals revealed an intimal area that was >or=25% of the area encompassed by the internal elastic lamina and were considered atherosclerotic lesions. Stenosis was higher in patients (65% [interquartile range 50-75]) than in controls (11% [7-24]) (P < .0001). The endofibrotic lesions revealed loose connective tissue with moderate to high cellularity. Both in endofibrosis and atherosclerosis, most cells in the lesion were smooth muscle actin positive. In the endofibrosis specimens, loose fibers of collagen were observed, whereas in the atherosclerotic lesions collagen was mostly densely packed. Calcification of the lesion was not observed in endofibrotic lesions, whereas calcium deposition was observed in 80% of atherosclerotic lesions. Lymphocytes were present in 21% of endofibrotic lesions and in 80% of atherosclerotic cases. Macrophages were observed in 16% of endofibrotic lesions and in all atherosclerotic plaques. Luminal thrombosis was observed in one case of endofibrosis.\nIn the external iliac artery, atherosclerotic lesions and endofibrotic lesions of high performance cyclists have distinct morphologic characteristics. Endofibrosis in the external iliac artery may serve as soil for luminal thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesize that endovenous laser ablation (EVA) therapy is equally successful in improving venous insufficiency symptoms in patients with or without deep venous insufficiency (DVI).\nFrom January 2005 through August 2007, EVA of the great saphenous vein (GSV) was attempted in 364 patients (460 limbs) with symptomatic GSV reflux. The GSV was successfully cannulated and obliterated in all but 17 limbs. EVA was performed alone in 308 limbs (69.5%) and with phlebectomy or perforator ligation (EVAP) in 135 limbs (30.5%). Venous clinical severity scores (VCSS) were recorded preoperatively and at 30, 90, 180, and 360 days postoperatively. Patients were classified as those with or without DVI based on duplex imaging valve closure times at the common femoral vein (CFV) and popliteal vein (PV). In a subset of 181 patients undergoing EVA therapy in the operating room, perioperative thrombosis prophylaxis was administered based on a risk-stratification protocol. Patients were assessed with direct end points (VCSS) and indirect end points (vein occlusion rates).\nSuccessful performance of EVA led to complete saphenous vein ablation in 99.8% at 1 month and 95.9% at 1 year. Median VCSS preoperatively was 6 (interquartile range, 5-8), generally decreasing over all time points to 4 (interquartile range, 2-5) beyond 360 days (P < .001). Male gender was independently associated with greater improvement in scores with time (P = .019). Changes in VCSS and duration of vessel occlusion were equivalent regardless of DVI for both isolated EVA and EVAP. For EVAP, the true deep venous thrombosis (DVT) rate was 2.2%, whereas for isolated EVA, the rate was 0% (P = .028); the rate of saphenofemoral thrombus extension was 5.9% for EVAP vs 7.8% for isolated EVA (P = .554). The use of risk-adjusted heparin prophylaxis in patients undergoing EVAP did not have a significant effect on thrombotic complications. There were no differences in true DVT, thrombus extension, or superficial thrombophlebitis between patients with or without DVI. Performance of concomitant phlebectomy, DVI, gender, and age had no effect on the duration of vessel occlusion.\nEVA produces successful ablation and is associated with sustained improvement in VCSS. These outcomes are independent of the presence of DVI. Finally, the use of a risk-adjusted thrombosis prevention protocol had no effect on the rate of superficial thrombus extension from EVA or EVAP in patients undergoing general anesthesia.",

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing amputation of the lower limb due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are at risk of developing deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Few studies in the research literature report the incidence of DVT during the early postoperative period or the risk factors for the development of DVT in the amputation stump. This prospective study evaluated the incidence of DVT during the first 35 postoperative days in patients who had undergone amputation of the lower extremity due to PAD and its relation to comorbidities and death.\nBetween September 2004 and March 2006, 56 patients (29 men), with a mean age of 67.25 years, underwent 62 amputations, comprising 36 below knee amputations (BKA) and 26 above knee amputations (AKA). Echo-Doppler scanning was performed preoperatively and on postoperative days 7 and 31 (approximately). All patients received acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg daily) preoperatively and postoperatively, but none received prophylactic anticoagulation.\nDVT occurred in 25.8% of extremities with amputations (10 AKA and 6 BKA). The cumulative incidence in the 35-day postoperative period was 28% (Kaplan-Meier). There was a significant difference (P = .04) in the incidence of DVT between AKA (37.5%) and BKA (21.2%). Age >or=70 years (48.9% vs 16.8%, P = .021) was also a risk factor for DVT in the univariate analysis. Of the 16 cases, 14 (87.5%) were diagnosed during outpatient care. The time to discharge after amputation was averaged 6.11 days in-hospital stay (range, 1-56 days). One symptomatic nonfatal pulmonary embolism occurred in a patient already diagnosed with DVT. There was no relation between other comorbidities and DVT. The multivariate analysis showed no association between risk factors and the occurrence of DVT in the amputated extremity. DVT ipsilateral to the amputation did not influence the mortality rate (9.7%).\nThe incidence of DVT in the early postoperative period (<or=35 days) was elevated principally in patients aged >or=70 years and for AKA. Patients with PAD who have recently undergone major amputations should be considered at high risk for DVT, even after hospital discharge. Given the high rate of postoperative DVT observed in this study, we now recommend prophylactic anticoagulation for these patients, but further study is needed to determine the optimal duration and efficacy of this treatment.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) augments skin blood flow through transient suspension of local vasoregulation, the veno-arteriolar response (VAR), in healthy controls and in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nNineteen healthy limbs and twenty-two limbs with PAD were examined. To assess VAR, skin blood flow (SBF) was measured using laser Doppler fluxmetry in the horizontal and sitting positions and was defined as percentage change with postural alteration [(horizontal SBF--sitting SBF)/horizontal SBF x 100]. On IPC application to the foot, the calf, or both, SBF was measured with laser Doppler fluxmetry, the probe being attached to the pulp of the big toe.\nBaseline VAR was higher in the controls 63.8 +/- 6.4% than in patients with PAD (31.7 +/- 13.4%, P = .0162). In both groups SBF was significantly higher with IPC than at rest (P < .0001). A higher percentage increase with IPC was demonstrated in the controls (242 +/- 85% to 788 +/- 318%) than in subjects with PAD, for each one of the three different IPC modes investigated (98 +/- 33% to 275 +/- 72%) with IPC was demonstrated. The SBF enhancement with IPC correlated with VAR for all three compression modes (r = 0.58, P = .002 for calf compression, r = 0.65, P < .0001 for foot compression alone, and r = 0.64, P = .0002 for combined foot and calf compression).\nThe integrity of the veno-arteriolar response correlates with the level of skin blood flow augmentation generated with intermittent pneumatic compression, indicating that this may be associated with a transient suspension of the autoregulatory vasoconstriction both in healthy controls and in patients with PAD.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus results in a procoagulant and thrombogenic state that could predispose diabetic individuals to develop venous thrombosis. We sought to determine whether diet-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus affects deep venous thrombosis (DVT) resolution in a murine model.\nC57Bl/6 mice were fed a low-fat or a high-fat diet (n = 10) for 10 weeks, after which DVT was created in the inferior vena cava (IVC) by a combination of low flow and endothelial damage. The IVC and thrombus were harvested at 1 and 2 weeks. Thrombus resolution and neovascularization were investigated through transfemoral angiography (n = 10), thrombus size (n = 4) and weight (n = 10), and nitric oxide synthase 3 immunoquantification (n = 4). Macrophage content was assessed by CD68 immunoreactivity (n = 4). The fibrinolytic system (urokinase plasminogen activator [uPA] and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1]) was analyzed by Western immunoblotting (n = 6) and immunohistochemistry (n = 4). Total collagen was stained by Sirius red. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activities were evaluated by zymography and their expressions by Western immunoblotting (n = 6) and immunohistochemistry (n = 4).\nDiabetic mice had significantly larger and heavier thrombi at 1 and 2 weeks (P < .05), threefold less neovascularization (P < .05), and 35-fold increase in macrophage content (P < .01), than control mice 2 weeks after surgery.

Increased vein wall collagen and less uPA and more PAI-1 expressions with a decreased uPA/PAI-1 ratio (31%, P < .01) were documented at 2 weeks in diabetic mice.

    "abstract": "Conflicting data exist regarding the effect of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) on carotid endarterectomy (CEA) outcomes. A large database was used to analyze the effect of CRI, defined by glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as an independent risk factor of CEA.\nProspectively collected data regarding CEAs performed at 123 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers as part of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program were retrospectively analyzed. Renal function was used to divide patients into three CRI groups: normal or mild (control; GFR >/=60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), moderate (GFR 30 to 59), and severe (GFR <30). Bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to characterize risk factors and their associations with 30-day morbidity and mortality.\nBetween Jan 1, 1996, and Dec 31, 2003, 22,080 patients underwent CEA. Patients missing creatinine levels, already dialysis-dependent, or in acute renal failure just before surgery were excluded. This left 20,899 available for analysis, of which 13,965 had a GFR of >/=60, 6,423 had a GFR of 30 to 59, and 511 had a GFR of <30. The incidence of neurologic complications did not differ significantly (control, 1.7%; moderate CRI, 1.9%; severe CRI, 2.7%). The moderate CRI group experienced significantly more cardiac events (1.7% vs 0.9% for controls, P < .001). This remained predictive in the multivariate model even adjusting for all other risk factors (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.3; P = .009). The moderate CRI group also had higher rates of pulmonary complications (2.1% vs 1.3% control; P < .001; AOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7; P = .031) but not 30-day mortality (P = .269). Those with severe CRI had a much higher mortality (3.1% vs 1.0% control, P < .001), which remained significant in the multivariate model (AOR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.8; P < .001).\nAlthough impaired renal function does not independently increase the risk of neurologic or infectious complications, CRI is a significant negative independent risk factor in predicting other outcomes after CEA. Patients with moderate CRI (GFR, 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) are at increased risk for cardiac and pulmonary morbidity, but not death, and those with severe CRI (GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) have a much higher operative mortality. Patients with CRI should be carefully evaluated before CEA to optimize existing cardiac and pulmonary disease. Understanding this increased risk may assist the surgeon in preoperative counseling and perioperative management.",

This retrospective study compared the outcomes and durability of recanalization, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, and stenting (R/PTAS) vs ABF for severe AIOD.\nBetween 1998 and 2004, 86 patients (161 limbs) underwent ABF (n = 75) or iliofemoral bypass (n = 11), and 83 patients (127 limbs) underwent R/PTAS. All patients had severe symptomatic AIOD (claudication, 53%; rest pain, 28%; tissue loss, 12%; acute limb ischemia, 7%). The analyses excluded patients treated for aneurysms, extra-anatomic procedures, and endovascular treatment of iliac stenoses. Original angiographic imaging, medical records, and noninvasive testing were reviewed. Kaplan-Meier estimates for patency and survival were calculated and univariate analyses performed. Mortality was verified by the Social Security database.\nThe ABF patients were younger than the R/PTAS patients (60 vs 65 years; P = .003) and had higher rates of hyperlipidemia (P = .009) and smoking (P < .001). All other clinical variables, including cardiac status, diabetes, symptoms at presentation, TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus stratification, and presence of poor outflow were similar between the two groups. Patients underwent ABF with general anesthesia (96%), often with concomitant treatment of femoral or infrainguinal disease (61% endarterectomy, profundaplasty, or distal bypass). Technical success was universal, with marked improvement in ankle-brachial indices (0.48 to 0.84, P < .001). Patients underwent R/PTAS with local anesthesia/sedation (78%), with a 96% technical success rate and similar hemodynamic improvement (0.36 to 0.82, P < .001). At the time of R/PTAS, 21% of patients underwent femoral endarterectomy/profundaplasty or bypass (n = 5) for concomitant infrainguinal disease. Limb-based primary patency at 3 years was significantly higher for ABF than for R/PTAS (93% vs 74%, P = .002). Secondary patency rates (97% vs 95%), limb salvage (98% vs. 98%), and long-term survival (80% vs 80%) were similar. Diabetes mellitus and the requirement of distal bypass were associated with decreased patency (P < .001). Critical limb ischemia at presentation (tissue loss, hazard ratio [HR], 8.1; P < .001), poor outflow (HR, 2; P = .023), and renal failure (HR, 2.5; P = .02) were associated with decreased survival.\nR/PTAS is a suitable, less invasive alternative to ABF for the treatment of severe AIOD. Repair of the concomitant femoral occlusive disease is often needed regardless of open or endovascular treatment. Infrainguinal disease negatively affects the durability of the procedure and patient survival.",

    "abstract": "Early thrombus removal in patients with iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (IFDVT) reduces postthrombotic morbidity. Preserving valve function and relieving venous obstruction prevents deterioration of quality of life and loss of economic potential. The preferred method for treating IFDVT is catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT). Recently, isolated segmental pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (ISPMT) has emerged as a treatment option for patients with extensive IFDVT. The purpose of our study is to determine whether there are advantages to using ISPMT as the primary treatment for patients with iliofemoral IFDVT and, if so, to quantify those advantages relative to CDT.\nForty-three patients with IFDVT were treated with percutaneous CDT between May 2003 and June 2007. Twenty-one patients (27 limbs) were treated with CDT and 22 patients (25 limbs) were treated with ISPMT +/- CDT. Demographics, extent of thrombus, procedural details, and thrombus resolution were recorded.\nTreatment time (55.4 vs 23.4 hours; P < .0001) and dose of rt-PA (59.3 vs 33.4 mg; P = .0009) were decreased and overall lytic success (60% vs 80%; P = .0016) increased with ISPMT. Adjunctive venoplasty and stenting, complications, hospital length-of-stay (LOS), and intensive care unit LOS were similar between groups.\nISPMT offers more effective thrombus removal in less time and with a reduced dose of thrombolytic agent. However, decreased treatment time did not translate into decreased hospital or ICU stay. Longer-term follow-up is required to determine whether improved thrombus resolution translates to better functional outcome and reduced postthrombotic morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Renal artery aneurysms are being discovered more frequently due to increased use of non-invasive imaging. Complex renal artery aneurysms involving multiple secondary or tertiary branches are not amenable to in vivo or endovascular treatment and often require ex vivo repair with autotransplantation. In order to minimize incisional morbidity and hasten recovery, we developed a technique of laparoscopic nephrectomy combined with backbench ex vivo repair, followed by autotransplantation through a small laparoscopic extraction incision. This study describes our initial experience with this combined technique in patients that were not candidates for endovascular techniques or in vivo arterial reconstruction.\nSeven patients with complex renal artery aneurysms underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy and ex vivo repair with multiple saphenous vein grafts and autotransplantation through the small laparoscopic extraction incision. The aneurysms ranged from 2.5 to 5.0 cm. In all cases, the aneurysm was resected ex vivo, leaving multiple branch arteries that were extended with saphenous vein grafts. Arterial inflow was then re-established with sequential saphenous vein anastomoses to the external iliac artery. Ureteral reconstruction was performed via standard Lich ureteroneocystostomy. Patients were followed postoperatively for two to eight years.\nLaparoscopic nephrectomy with ex vivo repair of complex aneurysms was successfully employed in seven patients with renal aneurysms that were not amenable to endovascular or in vivo repair. There were no incisional morbidities and all patients had significant improvements in symptoms post-operatively. Renal function remained unchanged and there were no ureteral complications following surgery. All patients had postoperative ultrasound imaging done at two years which demonstrated patency of the anastomoses. The mean hospital stay was four days (range, two to seven days).\nRepair of complex renal artery aneurysms involving distal branch arteries remains a challenge. This new technique combines the advantages of minimally invasive surgery with the effectiveness of ex vivo aneurysm repair.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair of injured thoracic aorta offers a new minimal invasive therapeutic option that could be beneficial in the urgent management of polytrauma patients. The aim of this study was to assess our multicenter experience of immediate endovascular repair for acute traumatic injuries of the thoracic aorta.\nBetween April 2002 and October 2007, all patients treated for an acute traumatic injury of the thoracic aorta, in a less than 12-hour delay, by endovascular repair, were reviewed retrospectively in three Parisian trauma centers. Collected data included age, sex, associated comorbidities, and traumatic lesions to determine the Traumatic Injury Severity Score (TRISS), the type of aortic lesion assessed by computed tomography (CT)-scan and transesophageal ultrasonography, technical aspects of endovascular repair, length of hospital stay, and postoperative mortality. Patients were regularly followed by clinical examination, chest radiographs, and thoracic CT-scan.\nTwenty-eight patients (20 males, mean age 45 +/- 18.8 years) were treated in a median delay of 5 hours (range 2 to 10 hours) after initial trauma. They all experienced severe traumatic injuries with a mean predictive mortality of 55.6% +/- 33.1% according to TRISS. Aortic lesions were associated with aortic parietal hematoma (71%), hemomediastinum (86%), and hemothorax (68%). All endovascular procedures were technically successful through femoral (n = 24) or iliac access (n = 4), in a mean operating time of 94 +/- 35.8 minutes. Proximal sealing of the endografts required the coverage of the origin of the left subclavian artery in 13 cases and of the left common carotid in one case. The median of hospital stay was 27 days (range 9 to 127 days), with an overall hospital mortality of 17.9% (n = 5). All deaths were unrelated to the aortic rupture or the stent placement, and no intervention-related morbidity or mortality was recorded during a median follow-up of 24 months (range 5 to 73 months).\nEndovascular stent grafting allows an immediate efficient repair for acute traumatic injuries of the thoracic aorta. This early management is, however, associated with a high in-hospital mortality, related to the severe concomitant injuries of such unselected multitrauma patients.",

    "abstract": "This experimental study investigated the hemodynamic effect of corrective procedures for arteriovenous access-related ischemia in pulsatile flow.\nSilicone models of an emulated tapered and bifurcated arterial tree of the upper arm and forearm were integrated into a pulsatile flow circuit. The model allowed the study of hemodynamics of simulated arteriovenous fistulas, including collateral circulation, as well as the study of different simulated procedures to improve distal hypoperfusion. Flow rates and arterial pressure were measured simultaneously during simulation of corrective procedures and correlated to hemodynamic values of uncorrected ischemia.\nIt was demonstrated that the more proximally localized an arteriovenous anastomosis is, the higher the distal arterial pressure will be at any given fistula flow. Reduction of the fistula flow resulted in a significant improvement of distal perfusion. Ligation of the artery distal to the arteriovenous fistula to prevent retrograde flow increased the distal perfusion only slightly in simulated ischemia. In contrast, the simulated corrective procedures of distal revascularization interval ligation and proximalization of arterial inflow resulted in a significant improvement. The most significant improvement of distal perfusion was observed with the simulated proximalization technique, whereas the effect of distal revascularization technique was less pronounced at higher fistula flow. Arterial ligation after distal revascularization increased the distal pressure only by 10%.\nA more centrally localized arteriovenous anastomosis and a reduction of fistula flow significantly increase distal perfusion. The procedure of proximalization of arterial inflow is at least equivalent to the distal revascularization interval ligation technique for the correction of distal ischemia, but does not sacrifice a patent axial artery. The moderate effect of interval ligation of the latter technique should be evaluated by further intraoperative measurements.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are at risk of rupture when the internal load (blood pressure) exceeds the aneurysm wall strength. Generally, the maximal diameter of the aneurysm is used as a predictor of rupture; however, biomechanical properties may be a better predictor than the maximal diameter. Compliance and distensibility are two biomechanical properties that can be determined from the pressure-volume relationship of the aneurysm. This study determined the compliance and distensibility of the AAA by simultaneous instantaneous pressure and volume measurements; as a secondary goal, the influence of direct and indirect pressure measurements was compared.\nTen men (aged 73.6 +/- 6.4 years) with an infrarenal AAA were studied. Three-dimensional balanced turbo field echo (3D B-TFE) images were acquired with noncontrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the aortic region proximal to the renal arteries until just beyond the bifurcation. Volume changes were extracted from the electrocardiogram-triggered 3D B-TFE MRI images using dedicated prototype software. Pressure was measured simultaneously within the AAA using a fluid-filled pigtail catheter. Noninvasive brachial cuff measurements were also acquired before and after the imaging sequence simultaneously with the invasive pressure measurement to investigate agreement between the techniques. Compliance was calculated as the slope of the best linear fit through the pressure volume data points. Distensibility was calculated by dividing the compliance by the diastolic aneurysmal volume. Young's moduli were estimated from the compliance data.\nThe AAA maximal diameter was 5.8 +/- 0.6 cm. A strong linear relation between the pressure and volume data was found. Distensibility was 1.8 +/- 0.7 x 10(-3) kPa(-1). Average compliance was 0.31 +/- 0.15 mL/kPa with accompanying estimates for Young's moduli of 9.0 +/- 2.5 MPa. Brachial cuff measurements demonstrated an underestimation of 5% for systolic (P < .001) and an overestimation of 12% for diastolic blood pressure (P < .001) compared with the pressure measured within the aneurysm.\nDistensibility and compliance of the wall of the aneurysm were determined in humans by simultaneous intra-aneurysmal pressure and volume measurements. A strong linear relationship existed between the intra-aneurysmal pressure and the volume change of the AAA. Brachial cuff measurements were significantly different compared with invasive intra-aneurysmal measurements. Consequently, no absolute distensibility values can be determined noninvasively. However, because of a constant and predictable difference between directly and indirectly derived blood pressures, MRI-based monitoring of aneurysmal distensibility may serve the online rupture risk during follow-up of aneurysms.",

Our purpose in this study is to determine if access complications could be reduced by the use of a standardized protocol.\nWe studied prospectively 210 consecutive patients in our vascular surgery practice undergoing peripheral arterial interventions via percutaneous retrograde femoral access. First, we prospectively collected data to determine current outcomes during a 4-month observation phase. Based on these experiences, we designed and implemented a uniform arterial closure protocol, with closure device use guided by sheath size, arterial calcification, and previous groin scarring. Our main outcome measures were major complications (need for operation) or minor complications (access site bleeding or hematoma). Outcomes were compared between the two phases using chi-squared analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA).\nIn the observation phase, 119 patients underwent 140 arterial punctures, and in the postprotocol phase, we performed 112 punctures in 91 patients. Between the observation and postprotocol phases, patient demographics were similar; average sheath size was unchanged (sheaths over 6F 6% vs 8%, respectively, P = .55), and percentage of patients receiving heparin did not change significantly (76% vs, 86%, P = .08). No major complications occurred in either the observation or the postprotocol phases. While 24 minor complications occurred in the observation phase, only seven minor complications occurred in the postprotocol phase (17% vs 7%, P < .02). Closure device use decreased with protocol implementation (57% to 32%, P < .01), but closure device failures also decreased from 23% to 7% (P < .01).\nProcess improvement, achieved by instituting a standardized percutaneous arterial closure protocol based on selective closure device use guided by sheath size, arterial calcification, and previous access scarring. Implementation of our protocol resulted in a decrease in the incidence of minor complications at the access site and refined patient selection for closure device use.",

Excluded were, for example, patients with lesions unsuitable for revascularization (iliac or femoropopliteal TASC-type D and some TASC type-B/C.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to endovascular revascularization (76 patients) or supervised hospital-based exercise (75 patients).\nMean improvement of health-related quality-of-life and functional capacity over a 12-month period, cumulative 12-month costs, and incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were assessed from the societal perspective.\nIn the endovascular revascularization group, 73% (55 patients) had iliac disease vs 27% (20 patients) femoral disease. Stents were used in 46/71 iliac lesions (34 patients) and in 20/40 femoral lesions (16 patients). In the supervised hospital-based exercise group, 68% (51 patients) had iliac disease vs 32% (24 patients) with femoral disease. There was a non-significant difference in the adjusted 6- and 12-month EuroQol, rating scale, and SF36-physical functioning values between the treatment groups. The gain in total mean QALYs accumulated during 12 months, adjusted for baseline values, was not statistically different between the groups (mean difference revascularization versus exercise 0.01; 99% CI -0.05, 0.07; P = .73). The total mean cumulative costs per patient was significantly higher in the revascularization group (mean difference euro2318; 99% CI 2130 euros, 2506 euros; P < .001) and the incremental cost per QALY was 231 800 euro/QALY adjusted for the baseline variables. One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated improved effectiveness after revascularization (mean difference 0.03; CI 0.02, 0.05; P < .001), making the incremental costs 75 208 euro/QALY.\nIn conclusion, there was no significant difference in effectiveness between endovascular revascularization compared to supervised hospital-based exercise during 12-months follow-up, any gains with endovascular revascularization found were non-significant, and endovascular revascularization costs more than the generally accepted threshold willingness-to-pay value, which favors exercise.",
