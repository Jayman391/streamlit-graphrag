    "abstract": "An elevated plasma homocysteine level is an established risk factor for atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and lower extremity occlusive disease (LED). An elevated plasma homocysteine level can be reduced by therapy with folate and vitamins B6 and B12. An accurate evaluation of the role of vitamin therapy requires knowledge of the influence of plasma homocysteine levels on the progression of CHD, CVD, and LED.\nThe Homocysteine and Progression of Atherosclerosis Study is a blinded prospective study of the influence of homocysteine and of other atherosclerotic risk factors on the progression of disease in patients with symptomatic CVD, LED, or both. This study is set in a university hospital vascular surgery clinic and the General Clinical Research Center. Consecutive patients with stable symptomatic CVD or LED underwent baseline clinical, laboratory, and vascular laboratory testing for homocysteine and other risk factors and were examined every 6 months. The primary endpoints were ankle brachial pressure index, duplex scan-determined carotid stenosis, and death. The secondary endpoints were the clinical progressions of CHD, LED, and CVD. The hypothesis that was tested was whether the progression of symptomatic CVD or LED was more frequent or more rapid in patients with elevated plasma homocysteine levels. plasma homocysteine levels.\nAfter a mean follow-up period of 37 months (range, 1 to 78 months) for deaths from all causes (>14 micromol/L; elevated, 18.6%; normal, 9.4%; P = .022), deaths from cardiovascular disease (elevated, 12.5%; normal, 6.3%; P = .05) and the clinical progression of CHD (highest 20% of homocysteine levels, 80%; lowest 20% of homocysteine levels, 39%; P = .007) were significantly more frequent or more rapid by life-table analysis when the homocysteine levels were elevated. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model showed a significant independent and increasing relationship between the plasma homocysteine levels and the time to death (relative risk for highest one third of homocysteine values, 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 2.56; P = 029; and relative risk for highest one fifth of homocysteine values, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.69 to 6.64; P = .0001). After an adjustment for age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol, and the vascular laboratory progression of CVD or LED, each 1.0 micromol/L increase in the plasma homocysteine levels resulted in a 3.6% increase (95% CI, 0.0% to 6.6%; P = .06) in the risk of death (all causes) at 3 years and a 5.6% increase (95% CI, 2.2% to 8.5%; P = .003) in the risk of death from cardiovascular disease.\nWe conclude that elevated plasma homocysteine levels are associated significantly with death, with death from cardiovascular disease, and with the progression of CHD in patients with symptomatic CVD or LED. These results strongly mandate clinical trials of homocysteine-lowering vitamin therapy in such patients.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic grafts have been increasingly used for complex vascular reconstructions in patients with limited autologous vein availability. Materials currently in use induce increased stenosis and graft thrombosis compared with autologous vein, especially in smaller vessels. We examined whether grafts constructed of a porous biodegradation-resistant polycarbonate polyurethane (PU) exert better biocompatibility in terms of faster endothelialization and decreased chronic proliferation of intimal cells compared with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE).\nPU or ePTFE interposition grafts were implanted into the abdominal aortas of male Sprague-Dawley rats (PU, n = 37; ePTFE, n = 32). Grafts were removed at days 1, 7, 14, 28, and 56 and 6 months and were evaluated by immunohistochemical, electron microscopic, and morphometric techniques. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected at 1 and 24 hours before death to determine cellular proliferation. Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were identified with antibodies to von Willebrand factor and alpha-actin, respectively.\nThe luminal surface of PU grafts took 4 weeks to completely endothelialize, whereas ePTFE grafts took 24 weeks (P <.05). Neointimal cell proliferation was lower in PU grafts compared with ePTFE at 56 days (1.4 +/- 0.1 versus 8.6 +/- 1.5, P <.001) and at 6 months (0.15 +/- 0.002 versus 3.4 +/- 0.5, p <.001). Neointimal thickness at 6 months after implantation was 3.2 +/- 0.8 micrometer for PU compared with 10.3 +/- 3.1 micrometer for ePTFE (P <.05).\nPolycarbonate polyurethane small vascular prostheses promoted faster luminal endothelialization, induced less chronic intimal proliferation, and produced a significantly thinner neointima than ePTFE grafts. These findings suggest that aliphatic-polycarbonate urethanes may offer advantages over standard materials such as ePTFE for vascular graft construction.",

    "abstract": "The absence of endothelial cells at the luminal surface of a prosthetic vascular graft potentiates thrombosis and neointimal hyperplasia, which are common causes of graft failure in humans. This study tested the hypothesis that pretreatment with chronic in vitro shear stress enhances subsequent endothelial cell retention on vascular grafts implanted in vivo.\nCultured endothelial cells derived from Fischer 344 rat aorta were seeded onto the luminal surface of 1.5-mm internal diameter polyurethane vascular grafts. The seeded grafts were treated for 3 days with 1 dyne/cm2 shear stress and then for an additional 3 days with 1 or 25 dyne/cm2 shear stress in vitro. The grafts then were implanted as aortic interposition grafts into syngeneic rats in vivo. Grafts that were similarly seeded with endothelial cells but not treated with shear stress and grafts that were not seeded with endothelial cells served as controls. The surgical hemostasis time was monitored. Endothelial cell identity, density, and graft patency rate were evaluated 24 hours after implantation. Endothelial cell identity in vivo was confirmed with cells transduced in vitro with beta-galactosidase complementary DNA in a replication-deficient adenoviral vector. Histologic, scanning electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed 1 week and 3 months after implantation to establish cell identity and to measure neointimal thickness.\nThe pretreatment with 25 dyne/cm2 but not with 0 or 1 dyne/cm2 shear stress resulted in the retention of fully confluent endothelial cell monolayers on the grafts 24 hours after implantation in vivo. Retention of seeded endothelial cells was confirmed by the observation that beta-galactosidase transduced cells were retained as a monolayer 24 hours after implantation in vivo. In the grafts with adherent endothelial cells that were pretreated with shear stress, immediate graft thrombosis was inhibited and surgical hemostasis time was significantly prolonged. Confluent intimal endothelial cell monolayers also were present 1 week and 3 months after implantation. However, 1 week after implantation, macrophage infiltration was observed beneath the luminal cell monolayer. Three months after the implantation in vivo, subendothelial neointimal cells that contained alpha-smooth muscle actin were present. The thickness of this neointima averaged 41 +/- 12 micrometer and 60 +/- 23 micrometer in endothelial cell-seeded grafts that were pretreated with 25 dyne/cm2 shear stress and 1 dyne/cm2 shear stress, respectively, and 158 +/- 46 micrometer in grafts that were not seeded with endothelial cells.\nThe effect of chronic shear stress on the enhancement of endothelial cell retention in vitro can be exploited to fully endothelialize synthetic vascular grafts, which reduces immediate in vivo graft thrombosis and subsequent neointimal thickness.",

    "abstract": "The relationship of the division of the diaphragm during thoracoabdominal aortic repair to prolonged ventilator support has not been studied. The purpose of this study was (1) to determine whether preservation of diaphragm integrity has a significant effect on postoperative ventilator duration and (2) to elucidate other pulmonary risk factors related to thoracoabdominal aortic surgery and to study the relationship of these factors to the intact diaphragm technique.\nBetween February 1991 and January 1997, we repaired 397 descending and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Descending thoracic aneurysms were not included in the study because their repair does not include the diaphragm. A total of 256 patients participated in this study. The diaphragm was divided in 150 patients and left intact in 106 patients. Examined as potential risk factors were patient demographics, history and physical findings, aneurysm extent, urgency of the procedure, acute dissection, cross-clamp time, homologous and autologous blood product consumption, and adjunctive operative techniques. FEV1 also was considered in the 197 patients for whom preoperative spirometry was available. Prolonged mechanical ventilation was defined as ventilator support for >72 hours. Data were analyzed by univariate contingency table and multiple logistic regression methods.\nIncreasing age (odds ratio [OR], 1.02/y; P <.02), current smoking (OR, 2.6; P <.0008), total cross-clamp time (OR, 1.0/min; P <.008), units packed red blood cells transfused (OR, 1.06/unit; P <.008), and division of the diaphragm (OR, 2.03; P <.02) were significant, independent predictors of prolonged ventilation. Sixty-seven percent of patients (71 of 106) whose diaphragms were preserved were extubated in <72 hours compared with 52% of patients (78 of 150) who underwent diaphragm division (OR, 0.53; P <.02).\nIndependently of well known pulmonary risk factors, an intact diaphragm during thoracoabdominal aortic repair results in a higher probability of early ventilator weaning.",

    "abstract": "The surgical management of chronic atherosclerotic renal artery occlusion (RA-OCC) was studied.\nFrom January 1987 through December 1996, 397 consecutive patients were treated for atherosclerotic renal artery disease. Ninety-five hypertensive patients (mean blood pressure, 204 +/- 31/106 +/- 20 mm Hg; mean medications, 3.0 +/- 1.1 drugs) were treated for 100 RA-OCCs. Eighty-four (88%) patients had renal dysfunction, defined by serum creatinine levels >/=1.3 mg/dL (mean serum creatinine level, 2.8 +/- 2.0 mg/dL). Demographic characteristics, operative morbidity and mortality, blood pressure/renal function response, and postoperative decline in renal function were examined and compared with that of 302 patients treated for renal artery stenosis (RAS).\nAfter operation, there were 5 perioperative deaths (5.2%), 2 (2.8%) after revascularization and 3 (12%) after nephrectomy (P =.11), compared with 12 (4.0%) perioperative deaths in the RAS group (P =.59). After controlling for important covariates, estimated survival and blood pressure benefits did not differ between RA-OCC patients treated by nephrectomy or revascularization (P =.13; 87% vs 92%, P =.54).

In addition, blood pressure benefit, renal function response, and estimated survival did not differ significantly after reconstruction for RA-OCC or RAS.\nAmong hypertensive patients treated for RA-OCC, equivalent beneficial blood pressure response was observed after both revascularization and nephrectomy. In patients who underwent bilateral renal artery revascularization, the change in excretory renal function attributable to repair of RA-OCC cannot be defined. In patients treated for unilateral disease, however, improvement in function was observed only after revascularization.

    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proteolytic enzymes that can degrade the extracellular matrix of the aortic wall and lead to the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). MMP inhibitors are a class of drugs that were developed to inhibit the activity of these proteolytic enzymes and are currently being studied as a way to control inflammatory diseases and cancer metastases. In this project, BB-94 (also known as batimastat), a specific inhibitor of MMPs, was evaluated for its ability to control aneurysmal growth in an experimental AAA model.\nExperimental AAAs were created in a standard rat model by perfusing elastase into an isolated segment of aorta. The rats then were randomized to postoperatively undergo treatment daily with the MMP inhibitor BB-94 or the carrier control solution. Measurements of the aortic diameter were made at the time of initial surgery and at the time of death on postoperative day 7. Aortic tissue was obtained for histologic examination, elastin evaluation, and MAC 1-alpha antibody staining to evaluate the inflammatory response.\nThe rats that underwent treatment with BB-94 had significantly less aneurysmal dilatation and a 113% increase in aortic size, as compared with the control rats that had a 157% increase (P =.026). Histologic examination of the harvested aortas and grading of the elastin content showed a significantly greater elastin preservation in those rats that were treated with BB-94 as compared with the control rats (P =.036). MAC 1-alpha antibody staining showed an attenuation of the inflammatory response in the group of rats that underwent treatment with BB-94. Morphologic examination also revealed that the control of the inflammatory response correlated with the areas of elastin preservation.\nMMP inhibition with BB-94 limited the expansion of AAAs in this rat model. BB-94 appears to work not only as a direct pharmacologic inhibitor of MMPs but also as an interference with the inflammatory response seen in AAAs. Control of the inflammatory response was an unexpected result and may be related to the alterations in feedback mechanisms that are related to extracellular matrix degradation. Because this class of drugs is presently being developed to control the MMP inflammatory response seen with arthritis, these drugs also may ultimately serve as a pharmacologic treatment for patients with AAAs.",

    "abstract": "Previous investigators have identified disease-specific elevations of metalloelastase-9 (MMP-9) in aneurysm tissue biopsies. We hypothesized that circulating MMP-9 might also be elevated in patients with aneurysms. The purpose of this study was to compare plasma and aortic tissue MMP-9 levels in patients with infrarenal aneurysms (AAAs), patients with symptomatic aortoiliac occlusive disease (AOD), and healthy patients.\nA sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure plasma MMP-9 in patients with AAA (n = 22; mean age, 72.7 years), with AOD (n = 9; mean age, 60.5 years), and without disease (n = 8; mean age, 35.3 years). The MMP-9 levels also were measured in 48-hour supernatants of organ culture tissue explants from patients with AAA (n = 10; mean age, 66.2 years) and AOD (n = 5; mean age, 50.4 years) and organ donors (n = 7; mean age, 48.1 years). The results were reported as the mean +/- the standard error of the mean and analyzed with analysis of variance with multivariate regression.\nThe plasma MMP-9 levels were significantly higher in the patients with AAA (85.66 ng/mL +/- 11.64) than in the patients with AOD (25.75 ng/mL +/- 4.159; P <.001) or the healthy patients (13.16 ng/mL +/- 1. 94; P <.001). No significant difference in plasma MMP-9 levels between patients with AOD and healthy patients was identified. The patients with multiple aneurysms had significantly higher levels of plasma MMP-9 than did the patients with an isolated AAA (134.68 ng/mL +/- 17.5 vs 71.03 ng/mL +/- 10.7; P <.04). In organ culture, AAA and AOD tissue explants produced significantly higher levels of MMP-9 (3218.5 ng/gm +/- 1115.2 and 1283.1 ng/gm +/- 310.6 aortic tissue) than did disease-free explants (6.14 ng/gm +/- 2.3 aortic tissue; P <.0001). No significant difference in MMP-9 production between AAA and AOD explants was identified.\nPlasma MMP-9 levels are significantly higher in patients with AAA than in patients with AOD or in healthy volunteers. The patients with multiple aneurysms have higher levels than those patients with an isolated AAA. Organ culture studies suggest that diseased aortic tissue is the source of MMP-9.",

    "abstract": "The value of ultrasonic plaque characteristics in identifying patients at \"high-risk\" of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was studied.\nThirty-one arterial stenoses (6 common iliac, 2 external iliac, 1 profunda femoris, 21 superficial femoral, and 1 popliteal) in 17 patients who underwent angioplasty were studied by means of duplex scanning. With a computer-based program, B-mode images were digitized and normalized using 2 reference points, blood and adventitia. A grey level of 0 to 5 was allocated for the lumen (blood) and 180 to 190 for the adventitia on a linear gray scale of 0 to 255 (0 = absolutely black; 255 = absolutely white), and the overall plaque gray-scale median (GSM) of the pixels of the plaque was used as a measure of plaque echodensity. After PTA, follow-up of stenoses was done on day 1, weekly for 8 weeks, at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The total plaque thickness (sum of anterior and posterior components), minimal luminal diameter (MLD), and peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) were measured for all stenoses. An increase of more than 2 in the PSVR was the duplex criterion used to signify restenosis.\nThe GSM of the stenoses before angioplasty ranged from 6 to 71 (mean, 31.3 +/- 17.9); 17 stenoses had a GSM less than 25 (mean, 18.7 +/- 5.3), and 14 had a GSM more than 25 (mean, 46.4 +/- 15.8). When the GSM was less than 25, the absolute reduction in plaque thickness on day 1 post-PTA was 3.3 +/- 1.8 mm, in contrast to 1.8 +/- 1.6 mm when GSM was more than 25 (P <.03). The restenosis rate (PSVR more than 2) was 41% at 6 months and remained unchanged at 1 year. When the GSM was less than 25, restenosis occurred in 11% of lesions, in comparison with 78% when the GSM was more than 25 (P <.001).\nPlaque echodensity can be used to evaluate stenoses before PTA, to predict initial success and identify a subgroup that has a high prevalence of restenosis. The identification of a group at \"high-risk\" of restenosis can improve the selection of patients for the procedure and also be used in prospective studies on the prevention of restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Arteriography is the diagnostic test of choice before lower extremity revascularization, because it is a means of pinpointing stenotic or occluded arteries and defining optimal sites for the origin and termination of bypass grafts. We evaluated whether a duplex ultrasound scan, used as an alternative to arteriography, could be used as a means of accurately predicting the proximal and distal anastomotic sites in patients requiring peripheral bypass grafts and, therefore, replace standard preoperative arteriography.\nForty-one patients who required infrainguinal bypass grafts underwent preoperative duplex arterial mapping (DAM). Based on these studies, an observer blinded to the operation performed predicted what operation the patient required and the best site for the proximal and distal anastomoses. These predictions were compared with the actual anastomotic sites chosen by the surgeon.\nWhether a femoropopliteal or an infrapopliteal bypass graft was required was predicted correctly by means of DAM in 37 patients (90%). In addition, both anastomotic sites in 18 of 20 patients (90%) who had femoropopliteal bypass grafts and 5 of 21 patients (24%) who had infrapopliteal procedures were correctly predicted by means of DAM.\nDAM is a reliable means of predicting whether patients will require femoropopliteal or infrapopliteal bypass grafts, and, when a patient requires a femoropopliteal bypass graft, the actual location of both anastomoses can also be accurately predicted. Therefore, DAM appears able to replace conventional preoperative arteriography in most patients found to require femoropopliteal reconstruction. Patients who are predicted by means of DAM to require crural or pedal bypass grafts should still undergo preoperative contrast studies to confirm these results and to more precisely locate the anastomotic sites.",

    "abstract": "The development of carotid atherosclerosis after neck irradiation is well documented. There has been concern about the safety and durability of carotid artery repair through a radiated field. The objective of this report is to describe the immediate and long-term results of a series of cases collected in a 13-year interval.\nFrom 1984 to 1997, 24 patients underwent 26 carotid artery operations. All the patients had undergone prior radiation therapy at a mean interval of 17 years, with an average radiation dose of 6300 rad. Severe scarring of the skin or radiation fibrosis were present in two thirds of the patients, with 4 patients having permanent tracheostomies. The indications for carotid surgery included cerebral or monocular transient ischemic attack (58%), asymptomatic high-grade stenosis (27%), prior stroke (12%), and tumor invasion of the carotid artery (4%). General anesthesia was used with selective shunting on the basis of carotid artery back pressure or electroencephalography monitoring. Patch angioplasty closure was used in 79% of the patients. The operations included standard carotid endarterectomy (n = 20), external carotid endarterectomy (n = 2), carotid patch angioplasty alone (n = 2), aortocarotid bypass grafting (n = 1), and carotid interposition grafting (n = 1). Four patients required skin grafting or myocutaneous flaps.\nNo deaths or strokes occurred within 30 days of the operations. Six patients had transient cranial nerve palsy, and two had wound infections. The patients were followed from 1 to 156 months, with six patients being followed for longer than 18 months. No strokes were seen at late follow-up examination. Duplex scan examination documented one occlusion, in a patient with primary closure, and two restenoses, one of which necessitated reoperation. The remainder of the grafts were widely patent.\nCarotid surgery after neck irradiation is safe and durable. The long-term patency rates and the protection against subsequent neurologic events are similar to the results obtained in the absence of radiation therapy. Problems of wound healing were not found in this series.",

    "abstract": "With a diminishing rate of cardiac and neurologic events after carotid endarterectomy, intracerebral hemorrhage is gaining increasing importance as a cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality. To date, information has been largely anecdotal, and there has been no comparison with a control group of patients.\nThe records of all patients experiencing symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage after carotid endarterectomy were reviewed and compared with data from 50 randomly selected patients who did not experience intracranial bleeding. Univariate analyses were performed, using the Fisher exact test for dichotomous data and the Student t test for continuous data.\nDuring a 6-year period, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage developed in 11 (0.75%) of 1471 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, accounting for 35% of the 31 total perioperative neurologic events. Hemorrhage occurred a median of 3 days postoperatively (range, 0 to 18 days). Signs and symptoms included hypertension in all 11 patients, headache in 7 conscious patients (64%), and bradycardia in 6 patients (55%). Massive hemorrhage with herniation and death occurred in 4 patients (36%). Moderate hemorrhage developed in 5 patients (45%); 3 of these patients had partial recovery, and 2 had complete recovery. Petechial hemorrhage occurred in the remaining 2 patients (18%), 1 with partial and 1 with complete recovery. In comparison with the control group, there were no differences in respect to sex, indication for operation, smoking or diabetic history, and antiplatelet therapy or perioperative heparin management. Patients with intracranial hemorrhage were, however, younger, more frequently hypertensive, had a higher degree of ipsilateral and contralateral carotid stenosis, and had a higher rate of contralateral carotid occlusion.\nIntracranial hemorrhage occurs with notable frequency after carotid endarterectomy and accounts for a significant proportion of neurologic morbidity and mortality. Younger patients, hypertensive patients, and patients with severe cerebrovascular occlusive disease appear to be at greatest risk for the complication.",

    "abstract": "The ideal method of arterial reconstruction in operations for recurrent carotid disease after prior endarterectomy is unknown. The goal of this study was to review a series of carotid reoperations and to determine whether the surgical technique influenced the rate of perioperative stroke, late stroke, or secondary restenosis.\nA retrospective review was conducted of 82 carotid reoperations performed on 74 patients at our institution.\nThe patient population included 39 men (52.7%) and 35 women (47.3%), with a mean age of 67.5 years. The indications for redo surgery included transient ischemic attack or amaurosis fugax in 35.3% of the patients, stroke in 6.1%, and asymptomatic restenosis (>80%) in 58.5%. Patch angioplasty with or without redo endarterectomy was used in 47 cases (57.3%), with saphenous vein in 26 (31.7%), Dacron in 15 (18.3%), and polytetrafluoroethylene in 6 (7.3%). Interposition grafting was used in 35 cases (42.7%), with saphenous vein in 9 (11.0%), Dacron in 10 (12.2%), and polytetrafluoroethylene in 16 (19.5%). The perioperative complications included three strokes (3.7%). There was a trend toward increased perioperative neurologic complications with interposition grafting when compared with patch angioplasty (8.6% vs 2.1%), although this did not reach statistical significance. Long-term clinical follow-up was obtained in all cases with a mean duration of 35 months, with follow-up duplex scanning performed in 89.2%. The late failures of redo surgery included four significant secondary restenoses and five total occlusions. There was a trend towards improved long-term results with interposition grafting as opposed to patch angioplasty. However, the cases in which reconstruction was performed with a vein had a significantly higher rate of late failures (stroke, secondary recurrent stenosis, or occlusion) than those in which reconstruction was performed with any prosthetic material (26.7% vs 2.3%; P =.002 by Fisher exact test).\nThe use of autologous material for redo carotid surgery in any configuration appears to significantly increase the rate of subsequent recurrent stenosis or total occlusion of the operated artery. The reason for this finding is unclear but may be related to both host and technical factors. Prosthetic material may be more durable in the long-term for redo carotid surgery. Interposition grafting for redo carotid surgery may increase the perioperative neurologic complication rate to some degree; however, this was not statistically significant in this series. Interposition grafting may be a more durable solution in long-term follow-up than redo endarterectomy and patch angioplasty. A longer follow-up period will be needed to confirm this conclusion.",

One hundred eighteen primary and 26 recurrent stenoses (peak systolic velocity, >300 cm/s) in 52 tibial and 35 popliteal vein bypass grafts were identified by means of duplex scanning. The repairs consisted of 77 open procedures (vein-patch angioplasty, 28; vein interposition, 33; jump graft, 9; primary repair, 3) and 67 PTAs. No patient died as a result of intervention. Cumulative assisted graft patency rate (life-table analysis) was 91% at 1 year and 80% at 3 years. At 2 years, cumulative assisted graft patency rate was comparable for saphenous vein grafts (reversed, 94%; in situ, 88%; nonreversed, 63%) and alternative vein grafts (89%). Stenosis-free patency rate at 2 years was identical (P =.55) for surgical intervention (63%) and endovascular intervention (63%) but varied with type of surgical revision (P =.04) and time of intervention (<4 months, 45%; >4 months, 71%; P =.006). The use of duplex scan-monitored PTA to treat focal stenoses (<2 cm) and late-appearing stenoses (>3 months) was associated with a stenosis-free patency rate that was 89% at 1 year. After intervention, the alternative vein bypass grafts necessitated twice the reinterventions per month of graft survival (P =.01). Bypass graft to the popliteal versus infrageniculate arteries, site of graft stenosis (vein conduit, anastomotic region), and repair of a primary versus a recurrent stenosis did not influence the outcome after intervention.\nThe revision of duplex scan-detected vein graft stenosis with surgical or endovascular techniques was associated with an excellent patency rate, including when intervention on alternative vein conduits or treatment of restenosis was necessary. When PTA was selected on the basis of clinical and duplex scan selection criteria, the endovascular treatment of focal vein graft stenosis was effective, durable, and comparable with the surgical revision of more extensive lesions.",

    "abstract": "Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were monitored during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair to assess spinal cord ischemia and evaluate the subsequent protective strategies to prevent neurologic deficit.\nBetween January 1996 and December 1997, 52 consecutive patients with type I (n = 24) and type II (n = 28) TAAA underwent surgery (mean patient age, 60 years; range, 21-78 years). The surgical protocol included left heart bypass, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and monitoring transcranial myogenic MEPs. When spinal cord ischemia was detected, distal aortic pressure and mean arterial pressure were increased. By means of sequential crossclamping, MEPs were used to identify critical intercostal or lumbar arteries.\nReproducible MEPs could be recorded in all patients, and spinal cord ischemia was detected within 2 minutes. During distal aortic perfusion, 14 patients (27%) showed rapid decrease in the amplitude of MEPs to less than 25% of baseline, indicating spinal cord ischemia, which could be corrected by increasing distal aortic pressure. The mean distal aortic pressure to maintain adequate cord perfusion was 66 mm Hg; however, it varied among individuals between 48 and 110 mm Hg. In 24 patients (46%), MEPs disappeared after segmental clamping and returned after reattachment of intercostal arteries. In 9 patients (17%), MEPs disappeared completely, but no intercostal arteries were found. After aortic endarterectomy, 6 or 8 mm Dacron grafts were anastomosed to intercostal arteries, and MEPs returned after reperfusion. Using this aggressive surgical approach based on MEPs, no early or late paraplegia occurred in this series.\nMonitoring of MEPs is an effective technique to assess spinal cord ischemia. Operative strategies based on MEPs prevented neurologic deficits in patients treated for type I and II TAAA.",

During distal aortic perfusion, 14 patients (27%) showed rapid decrease in the amplitude of MEPs to less than 25% of baseline, indicating spinal cord ischemia, which could be corrected by increasing distal aortic pressure. The mean distal aortic pressure to maintain adequate cord perfusion was 66 mm Hg; however, it varied among individuals between 48 and 110 mm Hg. In 24 patients (46%), MEPs disappeared after segmental clamping and returned after reattachment of intercostal arteries. In 9 patients (17%), MEPs disappeared completely, but no intercostal arteries were found. After aortic endarterectomy, 6 or 8 mm Dacron grafts were anastomosed to intercostal arteries, and MEPs returned after reperfusion. Using this aggressive surgical approach based on MEPs, no early or late paraplegia occurred in this series.",

    "abstract": "Colonic ischemia and colonic resection occur frequently after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA). The purpose of this study was to identify the perioperative risk factors that might help to determine earlier in the postoperative period which patients are at risk for colonic ischemia and colonic resection.\nThe medical records of the 43 patients who underwent repair of rAAA from January 1989 to November 1997 were reviewed. The data were reviewed for the following factors: acidosis, pressor agents, lactate levels, guaiac status, cardiac index, coagulopathy, early postoperative bowel movement, the lowest intraoperative pH level, the temperature at the conclusion of the case, the location and duration of aortic cross clamping, the amount of fluid boluses administered after surgery, the amount of packed red blood cells administered during the case, and the average systolic blood pressure at admission and during surgery. Univariate analysis was performed with Fisher exact test, chi2 test, and Student t test. Multivariate analyses also were performed with the variables that were found to be significant on the univariate analysis.\nThirteen of the 43 patients (30. 2%) had colonic ischemia, and seven of the 13 underwent colonic resection (53.8%). The overall mortality rate was 51.2% (22/43) five of the deaths were intraoperative and excluded from the study. In a comparison of the patients who had colonic ischemia with those who did not, statistically significant differences were found in the following variables: average systolic blood pressure at admission 90 mm Hg or less, hypotension of more than 30 minutes' duration, temperature less than 35 degreesC, pH less than 7.3, fluid boluses administered after surgery 5 L or more, and packed red blood cells 6 units or more. Multivariate analysis indicated that the number of these variables present correlated significantly with the positive predicted probability of colonic ischemia occurring. No patient with two factors or fewer had an ischemic bowel, and the positive predictive probability of colonic ischemia for those patients with six factors was 80%.\nThe results of this study show that: (1) colonic ischemia after rAAA may be predicted with the presence of two or more specific perioperative factors, (2) the lack of a guaiac-positive bowel movement may be misleading for the early diagnosis of colonic ischemia, and (3) more than 50% of the patients with colonic ischemia will require a colonic resection. We recommend that any patient with rAAA with more than two perioperative factors undergo sigmoidoscopy every 12 hours after surgery for 48 hours to rule out colonic ischemia without waiting for early or guaiac-positive bowel movement.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to document the incidence rate of adverse events after endoluminal repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) during two successive periods of time.\nOne hundred ninety patients (175 men, 15 women; mean age, 72 years) underwent endoluminal repair of AAAs in a 5(1/2)-year period. Adverse events were documented prospectively for all the patients throughout this interval. An adverse event was defined as any of the following events: a death within 30 days, a conversion to open repair, the need for further intervention (either open or endovascular), the need for hemodialysis, a failure to cure the AAA, and wound complications. The patients were divided into two groups those who underwent operation in the initial 3-year period (group I; n = 75) and those who underwent operation in the subsequent 2(1/2)-year period (group II; n = 115). The results were analyzed for total adverse events for both periods of time and for difference in incidence rates within categories of adverse events between the two groups.\nEight patients (4.2%) died in the perioperative period. The endoluminal repair failed in 17 patients (8.9%), which necessitated a primary conversion to open repair at the original operation. In 88 patients, 110 adverse events occurred. There was no significant difference in the incidence rates of adverse events in patients in group I (37/75) and group II (51/115). Apart from primary conversion (P =.007), there was no significant difference in the incidence rates of adverse events between group I and group II within the following categories: perioperative (within 30 days) deaths, primary conversion, secondary conversion, supplementary endoluminal repair, intervention for lower limb ischemia, hemodialysis necessitated, failure to cure the AAA as a result of persistent endoleak, and wound complications.\nDespite improvements in technology and increasing experience, adverse events continue to occur in a relatively high proportion of patients (45%) who undergo endoluminal repair of AAA. Reporting the incidence rates of adverse events provides a more accurate picture of the morbidity rates of the endoluminal method rather than simply listing the procedures as successes or failures. The similarity in the incidence rates of adverse events in patients in group I and group II suggests that there are inherent risks in the endoluminal method rather than iatrogenic complications that occur during the learning curve with a new technique.",

    "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) has been shown to play a role in pulmonary injury after lower-extremity ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). However, its role in direct skeletal muscle injury is poorly understood. The hypothesis that endogenous TNF production contributes to skeletal muscle injury after hindlimb I/R in rats was tested.\nJuvenile male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 4 hours of bilateral hindlimb ischemia and 4 hours of reperfusion (IR) or sham operation (SHAM). A subset was treated with a soluble TNF receptor I construct (STNFRI, 10 mg/kg) 1 hour before ischemia (PRE) or at reperfusion (POST). Direct skeletal muscle injury (SMII) and muscle endothelial capillary permeability (MPI) were quantified by means of Tc99 pyrophosphate and I125 albumin uptake. Pulmonary neutrophil infiltration and hepatocellular injury were assessed by means of myeloperoxidase content (MPO) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations, respectively. Serum TNF bioactivity was measured with the WEHI bioassay.\nHindlimb I/R (IR vs SHAM) resulted in a significant (P <.05) increase in the SMII (0.52 +/- 0.06 vs 0.07 +/- 0.01) and MPI (0.35 +/-.04 vs 0.06 +/- 0.01). Pretreatment with STNFRI (PRE vs IR) significantly ameliorated both SMII (0.30 +/- 0.05 vs 0.52 +/- 0.06) and MPI (0.23 +/- 0.02 vs 0.35 +/- 0.04), whereas treatment at reperfusion (POST vs IR) had no effect. Hindlimb I/R (IR vs SHAM) resulted in both significant pulmonary neutrophil infiltration (MPO 16.4 +/- 1.06 U/g vs 11.3 +/- 1.4 U/g) and hepatocellular injury (AST 286 +/- 45 U/mL vs 108 +/- 30 U/mL), but neither was inhibited by pretreatment with STNFRI before ischemia. Detectable levels of TNF were measured during ischemia in a significantly higher percentage of the IR group compared with SHAM (9 of 12 vs 3 of 12), and the maximal TNF values were also significantly greater (51.1 +/- 12.6 pg/mL vs 5.5 +/- 2.9 pg/mL). No TNF was detected in any treatment group during reperfusion nor after administration of the STNFRI.\nAcute hindlimb IR initiates a systemic TNF response during the ischemic period that is partly responsible for the associated skeletal muscle injury.",

    "abstract": "We studied the effect of adenovirus-mediated p53 gene transfer on the injured rat carotid artery to determine its ability to decrease the formation of neointima.\nIn vivo gene transfer was used in isolated segments of balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Genetically modified adenovirus containing the gene encoding for wild-type p53 (AdWTp53) was applied in three concentrations: 8 x 10(10), 1.6 x 10(10), and 8 x 10(9) pfu/mL. Control rats received either adenovirus null (AdNull), 8 x 10(10) pfu/mL, or Medium-199 solution (vehicle). Expression of p53 was determined 4 days after gene transfer by Western blotting. Neointimal formation was assessed after 14 days by harvesting carotid arteries and determining the intima/media (I/M) ratio based on cross-sectional area measurement. Simultaneously, immunohistochemistry was done to detect the presence of p53 on smooth muscle cell nuclei.\nP53 expression was confirmed by Western blotting. There was a significant reduction in neointimal formation on all treated animals compared with controls. The highest dose of AdWTp53 (8 x 10(10) pfu/mL) resulted in a near-total arrest of neointimal formation (I/M = 0.09 +/- 0.03, mean +/- SEM) with P <. 0001 versus vehicle (I/M = 2.23 +/- 0.15) or AdNull (I/M = 2.12 +/-. 12). The intermediate dose of AdWTp53 (1.6 x 10(10) pfu/mL) resulted in an I/M value of 1.04 +/- 0.18, with P <.001 versus vehicle and P =.001 versus AdNull. The lowest dose (8 x 10(9) pfu/mL) resulted in an I/M value of 1.12 +/- 0.18, with P <.001 versus vehicle and P <. 002 versus AdNull. The immunohistochemistry was positive for the presence of p53 in rats infected with AdWTp53.\nAdenovirus-mediated gene transfer of p53 protein significantly decreases the formation of neointima in the rat carotid injury model.

    "abstract": "African Americans, especially African American women, have a greater risk of lower extremity ischemia that necessitates an infrainguinal bypass graft operation and amputation. Because the prevalence of diabetes mellitus is proportionally greater in this ethnic/racial group, the relative contribution of diabetes was compared with other potential risk factors.\nThis study was designed as a retrospective case control study at the University and Veterans Hospitals. In a 5-year period, 764 consecutive patients who required infrainguinal revascularizations were compared with a statewide population that was described by the 1995 Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System database. The main outcome measure was the requirement for infrainguinal revascularization.\nDiabetes mellitus was more common among African American women who underwent bypass graft operation (70%; odds ratio [OR], 24.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 20.3 to 30.4) than African American men (46%; OR, 11.6; 95% CI, 8.9 to 15.2), white women (49%; OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 13.0 to 19.5), or white men (42%; OR, 14.8; 95% CI, 12.5 to 17.4). Overall, bypass graft operation was associated more strongly with diabetes mellitus for all groups (OR, 15.7; 95% CI, 13.5 to 18. 3) than with smoking (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 3.8 to 5.2) or hypertension (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 4.0 to 5.3). Life-table analysis revealed limb salvage to be worse at 3 years among African American patients (64% vs 75%; P <.005) despite similar primary and cumulative secondary graft patency rates.\nDiabetes mellitus is the dominant risk factor that contributes to the need for bypass graft operation, especially among African American women. A greater prevalence of diabetes mellitus may account for the higher incidence of tissue necrosis and the increased requirement for distal bypass grafting and may contribute to the reduction in long-term limb salvage that was observed with these women.",

    "abstract": "Embolism is believed to be the major cause of end-organ damage after angioplasty and endoluminal procedures. Recently, Doppler ultrasound scanning has been used to detect asymptomatic cerebral emboli. We determined whether asymptomatic embolic signals (ES) could be detected distal to a significant iliac artery stenosis of >60% both before and soon after iliac percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).\nA 2-MHz Doppler scan probe was used to monitor for ES in the common femoral artery before and after 10 successful iliac artery PTAs and at various standardized times in the following 24 hours. The same protocol was used to study 10 patients in the control group after renal PTA. In addition, a single recording was performed in a second nonoperative control group of 10 patients who had no evidence of peripheral vascular disease. The Doppler scan signals were recorded on tape for a later blinded analysis.\nIn the 24 hours before iliac PTA, asymptomatic ES were detected in four of 10 patients during a 1-hour recording but in no controls (P =.025). After iliac PTA, ES were detected at 30 minutes in nine of 10 iliac subjects but in only one of 10 renal subjects (P =.0003) and at 2 hours in eight of 10 iliac subjects but in only one of 10 renal subjects (P =.001). The occurrence of ES became less frequent, and ES were present at a lower frequency in eight of 10 iliac PTA subjects at 4 hours and in five of 10 at 24 hours but in no renal PTA subjects at these time points.\nES can be detected in the common femoral artery with Doppler ultrasound scanning in patients with iliac artery stenosis both before and soon after iliac PTA despite preangioplasty aspirin and intra-angioplasty heparin therapies. The occurrences of ES were particularly frequent in the 2 hours after PTA. This technique can be used further to study factors that control plaque stability and to evaluate the effect of therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Hemodynamic alterations have been implicated as major stimuli for the development of intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts that are implanted in the arterial circulation. Tyrosine kinase is known to mediate cell signaling. However, its role with in vivo mechanotransduction is not yet well defined. We used a novel bioprosthetic collagen tube to provide an external support to vein grafts and examined the subsequent changes in hemodynamics, tyrosine kinase signaling, wall remodeling, and vasomotor function.\nCarotid interposition bypass grafting was performed with the reversed jugular vein in New Zealand white rabbits. In the experimental group (n = 15), after the completion of the proximal anastomosis, the vein was passed through a 4-mm collagen tube and the distal anastomosis was performed. The tube support was fashioned to completely cover the vein grafts. The control animals (n = 14) had no tube support. After surgery, the blood pressure and flow rate were measured and the wall tension and shear stress were calculated in the vein grafts on day 3 or day 28 (n = 5 per group). Tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed with the Western blot test in vein grafts at day 3 (n = 4 per group). The intimal and medial dimensions of the vein grafts were assessed with videomorphometry on day 28 (n = 5 per group). The cumulative dose response curves of the vein grafts to contractile and relaxant agonists were determined in isometric tension studies on day 28 (n = 5 per group).\nThe use of tube support reduced wall tension 1.7-fold (P <.01) and increased shear stress 4.8-fold (P <.001) without altering the flow rate or blood pressure. The tyrosine kinase activity was reduced 15-fold (P <.001) in the tube-supported vein grafts. The intimal thickness was reduced by 45% in the tube-supported vein grafts as compared with the control grafts (46 +/- 2 mm vs 84 +/- 5 mm, respectively; P <.0001), and the media thickness was reduced by 20% (63 +/- 8 mm vs 79 +/- 4 mm, respectively; P <.05). Isometric tension studies showed preservation of contractile function and modulation of endothelial-dependent dysfunctional relaxation in tube-supported vein grafts.\nThese results show that reduced wall tension and increased shear stress with an external tube support can effectively modulate the signaling, functional, and hyperplastic responses in vein grafts. We conclude that this simple strategy deserves further study and clinical consideration.",

    "abstract": "The activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways in vascular smooth muscle is important for the prevention of vein graft spasm and neointimal hyperplasia. Cyclic nucleotide-dependent relaxation is associated with an increase in the phosphorylation of a small heat shock-related protein (HSP20). In this investigation, we examined the mechanisms by which HSP20 may modulate relaxation.\nThe relaxation responses of the bovine carotid artery smooth muscles were determined in a muscle bath. HSP20 phosphorylation was quantitated with isoelectric-focusing immunoblots. The association with actin was determined with coimmunoprecipitation and cosedimentation. Molecular sieving columns were used to examine the macromolecular associations of HSP20.\nThe activation of cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways leads to the complete relaxation of carotid smooth muscle. This relaxation response is associated with an increase in the phosphorylation of HSP20. Actin coimmunoprecipitated with HSP20, and the association of actin with recombinant HSP20 in vitro was phosphorylation-state dependent. Finally, HSP20 exists in large (>100 kDa) aggregates, which dissociate with the activation of cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways.\nThese data support a role of HSP20 phosphorylation in mediating smooth muscle relaxation, possibly via a direct interaction of large aggregates of HSP20 with the contractile elements.",

    "abstract": "By means of the technique of messenger RNA (mRNA) differential display, we previously isolated a partial DNA clone found to be down-regulated at the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) hyperplastic arterial anastomosis compared with the normal artery. The partial DNA gene sequence was found to be homologous with interferon gamma up-regulated protein (IGUP) first found in human psoriatic keratinocytes. We cloned the entire IGUP gene from human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to determine its regulation by gamma interferon (gamma-IFN) and other cytokines in cultured human VSMCs.\nBy means of polymerase chain reaction, the IGUP gene was amplified from a QUICK-Clone complementary DNA human aorta kit using 5' and 3' oligonucleotide primers to the known IGUP sequence. Immunohistocytochemistry studies compared normal artery and distal anastomotic IH. Human VSMCs were stimulated with 1000 U/mL of gamma-IFN, 5 ng/mL of platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), 3. 2 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor, 3.3 ng/mL transforming growth factor beta(TGF-beta), 10 ng/mL of vascular endothelial growth factor, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for zero, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Western blot analysis of lysates of the stimulated VSMCs was performed to determine up-regulation of IGUP.\nDNA sequencing confirmed the cloning of the entire coding region of the IGUP gene with 100% homology to the known IGUP DNA sequence. There was strong expression of IGUP in quiescent VSMCs and marked reduction of expression of IGUP in proliferating smooth muscle cells. gamma-IFN was the only cytokine, of the cytokines evaluated, to up-regulate production of IGUP in VSMCs.\nIGUP is a novel protein in VSMCs found to be down-regulated in areas of anastomotic IH, as compared with a normal artery. We have now shown IGUP to be up-regulated only by gamma-IFN in human VSMCs. IGUP may, therefore, be the intermediary for the known gamma-IFN inhibition of human VSMC proliferation.",

    "abstract": "The morbidity and clinical outcome of the failure to successfully repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm with Endovascular Technologies (EVT) grafts, resulting in explantation of the device, was assessed.\nThe records of all patients worldwide undergoing attempted endovascular repair with EVT devices from February 1993 to October 1997 were retrospectively reviewed. Of 669 patients, 19 (3%) were converted to open procedure with immediate explantation during the initial attempt at endovascular repair, and 27 patients (4%) required explantation at a later date, ranging from 1 day to 40 months. The incidence, morbidity, mortality, and effect on clinical outcome were evaluated.\nCauses of immediate conversion with explantation were: inaccurate deployment of the proximal or distal attachment systems (11 of 19; 58%); twists in the system (3 of 19; 16%); mechanism malfunction during deployment (4 of 19; 21%); and an aortic tear (1 of 19; 5%). Among the 27 patients undergoing late explantation, 20 (74%) did so because of persistent endoleaks. Three cases (11%) were performed because of aneurysm rupture, three (11%) because of graft occlusion, one because of aortic dissection (4%), and one (4%) because of graft migration into the aneurysm sac. The overall perioperative mortality rate was 11% (2 of 19) for immediate explantation and 7% (2 of 27) for late explantation. The average length-of-stay was 11 days for immediate explantation and 14 days for late explantation (NS). Complications included myocardial infarction (4%), pulmonary insufficiency (13%), wound infection (4%), and permanent renal failure (2%). There were no significant differences in the incidence rates of these complications between immediate and late explants. No cases of limb loss occurred. Median American Society of Anesthetists (ASA) classification was 3, and there was no correlation between ASA classification and mortality rate. Average operating time was 374 minutes for immediate explantation (including the time for the failed endovascular procedure) and 185 minutes for late explantation.\nImmediate and late explantation are infrequent events, occurring in 3% and 4%, respectively, of attempted EVT endovascular aortic stent placements. The mortality rate was higher for both immediate (11%; P <.05) and late (7%; NS) explantation when compared with the mortality rate of all patients undergoing EVT aortic endograft placement (1.5%). There does not appear to be increased long-term morbidity among patients undergoing successful explantation. Early recognition of the need to convert to open procedure, device improvement, and increased operator experience should continue to minimize the incidence of immediate and late explantation and their associated complications.",

    "abstract": "The results of a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter clinical trial that compared endovascular stent graft exclusion of abdominal aortic aneurysms with open surgical repair are presented. During an 18-month period, 250 patients with infrarenal aneurysms underwent treatment at 12 study sites-190 patients underwent endovascular repair using the Medtronic AneuRx stent graft (Sunnyvale, Calif), and 60 underwent open surgical repair. There was no significant difference in operative mortality rates between the groups. The patients who underwent stent grafting had significant reductions in blood loss, time to extubation, and days in the intensive care unit and in the hospital, with an earlier return to function. The major morbidity rate was reduced from 23% in the surgery group to 12% (P <. 05) in the stent graft group. There was no difference in the combined morbidity/mortality rates between the two groups. Primary technical success at the time of discharge for the patients with stent grafts was 77%, largely as a result of a 21% endoleak rate. At 1 month, the endoleak rate had decreased to 9%. There was no difference in the primary or secondary procedure success rates at 30 days between the surgery and stent graft groups. The primary graft patency rate at 6 months was 98% in the surgery group and 97% in the stent graft group. The aneurysm exclusion rate at 1 month and 6 months was 100% in patients who underwent surgery and 91% in patients who underwent stent grafting. Stent graft migration occurred in three patients and resulted in late endoleaks; each endoleak was corrected by means of endovascular placement of a stent graft extender cuff. There have been no aneurysm ruptures and no surgical conversions to open repair in the stent graft group. Stent graft repair compares favorably with open surgical repair, with a reduced morbidity rate, shortened hospital stays, and satisfactory short term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The superficial femoral-popliteal vein (SFPV) is a reliable conduit for aortoiliac, infrainguinal, and venous reconstructions. In this prospective study, we characterized the anatomic and physiologic changes in SFPV harvest limbs and their relationship to the development of late venous complications.\nSince 1990, we have studied 61 patients after harvest of 86 SFPVs at 6-month intervals with clinical examinations, lower-extremity venous duplex, and venous function tests. The CEAP system was used as a means of categorizing clinical changes.\nMean (+/- SEM) follow-up was 37 +/- 3 months. Less than one third of harvest limbs had edema without skin changes (C3). No patient had major chronic venous changes (C4 to C6) or venous claudication. There were no significant differences in limb measurements between harvest and non-harvest limbs, except in a subgroup of patients with unilateral harvest in which there was a small but significant (P =.046) increase in harvest limb thigh and calf circumference, compared with the opposite non-harvest limb. These clinical results were not affected by the presence or absence of an intact greater saphenous vein (GSV). Large, direct collaterals (4 to 6 mm in diameter) between the popliteal vein stump and profunda femoris vein (PFV) were seen by means of duplex ultrasonography in 29 harvest limbs (34%). The remainder appeared to have smaller, less direct collaterals to the PFV. Mild venous reflux with rapid cuff deflation was present at the popliteal or posterior tibial vein in nine of 79 harvest limbs (11%). Six of these nine limbs (67%) with reflux were clinical class C3, compared with only 19 of the 70 limbs without reflux (27%; P =.02). Ambulatory venous pressure (AVP) with exercise was significantly increased in harvest limbs (60 +/- 4.7 mm Hg), compared with non-harvest limbs (47.8 +/- 5.2 mm Hg; P =.049). The AVP recovery time of harvest limbs (14.0 +/- 1.0 seconds) was reduced, compared with non-harvest limbs (23.5 +/- 4.5 seconds; P =.02). AVPs (exercise) remained stable or decreased in six of 10 harvest limbs measured serially. Venous refill time in harvest limbs (15.1 +/- 1.1 seconds) was shortened, compared with non-harvest limbs (22.3 +/- 2. 1 seconds)(P =.002). Venous outflow obstruction measured by means of plethysmography was present in 93% of harvest limbs, compared with 36% of non-harvest limbs (P =.001).\nSFPV harvest results in minimal mid-term to late-term lower-extremity venous morbidity despite outflow obstruction. The most likely mechanisms preserving clinical status include the low incidence of mild reflux, the presence of collateral venous channels, and the lack of progression in abnormal harvest limb physiology. The absence of the ipsilateral GSV does not adversely affect clinical outcome.",

No patient had major chronic venous changes (C4 to C6) or venous claudication. There were no significant differences in limb measurements between harvest and non-harvest limbs, except in a subgroup of patients with unilateral harvest in which there was a small but significant (P =.046) increase in harvest limb thigh and calf circumference, compared with the opposite non-harvest limb. These clinical results were not affected by the presence or absence of an intact greater saphenous vein (GSV). Large, direct collaterals (4 to 6 mm in diameter) between the popliteal vein stump and profunda femoris vein (PFV) were seen by means of duplex ultrasonography in 29 harvest limbs (34%). The remainder appeared to have smaller, less direct collaterals to the PFV. Mild venous reflux with rapid cuff deflation was present at the popliteal or posterior tibial vein in nine of 79 harvest limbs (11%). Six of these nine limbs (67%) with reflux were clinical class C3, compared with only 19 of the 70 limbs without reflux (27%; P =.02). Ambulatory venous pressure (AVP) with exercise was significantly increased in harvest limbs (60 +/- 4.7 mm Hg), compared with non-harvest limbs (47.8 +/- 5.2 mm Hg; P =.049). The AVP recovery time of harvest limbs (14.0 +/- 1.0 seconds) was reduced, compared with non-harvest limbs (23.5 +/- 4.5 seconds; P =.02). AVPs (exercise) remained stable or decreased in six of 10 harvest limbs measured serially. Venous refill time in harvest limbs (15.1 +/- 1.1 seconds) was shortened, compared with non-harvest limbs (22.3 +/- 2. 1 seconds)(P =.002). Venous outflow obstruction measured by means of plethysmography was present in 93% of harvest limbs, compared with 36% of non-harvest limbs (P =.001).",

    "abstract": "Duplex surveillance of lower extremity reversed vein bypass grafts (LERVG) is a means of identifying patients at risk for occlusion. The perceived accuracy of duplex scan as a means of identifying stenoses has led many surgeons to perform graft revision on the basis of duplex scan alone. This may result in missing additional lesions that are threatening patency. To assess the role of duplex scan as the sole imaging method before revision of LERVGs, we reviewed consecutive patients undergoing revisions who underwent preoperative arteriography after identification of duplex scan abnormalities.\nDuplex scan results, operative reports, and preoperative arteriograms for patients undergoing LERVG revision from January 1990 to December 1997 were reviewed. A standard duplex scan surveillance protocol was followed, and attempts were made to survey the entire graft, including inflow and outflow. Duplex scan results were compared with the results of preoperative arteriograms and the operation performed to determine if all significant lesions were identified by means of duplex scan alone.\nTwo hundred five LERVG revisions were performed. The 5-year assisted primary patency rate was 91%. In 119 cases (58%), arteriography did not contribute significantly to duplex scan findings. Arteriography significantly contributed to operative planning in 86 cases (42%). In 38 cases (19%), only a low-flow state was identified by means of duplex scan, and a correctable stenosis was identified by means of arteriography. In 48 cases (23%), additional significant lesions corrected at operation were identified by means of arteriography. These included 26 inflow, 16 graft, and 8 outflow lesions. Arteriography was most useful as a means of determining the revision procedure performed when there were inflow lesions (P <.05) or when the proximal anastomosis was to the profunda or superficial femoral arteries (P <.05). All frequently performed bypass graft configurations had some discrepancy between arteriographic and duplex scan findings.\nAvailable data do not permit prediction of which LERVG are immune from missed lesions in a duplex scan surveillance protocol. This suggests to us that arteriography is mandatory before LERVG revisions.",

    "abstract": "Infrainguinal reconstruction traditionally has been reserved for patients with limb-threatening ischemia. Surgery for debilitating claudication, however, has been discouraged as a result of the perceived fear of bypass graft failure, limb loss, and significant perioperative complications that may be worse than the natural history of the disease. In this study, the results of infrainguinal reconstructions for claudication performed during the past 10 years were evaluated for bypass graft patency, limb loss, and long-term survival rates.\nData were collected and reviewed from the vascular registry, the office charts, and the hospital records for patients who underwent infrainguinal bypass grafting for claudication.\nFrom 1987 to 1997, 409 infrainguinal reconstructions were performed for claudication (9% of all infrainguinal reconstructions in our unit). The patient population had the following demographics: 73% men, 28% with diabetes, 54% smokers, and an average age of 64 years (range, 24 to 91 years). Inflow was from the following arteries: iliac artery/graft, 10%; common femoral artery, 52%; superficial femoral artery, 19%; profunda femoris artery, 16%; and popliteal artery, 2%. The outflow vessels were the following arteries: 165 above-knee popliteal arteries (40%), 150 below-knee popliteal arteries (37%), and 94 tibial vessels (23%). The operative mortality rate was 0%, and one limb was lost in the series from distal embolization. The primary patency rates were 62%, 77%, and 86% for above-knee popliteal artery, below-knee popliteal artery, and tibial vessel reconstructions at 4 years, and the secondary patency rates were 64%, 81%, and 90%, respectively. Cumulative patient survival rates were 93% and 80% at 4 and 6 years as compared with 65% and 52%, respectively, for infrainguinal reconstructions performed for limb salvage.\nInfrainguinal arterial reconstruction for disabling claudication is a safe and durable procedure in selected patients. These data indicate that concern for limb loss, death, and limited life span of the patients with this disease may not be warranted.",

A 15-year experience with 50 descending thoracic aorta to iliofemoral artery bypass grafts for aortoiliac occlusive disease is the basis of this report.\nFrom January 1983 to December 1997, patients who underwent bypass grafting procedures from the descending thoracic aorta to the iliac or femoral arteries were identified. Surgical indications, morbidity and mortality rates, primary and secondary patency rates, limb salvage rates, and survival rates were determined.\nFifty descending thoracic aorta to iliofemoral artery bypass grafting procedures were performed 24 (48%) for severe claudication, 22 (44%) for rest pain, and 4 (8%) for ischemic ulceration. A primary procedure was performed in 31 patients (62%) for complete occlusion (21 patients) and severe atherosclerotic disease (10 patients) of the infrarenal aorta. The indications for 19 secondary revascularizations (38%) were prior aortic or extra-anatomic graft failure in 17 cases and aortic graft infection in 2 cases.

There were 122 bypass grafting procedures (98 ipsilateral, 24 contralateral) and 60 arterial transpositions.\nOne death (0.5%) and 7 nonfatal strokes (3.8%) occurred, none in patients who were asymptomatic. Perioperative morbidity included four asymptomatic occlusions (2%), 6 myocardial infarctions (3%), 10 pulmonary complications (5%), and 2 graft infections (1%). Follow-up periods ranged from 1 to 190 months (mean, 53 +/- 5 months). Nineteen patients (10%) were lost to follow-up. Fifty-seven late deaths occurred, most from cardiac causes.

During the last 20 months, CAS was used in the management of 17 CRs (16 patients; 9 women and 7 men).\nThe 30-day stroke morbidity-death rate for all CEAs (n = 1065) was 1.4%; 11 strokes (1. 0%) occurred (4 major strokes with disability and 7 strokes with minor or no disability), and 4 deaths (0.4%) occurred (2 deaths caused by myocardial infarction, 1 caused by intracranial hemorrhage, and 1 caused by stroke). Operative management of CR (n = 16) included patch angioplasty in 12 cases (autologous vein patches in 10 cases and synthetic patches in 2 cases), whereas interposition grafting was used in 4 cases (saphenous vein in 3 instances and synthetic [polytetrafluoroethylene] in one case). No strokes or deaths were observed. One recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy occurred (6.2%). Among the 16 patients undergoing 17 CAS procedures, the technical procedures were accomplished in all patients. No strokes or deaths occurred. No recurrent restenoses (50% or greater) have been identified within or adjacent to the CAS procedures.\nCR caused by myointimal hyperplasia can be managed by operative techniques or CAS with comparable periprocedural complications. Although long-term follow-up will be required to determine the incidence of recurrent restenosis, CAS may become the preferred procedure in these cases. A randomized clinical trial ultimately will be necessary to determine the role of CAS, as compared with that of operative management.",

    "abstract": "The incidence rate of disease progression and stroke after the diagnosis of a moderate (50% to 79%) carotid stenosis was determined by means of color-flow duplex scanning.\nDuring a 4-year period, 344 male veterans with moderate internal carotid artery stenoses, on one or both sides, were examined at regular intervals for a mean period of 25 months. Carotid color-flow scans were obtained semiannually. Clinical follow-up was performed to determine the incidence rate of amaurosis fugax, transient ischemic attacks, nonhemispheric symptoms, and strokes.\nNew neurologic symptoms developed in 75 patients (21.8%). Fifty-one (14.8%) had ipsilateral symptoms during follow-up: 18 amaurosis fugax (5.2%), 14 transient ischemic attacks (4%), 5 nonhemispheric symptoms (1.4%), and 14 strokes (4%). Twenty-four patients (6.9%) had contralateral symptoms: 20 strokes (5.8%) and 4 transient ischemic attacks (1.2%). Life-table analysis showed that the annual rate of ipsilateral neurologic events was 8.1%, and the annual rate of stroke was 2.1%. Seventy-five patients (22%) died in the follow-up period. Disease progression to 80% to 99% stenosis or occlusion occurred in 71 of 458 vessels (15.5%). The internal carotid arteries that showed evidence of disease progression had a significantly higher initial peak systolic velocity (251 vs 190 cm/s; P <.0001) and end diastolic velocity (74 vs 52 cm/s; P < 0.0001). Black patients and patients with ischemic heart disease were at a higher risk for disease progression. We could not identify any atherosclerotic risk factors that reliably predicted patients in whom future ipsilateral neurologic symptoms were more likely to develop. However, there was an increased risk of stroke associated with progression of disease.\nPatients who are asymptomatic and who have moderate carotid stenoses are at significant risk for neurologic symptoms and death, but have a relatively low incidence rate of ipsilateral events. The initial flow characteristics in the stenotic vessel are predictive of future disease progression, but they are not helpful in identifying patients in whom symptoms will develop.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to delineate the natural history of the progression of asymptomatic carotid stenosis.\nIn a 10-year period, 1701 carotid arteries in 1004 patients who were asymptomatic were studied with serial duplex scans (mean follow-up period, 28 months; mean number of scans, 2.9/patient). At each visit, stenoses of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the external carotid artery (ECA) were categorized as none (0 to 14%), mild (15% to 49%), moderate (50% to 79%), severe (80% to 99%), preocclusive, or occluded. Progression was defined as an increase in ICA stenosis to >/=50% for carotid arteries with a baseline of <50% or as an increase to a higher category of stenosis if the baseline stenosis was >/=50%. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for data analysis.\nThe risk of progression of ICA stenosis increased steadily with time (annualized risk of progression, 9.3%). With multivariate modeling, the four most important variables that affected the progression (P <.02) were baseline ipsilateral ICA stenosis >/=50% (relative risk [RR], 3.34), baseline ipsilateral ECA stenosis >/=50% (RR, 1.51), baseline contralateral ICA stenosis >/=50% (RR, 1.41), and systolic pressure more than 160 mm Hg (RR, 1. 37). Ipsilateral neurologic ischemic events (stroke/transient ischemic attack) occurred in association with 14.0% of the carotid arteries that were studied. The progression of ICA stenosis correlated with these events (P <.001), but baseline ICA stenosis was not a significant predictor.\nIn contrast to recently published studies, we found that the risk of progression of carotid stenosis is substantial and increases steadily with time. Baseline ICA stenosis was the most important predictor of the progression, but baseline ECA stenosis also was identified as an important independent predictor. Contralateral ICA stenosis and systolic hypertension were additional significant predictors. We found further that the progression of ICA stenosis correlated with ischemic neurologic events but not baseline stenosis. The data provide justification for the use of serial duplex scans to follow carotid stenosis and suggest that different follow-up intervals may be appropriate for different patient subgroups.",

Conducting a clinical investigation may require an approved IDE application. The US Food and Drug Administration encourages early interaction with the agency through the pre-IDE process during the development of a device or technology and during the preparation of an IDE application. This facilitates approval of the IDE application and progression into the clinical investigation. This paper reviews the terminology and applicability of the IDE regulation and the type of study that requires an IDE application to the Food and Drug Administration. The pre-IDE process and the development of an IDE application for a significant risk study of a cardiovascular device are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Occlusion of arteriovenous malformations of the brain (BAVMs) by means of an endovascular approach with liquid acrylate glue is an established treatment modality. The specific hazards of this procedure are related to the central nervous system. In the case of unexpectedly rapid polymerization of the cyanoacrylate glue and adhesion of the delivering microcatheter to the BAVM, severing the catheter at the site of vascular access is considered an acceptable and safe management. We present a unique complication related to this technique that has not been described yet. Fragmentation and migration of the microcatheter, originally left in place, had caused popliteal artery occlusion, which required saphenous vein interposition, in a 25-year-old man. Suggestions for avoiding this complication are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Adenovirus-mediated arterial gene transfer is a promising tool in the study of vascular biology and the development of vascular gene therapy. However, intraluminal delivery of adenoviral vectors causes vascular inflammation and neointimal formation. Whether these complications could be avoided and gene transfer efficiency maintained by means of delivering adenoviral vectors via the adventitia was studied.\nReplication-defective adenoviral vectors encoding a beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) gene (AdRSVnLacZ) or without a recombinant gene (AdNull) were infused into the lumen or the adventitia of rabbit carotid arteries. Two days after infusion of either AdRSVnLacZ (n = 8 adventitial, n = 8 luminal) or AdNull (n = 4 luminal), recombinant gene expression was quantitated by histochemistry (performed on tissue sections) and with a beta-gal activity assay (performed on vessel extracts). Inflammation caused by adenovirus infusion was assessed 14 days after infusion of either AdNull (n = 6) or vehicle (n = 6) into the carotid adventitia. Inflammation was assessed by means of examination of histologic sections for the presence of neointimal formation and infiltrating T cells and for the expression of markers of vascular cell activation (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1). To measure the systemic immune response to adventitial infusion of adenovirus, plasma samples (n = 3) were drawn 14 days after infusion of AdNull and assayed for neutralizing antibodies.\nTwo days after luminal infusion of AdRSVnLacZ, approximately 30% of luminal endothelial cells expressed beta-gal. Similarly, 2 days after infusion of AdRSVnLacZ to the adventitia, approximately 30% of adventitial cells expressed beta-gal. beta-gal expression was present in the carotid adventitia, the internal jugular vein adventitia, and the vagus nerve perineurium. Elevated beta-gal activity (50- to 80-fold more than background; P <.05) was detected in extracts made from all AdRSVnLacZ-transduced arteries. The amount of recombinant protein expression per vessel did not differ significantly between vessels transduced via the adventitia (17.1 mU/mg total protein [range, 8.1 to 71.5]) and those transduced via a luminal approach (10.0 mU/mg total protein [range, 3.9 to 42.6]). Notably, adventitial delivery of AdNull did not cause neointimal formation. In addition, vascular inflammation in arteries transduced via the adventitia (ie, T-cell infiltrates and ICAM-1 expression) was confined to the adventitia, sparing both the intima and media. Antiadenoviral neutralizing antibodies were present in all rabbits after adventitial delivery of AdNull.\nInfusion of adenoviral vectors into the carotid artery adventitia achieves recombinant gene expression at a level equivalent to that achieved by means of intraluminal vector infusion. Because adventitial gene transfer can be performed by means of direct application during open surgical procedures, this technically simple procedure may be more clinically applicable than intraluminal delivery. Moreover, despite the generation of a systemic immune response, adventitial infusion had no detectable pathologic effects on the vascular intima or media. For these reasons, adventitial gene delivery may be a particularly useful experimental and clinical tool.",

The objective of the current study was to investigate the capability of HIFU to stop bleeding after a more severe type of vascular injury, namely longitudinal incisions of arteries and veins.\nThe superficial femoral arteries, common femoral arteries, carotid arteries, and jugular veins of four anesthetized pigs were exposed surgically. A longitudinal incision, 2 to 8 mm in length, was produced in the vessel. HIFU treatment was applied within 5 seconds of the onset of the bleeding. The HIFU probe consisted of a high-power, 3.5-MHz, piezoelectric transducer with an ellipsoidal focal spot that was 1 mm in cross section and 9 mm in axial dimension. The entire incision area was scanned with the HIFU beam at a rate of 15 to 25 times/second and a linear displacement of 5 to 10 mm. A total of 76 incisions and HIFU treatments were performed.\nControl of bleeding (major hemosatsis) was achieved in all 76 treatments, with complete hemostasis achieved in 69 treatments (91%). The average treatment times of major and complete hemostasis were 17 and 25 seconds, respectively. After the treatment, 74% of the vessels in which complete hemostasis was achieved were patent with distal blood flow and 26% were occluded. The HIFU-treated vessels showed a consistent coagulation of the adventitia surrounding the vessels, with a remarkably localized injury to the vessel wall. Extensive fibrin deposition at the treatment site was observed.\nHIFU may provide a useful method of achieving hemostasis for arteries and veins in a variety of clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are associated with chronic inflammation, disruption of medial elastin, and increased local production of elastolytic matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The purpose of this study was to investigate how treatment with a hydroxamate-based MMP antagonist (RS 132908) might affect the development of experimental AAAs.\nMale Wistar rats underwent intraluminal perfusion of the abdominal aorta with 50 units of porcine pancreatic elastase followed by treatment for 14 days with RS 132908 (100 mg/kg/day subcutaneously; n = 8) or with vehicle alone (n = 6). The external aortic diameter (AD) was measured in millimeters before elastase perfusion and at death, with AAA defined as an increase in AD (DeltaAD) of at least 100%. Aortic wall elastin and collagen concentrations were measured with assays for desmosine and hydroxyproline, and fixed aortic tissues were examined by light microscopy.\nAAAs developed in all vehicle-treated rats, with a mean AD (+/- SE) that increased from 1.60 +/- 0.03 mm before perfusion to 5.98 +/- 1.02 mm on day 14 (DeltaAD = 276.4 +/- 67.7%). AAAs developed in only five of eight animals (62.5%) after MMP inhibition, with a mean AD that increased from 1.56 +/- 0.05 mm to 3.59 +/- 0.34 mm (DeltaAD = 128.1 +/- 18.7%; P <.05, vs vehicle). The overall inhibition of aortic dilatation attributable to RS 132908 was 53.6 +/- 6.8%. Aortic wall desmosine fell by 85.4% in the vehicle-treated rats (1210.6 +/- 87.8 pmol/sample to 176.7 +/- 33.4 pmol/sample; P <.05) but only by 65.6% in the animals treated with RS 312908 (416.2 +/- 120.5 pmol/sample). In contrast, hydroxyproline was not significantly affected by either elastase perfusion or drug treatment. Microscopic examination revealed the preservation of pericellular elastin and a greater degree of fibrocollagenous wall thickening after MMP inhibition, with no detectable difference in the extent of inflammation.\nSystemic MMP inhibition suppresses aneurysmal dilatation in the elastase-induced rodent model of AAA. Consistent with its direct inhibitory effect on various MMPs, RS 132908 promotes the preservation of aortic elastin and appears to enhance a profibrotic response within the aortic wall. Hydroxamate-based MMP antagonists may therefore be useful in the development of pharmacologic approaches to the suppression of AAAs.",

    "abstract": "Mannitol is used as a treatment for skeletal muscle ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in humans, despite the fact that its effectiveness in vivo is still disputed. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of mannitol in attenuating I/R injury at the microcirculatory level.\nThe study was designed as an experimental study with male Wistar rats. The main outcome measures were intravital microscopy, which was used to measure capillary perfusion, capillary and venular red blood cell velocity (VRBC), and leukocyte-endothelial interactions in the extensor digitorum longus muscle of the rat hind limb before and after ischemia. In addition, tissue injury was assessed during reperfusion with the fluorescent vital dyes bisbenzimide and ethidium bromide. Dimethyl thiourea (DMTU), a highly effective therapeutic agent of experimental I/R injury, was used as a positive control.\nNo-flow ischemia (2 hour) resulted in a 40% drop in capillary perfusion, a decline in capillary and venular VRBC, and increased leukocyte venular adherence and tissue infiltration. Tissue injury increased to a constant level during reperfusion. Mannitol attenuated capillary malperfusion during the first 60 minutes of reperfusion and prevented a decline in capillary VRBC. However, mannitol did not reduce tissue injury or leukocyte adherence and infiltration during reperfusion. By comparison, DMTU not only prevented the perfusion deficits and the increases in leukocyte venular adherence and tissue infiltration but significantly reduced the magnitude of tissue injury.\nOur findings suggest that mannitol may be of limited value for the prevention of early reperfusion-induced injury after no-flow ischemia in skeletal muscle. By comparison, DMTU was highly efficacious by not only reducing microvascular perfusion deficits but by also reducing leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions and the incidence of cellular injury.",

    "abstract": "To determine the relevance of dilatations of the common femoral artery (CFA), knowledge of the normal CFA diameter is essential. The diameter of the CFA in healthy male and female subjects of different ages was investigated.\nThe diameter of the CFA was measured in 122 healthy volunteers (59 male, 63 female; 8 to 81 years of age) with echo-tracking B-mode ultrasound scan. The influence of age, sex, height, weight, body surface area (BSA), and systolic blood pressure was analyzed by means of a multiple regression model.\nThe CFA increased steadily in diameter throughout life. From 25 years onwards, the diameter was larger in men than in women. Significant correlations were found between the CFA diameter and weight (r = 0.58 and r = 0.57 in male and female subjects, respectively; P <.0001), height (r = 0.49 and r = 0.54 in male and female subjects, respectively; P <.0001), and BSA (r = 0.60 and r = 0.62 in male and female subjects, respectively; P <.0001). Age and BSA were used to create a model for prediction of the CFA diameter (r = 0.71 and r = 0.77 in male and female subjects, respectively; P <.0001).\nThe diameter of the CFA increases with age, initially during growth but also in adults. This is related to age, body size, and sex male subjects have larger arteries than female subjects. It is now possible to predict the normal CFA diameter, and nomograms that may be used in the study of aneurysmal disease are presented.",

    "abstract": "The safety, feasibility, and early efficacy of subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS) for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency were established in a preliminary report. The long-term clinical outcome and the late complications after SEPS are as yet undetermined.\nThe North American Subfascial Endoscopic Perforator Surgery registry collected information on 148 SEPS procedures that were performed in 17 centers in the United States and Canada between August 1, 1993, and February 15, 1996. The data analysis in this study focused on mid-term outcome in 146 patients.\nOne hundred forty-six patients (79 men and 67 women; mean age, 56 years; range, 27 to 87 years) underwent SEPS. One hundred and one patients (69%) had active ulcers (class 6), and 21 (14%) had healed ulcers (class 5). One hundred and three patients (71%) underwent concomitant venous procedures (stripping, 70; high ligation, 17; varicosity avulsion alone, 16). There were no deaths or pulmonary embolisms. One deep venous thrombosis occurred at 2 months. The follow-up periods averaged 24 months (range, 1 to 53 months). Cumulative ulcer healing at 1 year was 88% (median time to healing, 54 days). Concomitant ablation of superficial reflux and lack of deep venous obstruction predicted ulcer healing (P <.05). Clinical score improved from 8.93 to 3.98 at the last follow-up (P <. 0001). Cumulative ulcer recurrence at 1 year was 16% and at 2 years was 28% (standard error, < 10%). Post-thrombotic limbs had a higher 2-year cumulative recurrence rate (46%) than did those limbs with primary valvular incompetence (20%; P <.05). Twenty-eight of the 122 patients (23%) who had class 5 or class 6 ulcers before surgery had an active ulcer at the last follow-up examination.\nThe interruption of perforators with ablation of superficial reflux is effective in decreasing the symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency and rapidly healing ulcers. Recurrence or new ulcer development, however, is still significant, particularly in post-thrombotic limbs. The reevaluation of the indications for SEPS is warranted because operations in patients without previous deep vein thrombosis are successful but operations in those patients with deep vein thrombosis are less successful. Operations on patients with deep vein occlusion have poor outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of sclerosing agents for the treatment of telangiectasias and reticular veins is well established. The injection of these agents is often associated with pain, and it is not uncommon for sclerotherapists to include lidocaine with the sclerosants in an attempt to reduce the pain associated with treatment. However, there are concerns that this may reduce the overall efficacy of the treatment because of dilution of the sclerosant. Patient comfort and overall outcome associated with treatment using HS with lidocaine (LIDO) versus that using HS alone was compared.\nForty-two patients were prospectively entered into the study and randomized blindly to sclerotherapy with 23.4% HS or 19% LIDO. Study subjects and treating physicians were blinded to the injection solution used. Injection sites were chosen for veins ranging in size from 0.1 to 3 mm. Photographs of the area to be treated were taken, and the patients rated their pain. They were then observed at regular intervals for four months, and clinical data was collected. Thirty-five subjects completed the full follow-up period, and photographs of the injected area were taken again. Three investigators blinded to the treatment assignment then evaluated the photographs and scored the treatment efficacy according to a standardized system.\nIn the HS group, 61.9% (13 of 21) patients rated their pain as none or mild, whereas 90.5% (19 of 21) of patients in the LIDO group had no or mild discomfort. This difference is significant, with a P value of.034. There was no difference in the overall efficacy of treatment between the two groups. The groups had similar rates of vein thrombosis and skin necrosis.\nAlthough lidocaine is often used with sclerosing agents, there are no previous reports in the literature to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing the pain experienced by the patient. In this study, patients receiving LIDO experienced significantly less discomfort at the time of injection than patients who received HS alone. There were no differences in the effectiveness of treatment or in the incidence of complications between the two groups.",

    "abstract": "Central venous obstruction is a common problem in patients with chronic renal failure who undergo maintenance hemodialysis. We studied the use of right atrial bypass grafting in nine cases of central venous obstruction associated with upper extremity venous hypertension. To better understand the options for managing this condition, we discuss the roles of surgery and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stent placement.\nAll patients had previously undergone placement of bilateral temporary subclavian vein dialysis catheters. Severe arm swelling, graft thrombosis, or graft malfunction developed because of central venous stenosis or obstruction in the absence of alternative access sites. A large-diameter (10 to 16 mm) externally reinforced polytetrafluoroethylene (GoreTex) graft was used to bypass the obstructed vein and was anastomosed to the right atrial appendage. This technique was used to bypass six lesions in the subclavian vein, two lesions at the innominate vein/superior vena caval junction, and one lesion in the distal axillary vein.\nAll patients except one had significant resolution of symptoms without operative mortality. Bypass grafts remained patent, allowing the arteriovenous grafts to provide functional access for 1.5 to 52 months (mean, 15.4 months) after surgery.\nBecause no mortality directly resulted from the procedure and the morbidity rate was acceptable, this bypass grafting technique was adequate in maintaining the dialysis access needed by these patients. Because of the magnitude of the procedure, we recommend it only for the occasional patient in whom all other access sites are exhausted and in whom percutaneous dilation and/or stenting has failed.",

    "abstract": "The feasibility and safety of combining carotid surgery and thrombolysis for occlusions of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the middle cerebral artery (MCA), either as a simultaneous or as a staged procedure in acute ischemic strokes, was studied.\nA nonrandomized clinical pilot study, which included patients who had severe hemispheric carotid-related ischemic strokes and acute occlusions of the MCA, was performed between January 1994 and January 1998. Exclusion criteria were cerebral coma and major infarction established by means of cerebral computed tomography scan. Clinical outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin scale.\nCarotid reconstruction and thrombolysis was performed in 14 of 845 patients (1.7%). The ICA was occluded in 11 patients; occlusions of the MCA (mainstem/major branches/distal branch) or the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) were found in 14 patients. In three of the 14 patients, thrombolysis was performed first, followed by carotid enarterectomy (CEA) after clinical improvement (6 to 21 days). In 11 of 14 patients, 0.15 to 1 mIU urokinase was administered intraoperatively, ie, emergency CEA for acute ischemic stroke (n = 5) or surgical reexploration after elective CEA complicated by perioperative intracerebral embolism (n = 6). Thirteen of 14 intracranial embolic occlusions and 10 of 11 ICA occlusions were recanalized successfully (confirmed with angiography or transcranial Doppler studies). Four patients recovered completely (Rankin 0), six patients sustained a minor stroke (Rankin 2/3), two patients had a major stroke (Rankin 4/5), and two patients died. In one patient, hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic infarction was detectable postoperatively.\nCombining carotid surgery with thrombolysis (simultaneous or staged procedure) offers a new therapeutic approach in the emergency management of an acute carotid-related stroke.

Arteries from patients with Buerger's tissue were analyzed histologically, including immunophenotyping of the infiltrating cells, to elucidate the nature of Buerger's disease as a vasculitis.\nThirty-three specimens from nine patients, in whom Buerger's disease was diagnosed on the basis of our clinical and angiographic criteria between 1980 and 1995 at Nagoya University Hospital, were studied. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue with a labeled streptoavidin-biotin method.\nThe general architecture of vessel walls was well preserved regardless of the stage of disease, and cell infiltration was observed mainly in the thrombus and the intima. Among infiltrating cells, CD3(+) T cells greatly outnumbered CD20(+) B cells. CD68(+) macrophages or S-100(+) dendritic cells were detected, especially in the intima during acute and subacute stages. All cases except one showed infiltration by the human leukocyte antigen-D region (HLA-DR) antigen-bearing macrophages and dendritic cells in the intima. Immunoglobulins G, A, and M (IgG, IgA, IgM) and complement factors 3d and 4c (C3d, C4c) were deposited along the internal elastic lamina.\nBuerger's disease is strictly an endarteritis that is introduced by T-cell mediated cellular immunity and by B-cell mediated humoral immunity associated with activation of macrophages or dendritic cells in the intima.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of late arterial abnormalities after aortic aneurysm repair and thus to suggest a routine for postoperative radiologic follow-up examination and to establish reference criteria for endovascular repair.\nComputed tomographic (CT) scan follow-up examination was obtained at 8 to 9 years after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair on a cohort of patients enrolled in the Canadian Aneurysm Study. The original registry consisted of 680 patients who underwent repair of nonruptured AAA. When the request for CT scan follow-up examination was sent in 1994, 251 patients were alive and potentially available for CT scan follow-up examination and 94 patients agreed to undergo abdominal and thoracic CT scanning procedures. Each scan was interpreted independently by two vascular radiologists.\nFor analysis, the aorta was divided into five defined segments and an aneurysm was defined as a more than 50% enlargement from the expected normal value as defined in the reporting standards for aneurysms. With this strict definition, 64.9% of patients had aneurysmal dilatation and the abnormality was considered as a possible indication for surgical repair in 13.8%. Of the 39 patients who underwent initial repair with a tube graft, 12 (30.8%) were found to have an iliac aneurysm and six of these aneurysms (15.4%) were of possible surgical significance. Graft dilatation was observed from the time of operation (median graft size of 18 mm) to a median size of 22 mm as measured by means of CT scanning at follow-up examination. Fluid or thrombus was seen around the graft in 28% of the cases, and bowel was believed to be intimately associated with the graft in 7%.\nLate follow-up CT scans after AAA repair often show vascular abnormalities. Most of these abnormalities are not clinically significant, but, in 13.8% of patients, the thoracic or abdominal aortic segment was aneurysmal and, in 15.4% of patients who underwent tube graft placement, one of the iliac arteries was significantly abnormal to warrant consideration for surgical repair. On the basis of these findings, a routine CT follow-up examination after 5 years is recommended. This study provides a population-based study for comparison with the results of endovascular repair.",

There were 260 primary lesions and 21 restenosis after a first PTA, which were analyzed separately.

Data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. Results were reported in an intention-to-treat basis. Clinical results and patency were evaluated by means of symptom assessment, ankle brachial pressure index, and duplex scanning at discharge and 1, 3, 6, and every 12 months after angioplasty. To identify factors that may affect outcome, 12 clinical and radiological variables, including the four categories of lesions defined by the Standards of Practice Committee of the Society of Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology, were analyzed separately. The statistical significances of life-table analysis of patency were determined by means of the log-rank test.\nThere were no postoperative deaths or amputations. Local, general, and vascular complications occurred in 2.1%, 1.3% and 4.7% of cases, respectively (total, 8.1%). The mean follow-up period was 29.6 months. The cumulative patency rates +/- SE of the 260 PTAs (including 55 PTAs plus stents) were 92.9% +/- 1.5% at 1 month, 86. 5% +/- 1.7% at 1 year, 81.2% +/- 2.3% at 2 years, 78.8% +/- 2.9% at 3 years, and 75.4% +/- 3.5% at 5 and 6 years. The two-year patency rate of 21 redo PTAs (including 11 PTAs plus stents) was 79.1% +/- 18.2%. Of 12 predictable variables studied in the first PTA group, only the category of the lesion was predictive of long-term patency. The two-year patency rate was 84% +/- 3% for 199 category 1 lesions and 69.7% +/- 6.5% for 61 category 2, 3, and 4 lesions together (P =. 02). There was no difference of patency in the stented and nonstented group.\nIliac PTA alone or with the use of a stent (in cases of occlusion and/or suboptimal results of PTA) offers an excellent long-term patency rate. Categorization of lesions remains useful in predicting long-term outcome. PTA can be performed safely by vascular surgeons in the operating room and should be considered to be the primary treatment for localized iliac occlusive disease.",

Forty-eight of 51 patients underwent the procedure of interest for the treatment of ischemic skin lesions (n = 42), rest pain (n = 3), disabling claudication (n = 1), and infected prosthesis (n = 2). The intervention used was infrainguinal composite artery-vein bypass grafting to popliteal (n = 18) and infrapopliteal (n = 30) arteries, with an occluded segment of the superficial femoral artery prepared with eversion endarterectomy and an autogenous vein conduit harvested from greater saphenous veins (n = 43), arm veins (n = 3), and lesser saphenous veins (n = 2). The main outcome measures, primary graft patency rates, foot salvage rates, and patient survival rates, were described by means of the life-table method for a mean follow-up time of 15.5 months.\nThe cumulative loss during the follow-up period was 6% and 24% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. The primary graft patency rates, the foot salvage rates, and the patient survival rates for patients with popliteal grafts were 60.0% +/- 9.07%, 75.7% +/- 9.18%, and 93.5% +/- 6.03%, respectively, at 1 month; 53.7% +/- 11.85%, 68.9% +/- 12.47%, and 85. 0% +/- 9.92% at 1 year; and 46.7% +/- 18.19%, 68.9% +/- 20.54%, and 53.1% +/- 17.15% at 5 years.

The results were compared with those of a study of primary isolated femoropopliteal bypass grafts (IFPBs).\nIFPBs were only constructed if the uninvolved or patent popliteal segment measured at least 7 cm in length and had at least one major collateral supplying the calf. When IFPB was performed for ischemic lesions, these lesions were usually limited to the digits or small portions of the foot. Forty-seven polytetrafluoroethylene grafts and three autogenous reversed saphenous vein grafts were used.\nAnkle brachial pressure index (ABI) increased after bypass grafting by a mean of 0.46. Three-year primary life table patency and limb-salvage rates for primary IFPBs were 73% and 86%, respectively. All eight IFPBs performed after failed tibial bypass grafts remained patent for 2 to 44 months, with patients having viable, healed feet.\nIn the presence of a suitable popliteal artery and limited tissue necrosis, IFPB can have acceptable patency and limb-salvage rates, even when a polytetrafluoroethylene graft is used.

    "abstract": "Circumstantial evidence suggests that arterial aneurysms have a different cause than atherosclerosis and may form part of a generalized dilating diathesis. The aim of this study was to compare the rates of spontaneous aneurysm formation in vein grafts performed either for popliteal aneurysms or for occlusive disease. The hypothesis was that if arterial aneurysms form a part of a systemic process, then the rates of vein graft aneurysms should be higher for patients with popliteal aneurysms than for patients with lower limb ischemia caused by atherosclerosis.\nInfrainguinal vein grafting procedures performed from 1990 to 1995 were entered into a prospective audit and graft surveillance program. Aneurysmal change was defined as a focal increase in the graft diameter of 1.5 cm or greater, excluding false aneurysms and dilatations after graft angioplasty.\nDuring the study period, 221 grafting procedures were performed in 200 patients with occlusive disease and 24 grafting procedures were performed in 21 patients with popliteal aneurysms. Graft surveillance revealed spontaneous aneurysm formation in 10 of the 24 bypass grafts (42%) for popliteal aneurysms but in only 4 of the 221 grafting procedures (2%) that were performed for chronic lower limb ischemia.\nThis study provides further evidence that aneurysmal disease is a systemic process, and this finding has clinical implications for the treatment of popliteal aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the longer term (up to 7 years) functional status and quality of life outcomes from lower extremity revascularization.\nThis study was designed as a cross-sectional telephone survey and chart review at the University of Minnesota Hospital. The subjects were patients who underwent their first lower extremity revascularization procedure or a primary amputation for vascular disease between January 1, 1989, and January 31, 1995, who had granted consent or had died. The main outcome measures were ability to walk, SF-36 physical function, SF-12, subsequent amputation, and death.\nThe medical records for all 329 subjects were reviewed after the qualifying procedures for details of the primary procedure (62.6% arterial bypass graft, 36.8% angioplasty, 0.6% atherectomy), comorbidities (64% diabetics), severity of disease, and other vascular risk factors. All 166 patients who were living were surveyed by telephone between June and August 1996. At 7 years after the qualifying procedure, 73% of the patients who were alive still had the qualifying limb, although 63% of the patients had died. Overall, at the time of the follow-up examination (1 to 7.5 years after the qualifying procedure), 65% of the patients who were living were able to walk independently and 43% had little or no limitation in walking several blocks. In a multiple regression model, patients with diabetes and patients who were older were less likely to be able to walk at follow-up examination and had a worse functional status on the SF-36 and a lower physical health on the SF-12. Number of years since the procedure was not a predictor in any of the analyses.\nAlthough the long-term mortality rate is high in the population that undergoes lower limb revascularization, the survivors are likely to retain their limb over time and have good functional status.",

We report a case of atraumatic, nonaneurysmal dissection of the popliteal artery that occurred in a 62-year-old man who was admitted with progressive right lower-extremity claudication. Preoperative arteriography was suggestive of arterial dissection, and surgical treatment was undertaken before irreversible ischemia developed. Intraoperatively, a dissection of the popliteal artery was observed, and the patient underwent femoral-popliteal bypass grafting with the ipsilateral, greater saphenous vein and the popliteal artery was ligated distal to the dissection. Spontaneous dissection limited to the popliteal artery has not previously been reported in the literature. Successful management depends on consideration of the diagnosis, particularly when other, more common diseases have been excluded.",

It can lead to disruption of anastomoses with life-threatening bleeding, thrombosis of the bypass graft, and systemic septic manifestations. One method to ensure adequate limb perfusion after removal of an infected aortofemoral graft is extra-anatomical bypass grafting. We used a minimally invasive, video-assisted approach to implant a crossover iliofemoral obturator bypass graft in a patient with infection of the left limb of an aortofemoral bifurcated graft. This appears to be the first case report describing the use of this technique.",

    "abstract": "The response of the upper and lower thoracic aorta to radial tensile stresses was compared with the response to circumferential and longitudinal stresses to understand the role of tensile stress in the tearing phase of an aortic dissection.\nSquare tissue samples (1.6 by 1.6 cm) were cut from the upper and lower segments of six porcine thoracic aortas and were elongated in the radial direction with a tensile testing machine. The radial extensibility of the thoracic aorta was compared with adjacent tissue samples that were tested in tension in the circumferential and longitudinal directions based on Young's modulus (ie, the ratio of tensile stress to strain).\nThe elastic properties of the thoracic aorta in the radial direction were markedly different from both the circumferential and longitudinal properties. The average Young's modulus (calculated immediately before failing) was significantly lower in the radial direction for both the upper and lower thoracic segments (61.4 +/- 4.3 kPa, SEM) than the Young's modulus of corresponding segments in the circumferential and longitudinal directions that were not tested to failure (151.1 +/- 8.6 kPa and 112.7 +/- 9.2 kPa, respectively; P <. 05). Sections 7 micrometer thick were collected from four samples obtained from one upper thoracic aorta that were strained at 0, 1.0, 2.5, and 4.0 and then stained either with Movat's pentachrome or with hematoxylin and eosin. Histological analysis of the samples stressed in the radial direction revealed that smooth muscle cells were torn loose from their attachments to each other and to adjacent elastin.\nAlthough the aorta normally functions under radial compressive stresses associated with lumen blood pressure, these results show that the aorta tears radially at a much lower value of stress than would have been predicted from previous studies that have reported longitudinal and circumferential Young's modulus. This could explain why dissections propagate readily once the initial tear occurs.",

    "abstract": "This study clarified the efficacy of low-dose FK506 and the possibility of discontinuing the use of FK506.\nFresh carotid arteries were allografted from ACI rats to Lewis rats. FK506 (0.2 mg/kg/day) was given intramuscularly from day 3 after transplantation until the rats were killed (group III), or it was given for 4 weeks and then discontinued (group IV). Isogeneic (group I) and allogeneic (group II) models served as untreated control groups. Grafts were harvested on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 70, and 105 after transplantation. Histological evaluation and measurement of the endothelial cell (EC)-covered area were performed by means of scanning electron microscopy.\nIn group I, ECs were denuded immediately after transplantation and subsequently regenerated within 2 weeks. In group II, after denudation and regeneration of ECs, massive leukocyte adhesion and subsequent destruction of regenerated ECs, followed by intimal hyperplasia, were observed. In group III, FK506 suppressed rejection almost completely, without intimal hyperplasia. In group IV, severe rejection and denudation of regenerated intima appeared 2 weeks after the use of FK506 ended.\nThe denudation and regeneration of ECs may play an important role in the process of rejection and graft performance. FK506 proved to be successful in rat arterial allografting, and ECs of donor origin could survive on the allograft as long as FK506 was effective; however, cessation of the use of FK506 resulted in severe destruction of intima. To prevent allograft failure, long-term administration of an immunosuppressant is essential.",

    "abstract": "Somatostatin analogs inhibit neointimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in vivo. The gene transfer of somatostatin to endothelial cells (ECs) represents a potential means of local delivery of somatostatin to areas of arterial injury. This study tested the hypothesis that the retroviral gene transfer of somatostatin to ECs would inhibit SMC proliferation in vitro and evaluated the effects of somatostatin analogs on DNA synthesis and the growth of SMCs.\nMedia transfer and coculture were used to determine the effects of somatostatin-producing ECs on SMC proliferation in vitro. The effects of a variety of somatostatin isoforms and analogs on the proliferation of SMCs, mitogenesis of serum-restimulated quiescent SMCs, and arterial explants were measured.\nDespite the production of biologically relevant concentrations of somatostatin by ECs, no inhibition of SMC proliferation was noted. Somatostatin analogs inhibited DNA synthesis in arterial explants but did not inhibit either DNA synthesis or growth of cultured SMCs, which showed a likely effect of somatostatin on the initial transition in SMC phenotype.\nSomatostatin exerts inhibitory effects on SMC proliferation only during the early transition to a proliferative phenotype. There are significant differences between this in vivo transition and the standard serum-restimulated model of cultured SMCs. These differences may account for the failure of somatostatin to inhibit SMC proliferation in the standard in vitro models.",

    "abstract": "Increases in the phosphorylation of a small heat shock protein (HSP20) are associated with cyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation. The effect of pressure and flow on vessel diameter was studied. We hypothesized that physiologic conditions that induce vasorelaxation would lead to increases in HSP20 phosphorylation.\nFlow-dependent changes in vessel diameter, at different intraluminal pressures, were measured with a laser optical micrometer in intact bovine carotid arteries. Experiments were performed in the presence and absence of norepinephrine (10(-5) mol/L). Increases in the phosphorylation of HSP20 were determined with isoelectric focusing immunoblots.\nThe increase in vessel diameter was most significant at low intraluminal pressures (20 mm Hg), high flow rates (200 mL/min), and in the presence of the vasoconstrictor norepinephrine (10(-5) mol/L). The addition of methylene blue (a guanylate cyclase inhibitor) completely inhibited flow-induced vasodilation. Under conditions in which maximal flow induced vasodilation occurred, there were significant increases in the phosphorylation of HSP20.\nFlow-dependent vasodilation in isolated perfused segments of bovine carotid arteries was maximal when the intraluminal pressures were low and when the vessels were precontracted with norepinephrine. Flow-dependent vasodilation was inhibited by methylene blue and was associated with increases in the phosphorylation of HSP20, suggesting that the vasodilation was mediated by endothelial production of nitric oxide.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports suggest that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) should not be performed in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) because of an unacceptable rate of perioperative stroke and other morbidity. Because these conclusions were based on a small number of patients, we reviewed the perioperative and long-term outcome of patients with ESRD and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) who underwent CEA at our institution.\nThe 1081 patients who had a CEA between 1990 and 1997 were cross-referenced with those patients in whom renal insufficiency had been diagnosed. These charts were reviewed for patient demographics and perioperative and long-term outcome. Patients undergoing CEA during a 1-year period (1993) served as controls.\nFifty-one CEAs were performed in 44 patients with CRI (32 in 27 patients) and ESRD (19 in 17 patients). In the CRI+ESRD group, 66.7% were symptomatic, and 70.7% of the control group were symptomatic. Six operations (11.8%) in the CRI+ESRD group were redo endarterectomies. There were no perioperative strokes in the CRI+ESRD group, but one patient died 29 days postoperatively because of a myocardial infarction, for a combined stroke-mortality rate of 2.0%. The control group had a 2.6% combined stroke-mortality rate. Long-term survival analysis revealed a 4-year survival rate of 12% for patients with ESRD and 54% for patients with CRI, compared with 72% for controls (P <.05).\nCEA can be performed safely in patients with ESRD or CRI, with perioperative stroke and death rates equivalent to that of patients without renal dysfunction. However, the benefit of long-term stroke prevention in the asymptomatic patient with ESRD is in question because of the high 4-year mortality rate of this patient population.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on ocular perfusion with the measurement of the ophthalmic artery (OA) and the central retinal artery (CRA) flow velocities with color-flow ocular duplex scanning (ODS). Ocular hemodynamics also were examined in a subset of patients with visual symptoms in an attempt to characterize the origin of the ocular symptoms and their response to surgery.\nTwenty-five patients with internal carotid artery stenoses (>/=70%) underwent 29 CEAs. All the patients underwent ODS for the measurement of the peak systolic velocity (PSV) in the OA and the CRA of the ipsilateral eye before and after CEA. The preoperative and postoperative flow velocities were compared in all the patients and in the patients with and without visual symptoms.\nThe preoperative PSV in the OA was 21.6 +/- 2.2 cm/s and in the CRA was 7.7 +/- 0.7 cm/s. These values were reduced as compared with normative values (OA, 37.8 cm/s; CRA, 10.7 cm/s). After CEA, the PSV increased significantly in both vessels (postoperative OA, 38.6 +/- 2.5 cm/s, P <.0001; postoperative CRA, 12.1 +/- 0.9 cm/s, P =.0008). Fifteen of the 29 CEAs were performed for visual symptoms. The patients with ocular symptoms had significantly lower preoperative PSVs in the CRA as compared with those patients without visual symptoms (CRA with ocular symptoms, 6.5 +/- 0.8 cm/s; CRA with no ocular symptoms, 9.4 +/- 0.9 cm/s; P =.02). The PSV in the OA was not significantly lower in the patients with ocular symptoms. Eight patients (28%) were found to have reversed OA flow before surgery, but only three patients had ocular symptoms. All eight patients had normal antegrade flow in the OA after surgery.\nSevere carotid stenosis may be associated with reduced ocular perfusion, which can be quantitatively evaluated with ODS. Reduced OA and CRA flow velocities are corrected with successful CEA. The patients with ocular symptoms were observed to have significant reductions in CRA flow velocities. Reversed flow in the OA was not a marker for ocular symptoms in this study. ODS can identify global ocular ischemia and may be helpful in the evaluation of patients with atypical visual symptoms or with amaurosis fugax and no evidence of retinal emboli.",

    "abstract": "This analysis of the outcome of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was performed during a period of transition from the frequent use of autologous greater saphenous vein grafting to the frequent use of Dacron graft patch reconstruction and from the infrequent use to the moderate use of eversion plication shortening of the endarterectomized internal carotid artery segment.\nFrom 1990 to 1997, 697 consecutive primary CEAs were performed on 326 men (61 bilateral CEAs) and 272 women (38 bilateral CEAs) with a mean age (+/- SD) of 68 +/- 9 years. The indications were transient ischemic attack in 31% of the patients, stroke or reversible ischemic neurologic deficit in 18%, global ischemia in 12%, and asymptomatic stenosis >/=70% in 39%. Patch reconstruction was performed in the 678 CEAs in which the arteriotomy extended distal to the internal carotid artery bulb (97%; 370 saphenous vein grafts, 308 Dacron grafts). Primary closure was used in the other 19 CEAs. Early in this series, saphenous vein patching frequently was performed, with a gradual transition to the frequent use of knitted Dacron grafts. Concurrent with this, the frequency of the shortening of the internal carotid artery increased from 7% to 40%. Postoperative duplex scans were obtained on 619 CEAs (91%).\nThere were four deaths (0.6%) in 30 days-three from myocardial infarction and one from hyperperfusion stroke. Thirteen strokes (1.9%), nine ipsilateral and four contralateral, occurred in 30 days. Four nonfatal strokes and one death occurred in the saphenous vein group (3.2%), and eight strokes and two deaths occurred in the Dacron graft group (1.4%; P =.16). The combined 30-day stroke or death rate was 2.3% (16/697), and the hospital rate was 1.7% (12/697). Of the three internal carotid artery occlusions, two were identified at 2 months (one Dacron graft, one saphenous vein) and one was identified at 1 year (Dacron graft). Nonocclusive (>/=50%) restenosis was identified in 16 CEAs. Fifteen of these were in the internal carotid artery. The cumulative Kaplan-Meier method of life-table analysis for the >/=50% restenosis rate at 2 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years for Dacron graft patched CEA was 1.7%, 2.3%, 8.8%, and 12.3% and for saphenous vein patched CEA was 0.3%, 0.3%, 0.3%, and 1.1% ( P <.0001). At the same time intervals, the >/=50% restenosis rate for internal carotid artery shortening was 1.0%, 2.5%, 13.7%, and 19.5%, and, when shortening was not done, the rate was 0.8%, 0.8%, 1.1%, and 3.1% (P <.0001). The >/=50% restenosis rate at the same intervals for women was 0.8%, 1.3%, 5.2%, and 8.9%, and, for men, the rate was 0.9%, 0.9%, 1.8%, and 2.5% (P =.11). Univariate analysis of the rate of >/=50% restenosis in 3 years for the 346 vein patched (2; 0.6%) and 186 Dacron graft patched (7; 3.8%) CEAs that did not have internal carotid artery shortening gave a P value of .015. Similarly, Kaplan-Meier method analysis of this subset of nonshortened CEAs gave a higher restenosis rate with Dacron graft patching (P =.012). With multiple logistic regression, the >/=50% restenosis rate was significantly associated with Dacron graft patching (P =.023; odds ratio, 4.5) and internal carotid artery shortening (P =.025; odds ratio, 3.1) and was weakly associated with female gender (P =.15; odds ratio, 2.0). Cox proportional hazards model analysis for >/=50% restenosis gave relative risk ratios of 3.0 (1.6 to 6.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]) for Dacron graft versus vein patching, 2.0 (1.2 to 3.3; 95% CI) for shortening versus not shortening, and 1.5 (0.9 to 2.4; 95% CI) for female versus male gender.\nCEA patching with Dacron grafts and saphenous vein grafts have similar low perioperative thrombosis, stroke, and death rates, although the stroke and death rates were slightly higher but not statistically different when Dacron grafts were used. Dacron graft patched CEAs are more likely to develop >/=50% restenosis than are those that are patched",

    "abstract": "Postoperative complications are mainly related to the surgical trauma derived from the extensive abdominal incision and dissection after a conventional aortofemoral bypass grafting procedure. In an attempt to reduce postoperative complications, a concept of video-endoscopic vascular surgery on the infrarenal aortoiliac artery has been developed. On the basis of our experience with the practicability of video-endoscopic vascular surgery in the pelvic region in an animal study and in a pilot study of human cadavers, the purpose of this report was to describe three different methods that we evaluated on human cadavers and that we partly applied to patients.\nIn this experimental study, three different approaches were used to perform video-endoscopic aortofemoral bypass grafting. We performed an observational trial on human corpses (n = 24) with the transabdominal-retroperitoneal approach (TARA), the extraperitoneal approach (EPA), and the transabdominal left paracolic approach (TAPA). The EPA also was applied to patients with aortoiliac occlusive diseases.\nThe TARA on cadavers (n = 4) soon was abandoned because it caused a burdensome sliding of the intestine into the operative field adjacent to the renal vessels, particularly in cases with obese subjects. In comparison, the TAPA (n = 6) with right-sided positioning of the patient retained the intestine in the right upper abdomen throughout the procedure. Until a surgeon actually is acquainted with the anatomic landmarks and the laparoscopic preparation technique, the EPA (n = 14) is a challenging procedure that necessitates thorough training. As with the TAPA, the EPA represents a procedure that reveals constant exposure of the operating field, even in cases with obese subjects. In the clinical observational study (n = 7), aortobifemoral bypass grafting was achieved totally laparoscopically with the EPA. The mean operating time was 6.5 hours and ranged from 3 to 10 hours. Blood transfusions were necessary after surgery in three patients (range, 1 to 3 red packed blood cells). One patient, who had had occlusion of the inferior mesenteric artery, died of ischemic colitis at postoperative day 10. The other patients had uneventful postoperative courses with minor wound discomfort.\nLaparoscopic vascular surgery seems to be a promising procedure to minimize postoperative complications. On the basis of our experience, we do not favor the TARA. Because it necessitates steep Trendelenburg positioning to displace intra-abdominal organs, the TARA is not an appropriate approach, particularly in obese and cardiopulmonary frail cases. Contrarily, the TAPA and the EPA deliver potentially better results in terms of exposing the operative field and thus reducing operating time and perioperative morbidity rates. A prospective cadaveric and clinical trial may be justified to further evaluate the use of these surgical techniques.",

    "abstract": "From January 1993 to May 1996, 108 patients (64 men, 44 women; mean age, 72 years; age range, 37 to 87 years) underwent 125 percutaneous transluminal angioplasties and stent implantations primarily for atherosclerotic lesions of the renal artery. Sixty-four patients underwent treatment for renovascular hypertension (two antihypertensive medications or more), 32 patients underwent treatment for a combination of hypertension and renal failure (serum creatinine level >/=1.6 mg/dL), and a small group of six patients (5%) without hypertension or diminished renal function underwent treatment to prevent the progression to renal artery occlusion and kidney loss. Thirty-three patients (31%) had renovascular hypertension that was classified as severe on three or more medications, 31 patients (29%) had renovascular hypertension that was classified as moderate on two medications, and 38 patients (35%) had renovascular hypertension that was classified in the mild group on a single antihypertensive agent. Stenotic lesions were located at the ostium of the renal artery in 82 cases (65%) and were ostial-adjacent (<5 mm from renal ostium) in the other 43 cases (34%). A total of 125 stents were deployed in 125 arteries (procedural success 97.6%). Renovascular hypertension either was cured or was improved in 73 patients (68%), with 14 patients (13%) considered cured (normotensive on no medications). The conditions of 29 patients (27%) were unchanged, and 6 patients (5%) had worsening hypertension after surgery. We were unable to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in serum creatinine levels after renal artery balloon angioplasty/stenting. Complications occurred in a total of nine cases (7.2%), six of which were related to technical problems. One patient had worsening renal insufficiency caused by contrast agent, and another patient had a perinephric hematoma develop that necessitated evacuation. There were four postoperative deaths (30-day mortality). Two of these deaths were caused by postoperative myocardial infarction. The other two patients had progressive renal failure develop that necessitated dialysis. These patients later died of the disease process despite supportive care. Follow-up renal artery duplex scan studies and angiograms were available on 96 patients (76%). The mean peak systolic renal/aortic ratio on duplex scanning was 2.2. Life-table analysis yielded a 74% primary patency rate and an 85% secondary patency rate at 36 months. This retrospective analysis showed the effectiveness of combining percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stent deployment for significant renal artery stenosis to treat renovascular hypertension.",

    "abstract": "The complication rate for patients who are dialysis dependent and infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the role of viral indicators (CD4 counts) as predictors of these complications are poorly characterized. To determine the influence of HIV status and viral activity on graft patency and infection rates, we retrospectively reviewed our results.\nBetween June 1993 and March 1997, the charts of 104 patients (HIV+, n = 42; HIV-, n = 62) who required 112 hemodialysis access grafts were reviewed. Of the 112 procedures, 55 (48%) were autologous arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) procedures (HIV+, n = 23; HIV-, n = 32) and 57 (52%) were prosthetic expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafting procedures (HIV+, n = 27; HIV-, n = 30). Transcutaneous catheter procedures were excluded from the study. The autologous AVF procedures consisted of direct and transposed AVFs. Patency rates were determined by means of life-table analysis. Infection rates and CD4 counts were compared with the chi2 test and the Fisher exact test. Significance was accepted at a P value of.05 or less.\nThe cumulative 12-month and 24-month patency rates for prosthetic grafts in patients who were HIV+ were 49% and 21%, respectively, versus 77% and 45% for patients who were HIV-. The differences in the prosthetic graft patency rates between these two groups were significant (P </=.05). The cumulative 12-month and 24-month patency rates for autologous AVF procedures did not differ significantly. The AVF procedure patency rates were 72% and 51%, respectively, in patients who were HIV+ versus 54% and 50% for patients who were HIV-. The prosthetic graft infection rate for patients who were HIV+ and HIV- were 30% and 7%, respectively ( P =.04). However, the infection rates in autologous AVF procedures did not differ between the groups (9% vs 0%; P>.05). The mean CD4+ cell counts were 174: CD4+ counts that were less than 200 did not correlate with or predict the development of infection (P >.05).\nOur data showed that prosthetic graft infection rates were increased and patency rates were decreased in patients who were HIV+ as compared with patients who were HIV- and HIV+ with autologous AVFs. There were no differences in patency rates or infection rates in patients who had undergone autologous access procedures. Long-term graft patency rates were not affected by HIV status, and CD4+ lymphocyte counts were not predictive of infection development. Because the prosthetic graft infection rates exceeded those rates of autologous access procedures, we recommend the vigorous use of autologous AVFs in all patients who are HIV+, regardless of CD4+ count.",

    "abstract": "Arterial aneurysms have only recently been associated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The clinical and pathological features of 10 HIV-positive patients with arterial aneurysms were retrospectively evaluated. These aneurysms were unusual in that they affected young black patients, occurred in atypical sites, and tended toward multiplicity. Surgery was performed in eight patients. Acute and chronic inflammatory changes were revealed by means of histologic examination of the aneurysm walls, with occlusion of the vasa vasora by inflammatory infiltrate or edema being a prominent feature. Culture of the aneurysm wall or thrombus yielded positive results in two patients. The association between HIV and aneurysms may be coincidental, caused by direct viral action or by bacterial infection resulting from immunosuppression. Implications for therapy are discussed, and the need for further study is highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who are hospitalized. An important part of the mechanism of DVT prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) is reduced venous stasis with increased velocity of venous return. The conventional methods of IPC use low pressure and slow inflation of the air bladder on the leg to augment venous return. Recently, compression devices have been designed that produce high pressure and rapid inflation of air cuffs on the plantar plexus of the foot and the calf. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the venous velocity response to high-pressure, rapid-inflation compression devices versus standard, low-pressure, slow-inflation compression devices in healthy volunteers and patients with severe post-thrombotic venous disease.\nTwenty-two lower extremities from healthy volunteers and 11 lower extremities from patients with class 4 to class 6 post-thrombotic chronic venous insufficiency were studied. With duplex ultrasound scanning (ATL-Ultramark 9, Advanced Tech Laboratory, Bothell, Wash), acute DVT was excluded before subject evaluation. Venous velocities were monitored after the application of each of five IPC devices, with all the patients in the supine position. Three high-pressure, rapid-compression devices and two standard, low-pressure, slow-inflation compression devices were applied in a random sequence. Maximal venous velocities were obtained at the common femoral vein and the popliteal vein for all the devices and were recorded as the mean peak velocity of three compression cycles and compared with baseline velocities.\nThe baseline venous velocities were higher in the femoral veins than in the popliteal veins in both the volunteers and the post-thrombotic subjects. Standard and high-pressure, rapid-inflation compression significantly increased the popliteal and femoral vein velocities in healthy and post-thrombotic subjects. High-pressure, rapid-inflation compression produced significantly higher maximal venous velocities in the popliteal and femoral veins in both healthy volunteers and patients who were post-thrombotic as compared with standard compression. Compared with the healthy volunteers, the patients who were post-thrombotic had a significantly attenuated velocity response at both the popliteal and the femoral vein levels.\nHigh-pressure, rapid-inflation pneumatic compression increases popliteal and femoral vein velocity as compared with standard, low-pressure, slow-inflation pneumatic compression. Patients with post-thrombotic venous disease have a compromised hemodynamic response to all IPC devices. However, an increased velocity response to the high-pressure, rapid-inflation compression device is preserved. High-pressure, rapid-inflation pneumatic compression may offer additional protection from thrombotic complications on the basis of an improved hemodynamic response, both in healthy volunteers and in patients who were post-thrombotic.",

    "abstract": "We previously described an original transcervical approach to resect primary or secondary malignant diseases that invade the thoracic inlet (TI). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the technical aspects and long-term results of the resection and revascularization of the subclavian artery (SA).\nBetween 1986 and 1998, 34 patients (mean age, 49 years) underwent en bloc resection of TI cancer that had invaded the SA. The surgical approach was an L-shaped transclavicular cervicotomy in 33 patients. In 14 of these patients, this approach was associated with a posterolateral thoracotomy (n = 10) or a posterior midline approach (n = 4). In one patient, the procedure was achieved with a single posterolateral thoracotomy approach. An end-to-end anastomosis was performed in 16 patients. In one patient, a subclavian-left common carotid artery transposition was performed. In one other patient, an end-to-end anastomosis was performed between the proximal innominate artery and the SA. The right carotid artery was transposed into the SA in an end-to-side fashion. In 16 patients, prosthetic revascularization with a polytetrafluoroethylene graft was performed. Thirty-three patients underwent postoperative radiation therapy.\nThere were no cases of perioperative death, neurologic sequelae, graft infections or occlusions, or limb ischemia. There were two delayed asymptomatic polytetrafluoroethylene graft occlusions at 12 and 31 months. The 5-year patency rate was 85%. During this study, 20 patients died: 18 died of tumor recurrence (5 local and systemic and 13 systemic), one of respiratory failure, and one of an unknown cause at 74 months. The overall 5-year survival rate was 36%, and the 5-year disease-free survival rate was 18%.\nTumor arterial invasion per se should not be a contraindication to TI cancer resection. This study shows that cancers that invade the SA can be resected through an L-shaped transclavicular cervicotomy, with good results with a concomitant revascularization of the SA.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare quality of life in patients with and without various ischemic complications after infrainguinal bypass grafting surgery for occlusive vascular disease.\nA sample of patients (n = 746) randomized in the Dutch BOA study (n = 2645), a multicenter trial that compared the effectiveness of oral anticoagulant therapy with aspirin in the prevention of infrainguinal bypass graft occlusions, was entered in this study. On the basis of clinical outcomes of the trial, the patients were grouped as follows: patients with patent grafts (n = 409); patients with nontreated graft occlusions, subdivided into an asymptomatic group (n = 32) and a symptomatic group (n = 65); patients with subsequent revascularizations (n = 194); patients with amputations (n = 36); and patients with failed secondary revascularizations followed by secondary amputation (n = 38). In case an outcome event occurred, the patients were regrouped accordingly. Every half year, the patients completed a Short Form-36 and a EuroQol questionnaire. A multilevel model was used for repeated measure analysis.\nThe mean follow-up time was 21 months. The quality of life in patients with nontreated asymptomatic occlusions was roughly similar to the quality of life in patients with patent grafts. Patients with symptomatic nontreated occlusions had the lowest outcome with regard to pain as compared with the other groups. Furthermore, physical and social functioning was lower for these patients than for patients with patent grafts. Revascularizations, successful or not, negatively affected pain, social functioning, and physical and emotional role. After successful revascularization, some improvement was observed in pain, physical and social functioning, and general and mental health as compared with the group with nontreated symptomatic occlusions. Amputation deteriorated physical functioning strikingly, especially after failed secondary revascularization. These patients also had the lowest scores of all the groups in the dimensions of social functioning, physical and emotional role, and mental health. EuroQol score showed deterioration of quality of life after all events, except for asymptomatic occlusions. The same patterns emerged if we stratified our analysis according to the indication for the initial operation: claudication or limb salvage. Quality of life was constant over time in all the groups in the observed period.\nQuality of life in patients with asymptomatic occluded grafts is similar to quality of life in patients with patent grafts. Revascularization of symptomatic occluded grafts improves quality of life to a certain extent. Amputation, in particular after failed secondary revascularization, seemed to be the lowest possible outcome. The results of the Short Form-36 and EuroQol measurements were in line with the clinical expectations. The association of disease severity with scores on the instruments supports the construct validity of these outcome measures for an objective assessment of quality of life in controlled studies.",

An extent I thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm subsequently developed and was successfully repaired. Aggressive evaluation of new back pain after such a procedure is warranted.

    "abstract": "Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) is a segmental inflammatory vasculitis that involves the small-sized and medium-sized arteries, veins, and nerves. It is causally related to tobacco use. The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of the presence of distal arterial disease in individuals who smoke and in whom other disease entities have been excluded. The most effective treatment for Buerger's disease is smoking cessation. Without strict adherence to tobacco avoidance, disease progression is likely. Methods to control ischemic pain include medications, sympathectomy, or surgical revascularization. The effect of sympathectomy is unpredictable, and the chances of a successful revascularization procedure are rare because distal target vessels often are extensively diseased. Herein, we describe a patient whose condition did not respond to the usual conservative therapy but did respond dramatically to the implantation of a permanent spinal cord stimulator. Although these devices have been used for more than 20 years in various other peripheral arterial diseases, their use in Buerger's disease has been limited.",

    "abstract": "To determine anatomicomorphological changes in the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta, we performed 645 dissections of the segment in corpses undergoing necropsy.\nThe aortas were removed from the corpses with a surgical technique; by means of a device that we designed, the external diameter of the artery was measured after luminal pressure was reestablished. This way, it was possible to avoid underestimation of the arterial diameter postmortem. The influence of age, sex, body size, arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and coronary disease on the aortic diameter and the influence of different degrees of sclerosis on the infrarenal aorta wall were analyzed. Considering the diameters, aortas were regarded as \"normal\" when they did not present any ectasia, arteriomegaly, aneurysm, or hypoplasia.\nThe sample involved 645 subjects whose ages ranged from 19 to 97 years (mean age, 55.8 years). Of the 645 subjects, 65.5% (423) were men, 34.5% (222) were women, 81% (523) were white, and 19% (122) were of another race. The diameters of arteries showing no anomalous dilatation (ectasis, arteriomegaly, or aneurysm) varied according to subject age, sex, body length, and the degree of atherosclerosis on the aorta wall (P <.01). Aortic diameters of those subjects with arterial hypertension, coronary disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were compared with the aortic diameters of control subjects, and significant differences were not shown (P >.05). Twenty-nine aneurysms were found (4.5% prevalence). Four were ruptured aneurysms, and all occurred in aortas with diameters larger than 5.0 cm.\nThe infrarenal aortic diameter enlarges with aging, and this enlargement occurs earlier in men than in women. Those subjects who had a longer body length and advanced sclerosis on the aorta wall had larger aortic diameters. There was a high prevalence of infrarenal aneurysms (4.5%), with rupture found solely in aortas with diameters larger than 5.0 cm.",

To determine the current results of the standard operative treatment of these patterns of pararenal aortic aneurysms, we reviewed the outcome of 257 consecutive patients who underwent operation for JR-AAAs (n = 122), SR-AAAs (n = 58), or RAOD (n = 77).\nThe patients with SR-AAAs and RAOD were younger (67.5 +/- 8.8 years) than were the patients with JR-AAAs (70.5 +/- 8.3 years), and more patients with RAOD were women (43% vs 21% for JR-AAAs and SR-AAAs). The patient groups were similar in the frequency of coronary artery and pulmonary disease and in most risk factors for atherosclerosis, except hypertension, which was more common in the RAOD group. Significantly more patients with RAOD had reduced renal function before surgery (51% vs 23%). Supravisceral aortic crossclamping (above the superior mesenteric artery or the celiac artery) was needed more often in patients with SR-AAAs (52% vs 39% for RAOD and 17% for JR-AAAs). Seventeen patients (7%) had undergone a prior aortic reconstruction. The most common renal reconstruction for SR-AAA was reimplantation (n = 37; 64%) or bypass grafting (n = 12; 21%) and for RAOD was transaortic renal endarterectomy (n = 71; 92%). Mean AAA diameter was 6.7 +/- 2.1 cm and was larger in the JR-AAA (7.1 +/- 2.1 cm) and SR-AAA (6.9 +/- 2.1 cm) groups as compared with the RAOD group (5.9 +/- 1.7 cm).\nThe overall mortality rate was 5.8% (n = 15) and was the same for all the groups. The mortality rate correlated (P <.05) with hematologic complications (bleeding) and postoperative visceral ischemia or infarction but not with aneurysm group or cardiac, pulmonary, or renal complications. Renal ischemia duration averaged 31.6 +/- 21.6 minutes and was longer in the SR-AAA group (43.6 +/- 38.9 minutes). Some postoperative renal function loss occurred in 104 patients (40.5%), of whom 18 (7.0%) required dialysis. At discharge or death, 24 patients (9.3%) still had no improvement in renal function and 11 of those patients (4.3%) remained on dialysis. Postoperative loss of renal function correlated (P <.05) with preoperative abnormal renal function and duration of renal ischemia but not with aneurysm type, crossclamp level, or type of renal reconstruction.\nThese results showed that pararenal AAA repair can be performed safely and effectively. The outcomes for all three aneurysm types were similar, but there was an increased risk of loss of renal function when preoperative renal function was abnormal. These data provide a benchmark for expected treatment outcomes in patients with these patterns of pararenal aortic aneurysmal disease that currently can only be managed with open repair.",

    "abstract": "The outcome of crossover axilloaxillary bypass grafting in patients with stenosis or occlusion of the innominate or subclavian arteries was investigated.\nThe study was designed as a retrospective clinical study in a university hospital setting with 61 patients as the basis of the study. Fifty-eight patients (95.1%) had at least two risk factors or associated medical illnesses for atherosclerosis, and 35 patients (57.4%) had concomitant carotid artery stenosis that necessitated a staged procedure in 12 patients (19.7%). The patients underwent a total of 63 crossover axilloaxillary bypass grafting procedures. Demographics, risk factors and associated medical illnesses, preoperative symptoms and angiographic data, blood flow inversion in the vertebral artery, concomitant carotid artery disease, graft shape, caliber and material, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were studied to assess the specific influence in determining the outcome.\nOne postoperative death (1.6%), four early graft thromboses (6.2%), and six minor complications (9. 8%) occurred. The overall mortality and morbidity rates were 1.6% and 16.1%, respectively. During the follow-up period (mean, 97.3 +/- 7.9 months), we observed five graft thromboses (8.3%). Primary and secondary patency rates at 5 and 10 years were 86.5% and 82.8% and 88.1% and 84.3%, respectively. Overall, two patients (3.3%) had recurrence of upper limb symptoms and none had recurrence of symptoms in the carotid or vertebrobasilar territory. The 5-year and 10-year symptom-free interval rates were 97.7% and 93.5%, respectively. Nine patients (15%) died of unrelated causes. The 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 93.2% and 67.3%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that no specific variables exerted an influence in the short-term and long-term results and the outcome.\nThe optimal outcome of axilloaxillary bypass grafting supports its use as the most valuable surgical alternative to transthoracic anatomic reconstructions for innominate lesion, long stenosis of the subclavian artery, and short subclavian artery stenosis associated with ispilateral carotid artery lesions.",

    "abstract": "Cyclooxygenase, either the cox1 or cox2 isoform, controls synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which regulates expression of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9). PGE2 and MMP-9 are elevated in aortic aneurysms. The mechanisms and time course of the inhibition of aneurysm expansion with a nonspecific cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, were determined in an animal model.\nRats underwent aortic perfusion with saline (n = 40) as controls or with elastase. Elastase-treated animals received no treatment (n = 82) or received indomethacin (n = 73). Aortic diameters were determined at the time of aortic perfusion and when the rats were killed. The aortas were harvested and used for whole organ culture, substrate gel zymography, or histologic analysis.\nThe control group demonstrated little change in aortic diameter. All the elastase-only animals developed aneurysms (maximal aortic diameter, 5.27 +/- 2.37 mm on day 14). Indomethacin markedly decreased the rate of aortic expansion (maximum aortic diameter, 3.45 +/- 1.11 mm; P <.001 vs the elastase-only group). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of aortic explant culture media showed that PGE2 synthesis paralleled aortic expansion, and indomethacin decreased PGE2 synthesis. Histologically, the aortic elastin architecture was destroyed in the elastase group, but was preserved with indomethacin treatment. In situ, hybridization for cox1 and cox2 showed that cox2, but not cox1, was expressed and was co-localized by immunohistochemistry to macrophages associated with the aortic wall. Decreased levels of MMP-9 activity with indomethacin were shown by means of substrate zymography. MMP-9 was also localized to macrophages.\nIndomethacin attenuates aneurysm growth, and its effects are mediated via inhibition of the cox2 isoform of cyclooxygenase, which decreases PGE2 and MMP-9 synthesis.",

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that induced overexpression of a cytostatic nonphosphorylatable form of the retinoblastoma protein (DeltaRb) would attenuate neointimal thickening in experimental vein grafts.\nA replication-deficient adenovirus vector that encoded a nonphosphorylatable, constitutively active form of DeltaRb was constructed (AdDeltaRb) and contained an NH2-terminal epitope tag from the influenza hemagglutinin molecule (HA). Forty-eight male New Zealand white rabbits underwent surgical exposure of the external jugular vein for transfection with either 3 x 10(10) plaque-forming units/mL AdDeltaRb (n = 16), 3 x 10(10) plaque-forming units/mL control adenovirus (AdBglII, n = 15), or vehicle (n = 17) for 10 minutes at 120 mm Hg. After vector exposure, the vein was excised and interposed end-to-end into the carotid circulation. After 5 days, 12 grafts (four from each group) were excised and assayed for genomic DeltaRb DNA with the polymerase chain reaction or for hemagglutinin molecule expression and localization with immunohistochemistry. The remainder of the grafts (n = 36) were perfusion-fixed after 4 weeks, and 5 microm sections prepared for digital planimetric analysis.\nPolymerase chain reaction results identified the DeltaRb gene only in the grafts that were transfected with AdDeltaRb. Immunohistochemical analysis results revealed transgene expression in most of the endothelial cells and in many of the smooth muscle cells. After 4 weeks, the grafts that were exposed to AdDeltaRb exhibited a 22% reduction in neointimal thickness (vehicle, 77 +/- 7 microm; AdBglII, 75 +/- 5 microm; AdDeltaRb, 60 +/- 5 microm; P =.05), and medial thickness, luminal diameter, and other parameters were unchanged (medial thickness: vehicle, 72 +/- 10 microm; AdBglII, 85 +/- 7 microm; AdDeltaRb, 69 +/- 9 microm; P = NS; luminal diameter: vehicle, 4.5 +/- 0.2 mm; AdBglII, 4.4 +/- 0.2 mm; AdDeltaRb, 4.7 +/- 0.1 mm; P = NS).\nWith this delivery system, adenoviral-mediated gene transfer is highly efficient and induced overexpression of DeltaRb leads to a reduction in vein graft neointimal thickening.",

The target tissues included endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and human saphenous veins (HSVs). Polyurethane stent grafts were suffused with lac Z-transduced ECs and SMCs that were harvested from porcine jugular vein. The grafts were implanted into the iliac artery of each pig whose jugular vein had been harvested. Cell retention was analyzed at 1 and 4 weeks with X-Gal staining.\nVSVG-MuLV transduction efficiency exceeded that of ampho-MuLV in human ECs (VSVG-MuLV, n = 24, 89% +/- 6%; ampho-MuLV, n = 18, 14% +/- 6%; P <. 001), human SMCs (VSVG-MuLV, n = 5, 92% +/- 3%; ampho-MuLV, n = 4, 17% +/- 2%; P <.001), pig ECs (VSVG-MuLV, n = 4, 81% +/- 2%; ampho-MuLV, n = 4, 13% +/- 3%; P <.001), and pig SMCs (VSVG-MuLV, n = 5, 89% +/- 3%; ampho-MuLV, n = 4, 16% +/- 1%; P <.001). As much as a 10-fold higher transduction efficiency was observed with VSVG-MuLV in HSVs. After the stent graft implantation, the engineered cells were retained and proliferated on the stent membrane, with ingrowth into the underlying intima.\nVSVG-MuLV significantly increased the gene transfer efficiency in vascular SMCs and ECs and in organ-cultured HSVs.

    "abstract": "Fibrin glue (FG) has been used as a delivery system for bioactive agents on grafts and angioplasty sites. Reports from two different institutions suggest that heparin concentrations of 500 U/mL in FG inhibit smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, but do not effect endothelial cell (EC) proliferation. The purposes of this study were to (1) quantify the diffusive release of fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) and heparin from FG; (2) determine the effect of heparin and FGF-1 on SMC proliferation when the cells are immediately plated on the FG; and (3) by means of the diffusive release data, design a new in vitro model that may differentiate the effect of FG-incorporated FGF-1 and heparin, rather than the released, solubilized components of these two factors, on SMC and EC proliferation.\n125I-FGF-1 or 3H-heparin release from FG into the overlying media was measured serially in a 96-hour period, either with or without cells. SMCs were immediately plated on FG containing various concentrations of FGF-1 and heparin. SMCs or ECs were plated on identical groups of FG containing FGF-1 and heparin 24 hours after the FG was made to exclude the effect on cell growth of the initial release of FGF-1 into the media.\nIn the first 24 hours, 70% +/- 1% of the FGF-1 and 59% +/- 2% of the heparin in the FG was released into the overlying media, with minimal release occurring thereafter. The cell type or absence of cells did not affect release, but there was five times more FGF-1 and four times more heparin in the media at 72 hours for the immediate plating versus the delayed plating because of a diffusive release primarily in the first 24 hours. A heparin concentration of 500 U/mL inhibited SMC proliferation, as compared with 5 U/mL heparin, only when immediate plating of SMCs was used. Comparing immediate versus delayed SMC plating, at equivalent FGF-1 and heparin doses, immediate plating induced greater proliferation than delayed plating; this was likely caused by the higher soluble FGF-1 concentration. Heparin doses as high as 500 U/mL had little effect on SMC proliferation. In contrast, ECs died with delayed plating on FG containing 500 U/mL heparin, and their growth was inhibited at 50 U/mL heparin, as compared with 5 U/mL heparin.\nThe differences in SMC proliferation when comparing immediate versus delayed plating are likely caused by diffusive release of heparin and FGF-1 into the media. Our ongoing work uses an optimized in vitro FG system that minimizes the effects of soluble factors. This is an important distinction, because the cytokines that are released in vivo will be removed by blood flow and, thus, may not exert an effect unless they are contained within the FG.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies on graft healing have shown increased platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) production in graft segments versus native aortic segments. The purpose of this study was to characterize the proliferative response of graft smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to PDGF.\nThoracoabdominal grafts were implanted in beagles. SMCs were harvested from the graft and the proximal and distal aortas. Basal proliferation was assessed with growth curves in primary culture. The proliferative response to PDGF then was compared with [3H]thymidine uptake studies and cell counts. Finally, PDGF receptors were characterized with radio-labeled ligand binding assays.\nThe growth curves showed that the graft SMCs entered log-phase growth 2 days earlier than did the aortic SMCs. Stimulation of quiescent early-passage graft SMCs with PDGF (10 ng/mL) resulted in a 1.7 +/- 0.1-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation, which was significantly less than that of the SMCs from both the proximal aorta (11.8 +/- 3.0) and the distal aorta (10. 2 +/- 1.9; P <.5). Similarly, the 1.1 +/- 0.1-fold increase in graft SMC cell number was significantly less than the increases for both proximal (2.8 +/- 0.5) and distal (2.9 +/- 0.8) aortic SMCs (P <.5). Binding studies on quiescent first-passage cells showed fewer PDGF receptors available for binding in the graft SMCs (185 +/- 70 fmol/million cells) as compared with both the proximal (419 +/- 147 fmol/million cells) and the distal (387 +/- 112 fmol/million cells) aortas (P <.5). Binding affinity was similar for the three groups.\nGraft SMCs exist in a chronic proliferative state but exhibit a decreased proliferative response to PDGF and have fewer receptors available for binding PDGF than do aortic SMCs in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Management decisions regarding carotid artery disease are critically dependent on stenosis but have been made difficult because of conflicting methods used to determine such stenosis. The increasing use of duplex ultrasound scanning has conventionally depended on Doppler velocity measurement, an indirect method for calculating carotid stenosis. Recent technical advances have improved the quality of B-mode/color-flow ultrasound scan imaging (USI). We tested prospectively whether USI was clinically effective as the primary criterion for estimating carotid stenosis.\nTransverse and longitudinal USI, Doppler velocity, and arteriography data were obtained sequentially and independently for 713 carotid bifurcations. The internal carotid artery (ICA) residual lumen, the local outer diameter at the stenotic site, and the diameter distal to the bulb were measured in a representative USI longitudinal section. The peak systolic velocity and the end diastolic velocity (EDV) were measured at the stenosis. Local stenosis as determined with USI was compared with the x-ray arteriographic clinical radiology interpretation (XRI). As the primary method, radiologists compared the residual lumen with the distal ICA diameter, as recommended by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study. Analysis was by means of the USI positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the XRI findings, with the assumption that 80%, 70%, and 60% local stenosis with USI related to 70%, 60%, and 50% stenosis with XRI, respectively.\nAll 56 ICA occlusions as determined with USI were confirmed with XRI. When the USI showed 80% to 99% stenosis, the PPV of the XRI showing 70% to 99% stenosis was 94% (116/123). Two ICAs that were shown to be severely diseased with USI appeared to be occluded with XRI. For <50% stenosis shown with USI, the prediction of <50% stenosis shown with XRI was 94% (253/269). For borderline stenosis in the 50% to 79% range with USI, the addition of velocity criteria to USI data improved both the PPV and the NPV. In the range of 70% to 79% stenosis with USI, the PPV improved from 82% (76/93) to 91% (53/58) for the subgroup with an EDV of more than 80 cm/s. For the range of 60% to 69% stenosis with USI, the PPV improved from 75% (71/95) to 95% (21/22) for the subgroup with an EDV of more than 80 cm/s. In the range of 50% to 59% stenosis with USI, the NPV improved from 69% (53/77) to 93% (14/15) for the subset with a peak systolic velocity of less than 100 cm/s.\nOn the basis of the USI data alone, a prediction of arteriographic findings was possible at the 95% level for occlusion and severe stenosis and for ruling out hemodynamically significant stenosis. The addition of velocity data improved prediction in borderline degrees of stenosis. USI was effective for quantifying clinically significant degrees of stenosis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of the elective surgical treatment of symptomatic chronic mesenteric occlusive disease (SCMOD) and to identify the factors that influence the results of this procedure.\nFrom 1977 to 1997, 85 patients (mean age, 62 years) underwent elective surgical treatment of SCMOD. The presenting symptoms were abdominal pain in 78 patients (92%) and weight loss in 74 patients (87%). The surgical procedures included retrograde bypass grafting in 34 patients (40%), antegrade bypass grafting in 24 patients (28%), transaortic endarterectomy in 19 patients (22%), local arterial endarterectomy with patch angioplasty in six patients (7%), thrombectomy alone in one patient (1%), and superior mesenteric artery reimplantation in one patient (1%). Thirty-five patients (41%) underwent concomitant aortic replacement. All the involved mesenteric vessels were revascularized in 21 patients (25%), whereas revascularization was incomplete for the remaining 64 patients (75%). Late information was available for all 85 patients at a mean interval of 4.8 years.\nThere were seven early (<35 days) postoperative deaths (8%). The cumulative 5-year survival rate was 64% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53% to 75%), and the 3-year symptom-free survival rate was 81% (95% CI, 72% to 90%). Serious complications occurred in 28 patients (33%). The results of univariate analysis identified advancing age at operation (P <.001), cardiac disease (P =.03), hypertension (P =.03), and additional occlusive disease (P =.05) as variables associated with mortality. Concomitant aortic replacement (P =.037), renal disease (P =.011), advancing age ( P =.035), and complete revascularization ( P =.032) were associated with postoperative morbidity including mortality. Late recurrent mesenteric occlusive disease was seen in 21 patients (16 symptomatic and five asymptomatic). Nine patients (43%) died, and 8 patients (38%) required subsequent surgical or endovascular procedures to treat their recurrent lesions. The 3-year survival rate from recurrent mesenteric occlusive disease was 76% (95% CI, 66% to 86%).\nWe conclude that the elective surgical treatment of SCMOD may be performed with reasonable early and late mortality rates and that most of the patients remain free from recurrent symptoms of mesenteric ischemia. Advancing age, cardiac disease, hypertension, and additional occlusive disease significantly influenced the overall mortality rates, and concomitant aortic replacement, renal disease, and complete revascularization were significantly associated with postoperative morbidity rates. Surveillance and appropriate correction of recurrent disease appear to be necessary for optimal long-term results.",

    "abstract": "Lower-extremity arterial anatomy that is insufficient for successful vein bypass grafting and major proximal foot wounds often lead to leg amputation in patients with severe ischemia. Free tissue transfer, which can provide limb salvage in these patients after arterial reconstruction, was studied.\nDuring a 45-month period, 21 patients who otherwise would have undergone leg amputation were treated with arterial bypass by means of vein grafting and free tissue transfer. Ages of the patients ranged from 40 to 73 years (average, 59 years); 18 of the 21 patients had diabetes mellitus; and all patients except one were men. Arterial reconstruction was performed from the femoral (nine of 21 patients) or popliteal artery (12 of 21 patients) to the posterior tibial (eight patients), dorsalis pedis (five patients), peroneal (three patients), popliteal (one patient), or anterior tibial artery (one patient), or directly to the free flap (three patients). The tissue transferred included latissimus dorsi (five patients), rectus abdominus (five patients), omentum (five patients), gracilis (two patients), radial forearm flaps (three patients), and a scapular flap (one patient). Foot defects were debrided, including the appropriate toe or transmetatarsal amputation, covered with the transferred flap, and then split-thickness skin grafted. Arterial flow for all flaps was through the vein grafts, with direct arterial anastomosis and with venous outflow through adjacent tibial veins.\nAll 21 procedures were successful initially, without operative mortality, but three failed within 4 weeks because of uncontrolled infection (two) or embolization from a remote site (one) and required below-knee amputation. Grafts remained patent in 18 procedures, and follow-up of this cohort ranged from 1 to 45 months (mean, 13.3 months). Two patients died, one after 4 months and one after 6 months, of unrelated illness; at the time of death, they had functioning grafts. The remaining 19 patients are alive. Of these, 15 have patent arterial grafts, all viable free flaps. Thus, limb salvage was accomplished in 18 of 21 (86%) patients who otherwise would have required below-knee amputation.\nPatients destined for leg amputation despite aggressive traditional arterial bypass grafting methods can achieve limb salvage with the additional technique of free tissue transfer.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of gender on the immediate and long-term postoperative morbidity, mortality, and patency rates for infrainguinal autogenous vein bypass grafts.\nData were abstracted for consecutive patients who were followed in a prospective surveillance protocol after undergoing infrainguinal autogenous vein bypass grafting during the years 1988 to 1994. There were 165 grafts constructed in 148 patients (101 in 87 men, and 64 in 61 women). Gender differences were analyzed with Student t test or chi2 test for risk factors, indications for reconstruction, and complications. The patency rates and the long-term survival rates were compared by means of life-table analysis. Eagle criteria and long-term survival rates were compared with multivariate analysis.\nThe mean follow-up period was 36 months (39 months for men, and 32 months for women), with a range of 6 to 123 months for the total follow-up period. The two groups did not differ in age at the time of operation (66.6 +/- 1.2 years for men, and 66.7 +/- 1.5 years for women) or in history of diabetes (48% for men, and 56% for women). The risks were similar for hypertension (48% for men vs 45% women), preoperative myocardial infarction (23% for men vs 26% for women), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (9% for men vs 8% for women). The thallium stress scintigraphy results showed a diagnosis of proportionately more preoperative defects in men (reversible, 34% vs 18%, P <.05; overall, 75% vs 43%, P <.05). The 30-day limb loss rates (0.9% for men, and 0% for women) and mortality rates (2.2% for men, and 5% for women) were similar. Women had statistically more perioperative myocardial infarctions than did men (6 of 61, 9.8% vs 2 of 101, 2%; P <.05), as was documented with electrocardiography and cardiac isoenzymes. Two of these women died within a 30-day postoperative period. The 3-year primary patency rate was 85% for the men and 88% for the women, and the primary assisted patency rate was 97% for the men and 97% for the women. The secondary patency rate was 98% for the men and 97% for the women. The limb salvage rate was slightly higher for the men than for the women (93% vs 87%), although this was not statistically significant. The 5-year survival rate for women was statistically less than for men, with life-table analysis (58% for men vs 42% for women; P <.05).\nAfter distal bypass grafting, men and women have similar rates of patency and limb salvage, but women have a higher incidence rate of perioperative myocardial infarction and a decreased 5-year survival rate. These data suggest that women have unrecognized cardiac disease that affects them adversely in the perioperative period and the long term when compared with men who undergo the same operation.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have recommended unilateral venous duplex scanning for the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients who are unilaterally symptomatic. Vascular laboratory accreditation standards, however, imply that bilateral leg scanning should be performed. We examined whether actual practice patterns have evolved toward limited unilateral scanning in such patients.\nA questionnaire was mailed to all 808 vascular laboratories in the United States that were accredited by the Intersocietal Commission for the Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories (ICAVL). To encourage candid responses, the questionnaires were numerically coded and confidentiality was assured.\nA total of 608 questionnaires (75%) were completed and returned. Most of the respondents (442; 73%) were either community-hospital or office-based laboratories, and the remaining 163 (27%) were university or affiliated-hospital laboratories. Most of the laboratories (460; 76%) had been in existence for 9 years or more, and 65% had been ICAVL-accredited in venous studies for 3 years or more. Board-certified vascular surgeons were the medical directors in 54% of the laboratories. Duplex ultrasound scanning was the diagnostic method used by 98% of the laboratories. In patients with unilateral symptoms, 75% of the laboratories did not routinely scan both legs for DVT. A large majority (75%) believe that bilateral scanning is not clinically indicated. Only 57 laboratories (14%) recalled having patients return with a DVT in the previously unscanned leg, with 93% of these laboratories reporting between one and five such patients. This observation correlated with larger volumes of venous studies performed by those laboratories (P <.05). Similarly, only 52 laboratories (12%) recalled having patients return with subsequent pulmonary emboli. Of these laboratories, only five reported proximal DVT in the previously unscanned legs of such patients. Of all these laboratories, therefore, only 1% (5 of 443) have potentially missed the diagnosis of a DVT that caused a preventable pulmonary embolus with such a policy. Among those laboratories that always perform bilateral examinations, 41% do so because of habit. Most (61%) of the laboratories that perform bilateral scanning would do unilateral scanning if it were specifically approved by ICAVL.\nThree quarters of the ICAVL-accredited vascular laboratories perform limited single-extremity scanning for the diagnosis of DVT in patients with unilateral symptoms. This broad clinical experience suggests that this practice is widespread in selected patients. Clinical protocols should be established to provide guidelines for local laboratory implementation.",

    "abstract": "Local anesthesia has been shown to reduce cardiopulmonary mortality and morbidity rates in patients who undergo selected peripheral vascular procedures. The efforts to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) with endovascular techniques have largely been driven by the desire to reduce the mortality and morbidity rates as compared with those associated with open aneurysm repair. Early results have indicated a modest degree of success in this goal. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of endovascular repair of AAAs with local anesthesia.\nDuring a 14-month period, 47 patients underwent endovascular repair of infrarenal AAAs with local anesthesia that was supplemented with intravenous sedation. Anesthetic monitoring was selective on the basis of comorbidities. The patient ages ranged from 48 to 93 years (average age, 74.4 +/- 9.8 years). Of the 47 patients, 55% had significant coronary artery disease, 30% had significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 13% had diabetes. The average anesthesia grade was 3.1, with 30% of the patients having an average anesthesia grade of 4. The mean aortic aneurysm diameter was 5.77 cm (range, 4.5 to 12.0 cm). All the implanted grafts were bifurcated in design.\nEndovascular repair of the infrarenal AAA was successful for all 47 patients. One patient required the conversion to general anesthesia to facilitate the repair of an injured external iliac artery via a retroperitoneal approach. The operative mortality rate was 0. No patient had a myocardial infarction or had other cardiopulmonary complications develop in the perioperative period. The average operative time was 170 minutes, and the average blood loss was 623 mL (range, 100 to 2500 mL). The fluid requirements averaged 2491 mL. Of the 47 patients, 46 (98%) tolerated oral intake and were ambulatory within 24 hours of graft implantation. The patients were discharged from the hospital an average of 2.13 days after the procedure, with 87% of the patients discharged less than 48 hours after the graft implantation. Furthermore, at least 30% of the patients could have been discharged on the first postoperative day except for study protocol requirements for computed tomographic scanning at 48 hours.\nThis is the first reported series that describes the use of local anesthesia for the endovascular repair of infrarenal AAAs. Our preliminary results indicate that the endovascular treatment of AAAs with local anesthesia is feasible and can be performed safely in a patient population with significant comorbidities. The significant potential advantages include decreased cardiopulmonary morbidity rates, shorter hospital stays, and lower hospital costs. A definitive evaluation of the benefits of local anesthesia will necessitate a direct comparison with other anesthetic techniques.",

Our preliminary results indicate that the endovascular treatment of AAAs with local anesthesia is feasible and can be performed safely in a patient population with significant comorbidities. The significant potential advantages include decreased cardiopulmonary morbidity rates, shorter hospital stays, and lower hospital costs. A definitive evaluation of the benefits of local anesthesia will necessitate a direct comparison with other anesthetic techniques.",

No patient had a myocardial infarction or had other cardiopulmonary complications develop in the perioperative period. The average operative time was 170 minutes, and the average blood loss was 623 mL (range, 100 to 2500 mL). The fluid requirements averaged 2491 mL. Of the 47 patients, 46 (98%) tolerated oral intake and were ambulatory within 24 hours of graft implantation. The patients were discharged from the hospital an average of 2.13 days after the procedure, with 87% of the patients discharged less than 48 hours after the graft implantation. Furthermore, at least 30% of the patients could have been discharged on the first postoperative day except for study protocol requirements for computed tomographic scanning at 48 hours.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports on an experience with a clinical pathway for elective infrarenal aortic surgery (AS) that targeted hospital discharge on postoperative day (POD) 3. The pathway incorporated early feeding, early ambulation, and selective use of the intensive care unit (ICU).\nA review of 50 consecutive hospital discharges after AS (aneurysm repair and aortofemoral bypass grafting) by a single surgeon performed from April 1996 through June 1998 with this clinical pathway is reported. The data collected included morbidity rate, mortality rate, length of stay (LOS), and number of hospital readmissions.\nThe average LOS for all patients was 3.0 days. Only six patients (12%) were admitted to the ICU. Discharge on POD 3 was achieved in 80% of the group (40 of 50), and increasing experience improved compliance, with 92% of the most recent 25 patients (23 of 25) being discharged by POD 3. Eleven of these 25 patients (44%) were discharged on POD 2. No patient was readmitted to the hospital within a 30-day period after discharge. There was no mortality after AS during this period.\nFactors that limit the discharge of patients recovering from AS include the ability to ambulate independently and to tolerate a diet. Ambulation and feeding on POD 1 were well tolerated by most patients, which shortened the period of hospitalization. Admission to the ICU was infrequently required when a monitored surgical step-down unit was available. Discharge by POD 3 for AS has been proven to be routinely achievable, safe, and well accepted by patients and to reduce the cost of hospitalization.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to determine the incidence rate of heparin-associated antiplatelet antibodies (HAAb) in patients who require major vascular reconstruction and to determine whether the HAAb were associated with perioperative thrombotic events.\nOne hundred six patients who underwent elective arterial reconstruction for cerebrovascular occlusive disease (n = 48), aortoiliac occlusive disease (n = 13), aortoiliac aneurysm (n = 17), mesenteric arterial occlusive disease (n = 1), or infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease (n = 28) prospectively underwent evaluation from July 1, 1996, to June 30, 1997. Heparin-associated antibody tests (with a two-point platelet aggregation assay) and platelet counts (via Coulter counter) were performed before surgery and on or after the 4th day after vascular reconstruction. Arterial reconstruction thromboses were established by means of duplex ultrasound scanning or angiography. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and venous thromboses were diagnosed with clinical criteria and duplex ultrasound scanning, respectively. A significant decrease in platelet count was defined as a platelet count of less than 100, 000/mm3 or as a more than 30% drop in the platelet count.\nTwenty-two patients (21%) had at least one positive HAAb assay: one assay was positive before surgery only (after angiography), six were positive both before and after surgery, and 15 were positive after surgery only. There were three perioperative deaths-one in the HAAb-positive group and two in the HAAb-negative group. Ten thrombotic events occurred in the perioperative period. Four thrombotic events (three operative site thromboses and one AMI) occurred in the HAAb-positive group (18.2%). All of these patients were undergoing heparin therapy. Of the six patients (with three operative site thromboses, two deep venous thromboses, and one AMI) in the HAAb-negative group (7%; P =.21), three were undergoing heparin therapy. No patient who was HAAb positive with a thrombotic event had thrombocytopenia or a significant decrease in platelet count.\nThe frequent exposure to heparin by patients with peripheral vascular disease is associated with a high incidence rate (21%) of HAAb formation, which makes it one of the more common hypercoagulable conditions in these patients. The patients who were HAAb positive had a 2.6-fold increase in perioperative thrombotic events. Thrombocytopenia or decreasing platelet counts were not reliable clinical markers for identifying patients who were HAAb positive. It is suggested that all patients who have undergone heparin therapy and who have an unexplained perioperative thrombotic event develop should undergo testing for HAAb.",

    "abstract": "Mortality and morbidity rates after vascular surgical procedures have been related to hospital volume. Hospitals in which greater volumes of vascular surgical procedures are performed tend to have statistically lower mortality rates than those hospitals in which fewer procedures are performed. Only a few studies have directly assessed the impact of the surgeon's volume on outcome. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to review a large state data set to determine the impact of surgeon volume on outcome after carotid endarterectomy (CEA), lower extremity bypass grafting (LEAB), and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (AAA).\nThe Florida Agency for Health Care Administration state admission data from 1992 to 1996 were obtained. The data included all nonfederal hospital admissions. Frequencies were calculated from first-listed International Classification of Diseases-9 codes. Multiple logistic regression was used to test the significance on outcome of surgeon volume, American Board of Surgery certification for added qualifications in general vascular surgery, hospital size, hospital volume, patient age, and gender.\nDuring this interval, there were 31,172 LEABs, 45,744 CEAs, and 13,415 AAAs performed. The in-hospital mortality rate increased with age. A doubling of surgeon volume was associated with a 4% reduction in risk for adverse outcome for CEA (P =.006), an 8% reduction for LEAB, and an 11% reduction for AAA ( P =.0002). However, although hospital volume was significant in predicting better outcomes for CEA and AAA procedures, it was not associated with better outcomes for LEAB. Certification for added qualifications in general vascular surgery was a significant predictor of better outcomes for CEA and AAA. Certified vascular surgeons had a 15% lower risk rate of death or complications after CEA (P =.002) and a 24% lower risk rate of a similar outcome after AAA (P =.009). However, for LEAB, certification was not significant.\nSurgeon volume and certification are significantly related to better patient outcomes for patients who undergo CEA and AAA. In addition, surgeons with high volumes demonstrated consistently lower mortality and morbidity rates than did surgeons with low volumes. Hospital volume for a given procedure also is correlated with better outcomes.",

Because of the presence of purulent drainage from the proximal and distal anastomotic regions and his comorbidities, a right through-knee guillotine amputation was performed, followed by graft excision and groin d\u00e9bridement. Right hip and thigh perfusion was preserved via arterial reconstruction by using a segment of endarterectomized popliteal artery, harvested from the amputated extremity. Arterial reconstruction with autologous tissue from an amputated extremity allowed us to balance our patient's overall risks with life and tissue preservation.

    "abstract": "We present a case of abdominal aortic aneurysm treated with an endovascular bifurcated aortic graft in which a periprosthetic leak caused by a tear in the polyester prosthesis appeared between 9 and 12 months after surgery. The tear appeared adjacent to a suture breakage that caused separation of two struts of the nitinol wire framework in the body of the stent graft. The leak was sealed with insertion of a new endovascular tube graft into the body of the bifurcation. Eight months later, the patient had a nonfatal rupture of the abdominal aortic aneurysm because detachment of the second limb from the bifurcation caused a new major periprosthetic leak. According to the manufacturer of this device, suture breakage with separation of metal components is commonly seen, but perforation of the polyester prosthesis caused by movement of the metal stent against the fabric has not been reported. It is likely that this occurred in our patient. Detachment of the second limb from the bifurcated stent, causing a rupture, has been described before. Increasing angulation and tortuosity of the stent graft, as a result of either remodeling of the sac or elongation of the stent, and reduced compliance to angulation after the stent-in-stent procedure might have contributed to the detachment in this case.",

    "abstract": "The vasoactive effects of propionyl-L-carnitine (PLC) on human arteries, including endothelial and smooth muscle cell influences, were studied.\nSmall (less than 200 microm) subcutaneous fat arteries (n = 19), obtained from human patients undergoing vascular surgery, were dissected and mounted in an arteriograph system that allowed measurement of lumen diameter and control of transmural pressure. To investigate the role of the endothelium, arteries were compared intact, intact and in the presence of either 0.3 mmol/L nitro-L-arginine (an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis) or 10 micromol/L indomethacin (an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis), or denuded of endothelium. After a 1-hour equilibration at a pressure of 50 mm Hg, arteries were precontracted 50% with an intermediate concentration of norepinephrine, and clinically relevant concentrations of PLC (0.1 to 100 micromol/L) were cumulatively added to the bath while the lumen diameter was continually measured.\nIntact arteries dose-dependently dilated to PLC, with the half maximal dilation occurring at 2.9 +/- 1.2 micromol/L, increasing diameter 91% +/- 5% at 100 micromol/L. In contrast, PLC had significantly less effect on deendothelialized arteries, increasing diameter only 24% +/- 11% at 100 micromol/L (P <.01 vs. intact). This indicates the endothelial dependency of this compound. Blockade of nitric oxide did not inhibit this vasodilation, with the half-maximal response occurring at 8.6 +/- 7 micromol/L, increasing diameter 85% +/- 8% at 100 micromol/L ( P >.05 vs. intact). However, this vasodilation was significantly diminished in the presence of indomethacin, which dilated arteries only 53% +/- 18% at 100 micromol/L (P <.01 vs. intact; P >.05 vs. denuded).\nPLC is an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, the mechanism of which is partially mediated by prostaglandin synthesis, not nitric oxide. The beneficial effects of this compound may, in part, be related to vasodilation and enhanced blood flow.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial resistance of refrigerated and cryopreserved aortic allografts in a highly virulent infection in a dog model was studied.\nThe infrarenal aorta of 12 dogs was replaced with either a cryopreserved aortic allograft (group I, n = 6) or a refrigerated aortic allograft (group II, n = 6) in infected sites. Allografts were harvested from dogs and stored for 1 week, either by cryopreservation (-140 degrees C) or refrigerated method (4 degrees C), in a preservation medium. At the time of implantation, induction of infection was achieved with an infected piece of knitted Dacron placed just beneath the allograft. The Dacron was contaminated in vitro by soaking it in a solution with Staphylococcus aureus PR209. All 12 dogs received no adjunct antibiotic or antithrombotic therapy. Four weeks after implantation, the animals were killed to recover the grafts for bacteriological and histological analyses. Bacterial results were expressed as colony-forming units (CFU)/cm2 of graft material.\nIn group I, only one allograft grew bacteria at 2. 16 x 10(6 )CFU/cm2, with a blood culture positive for S aureus. In group II, one dog died at 3 weeks from a false septic aneurysm rupture, all the allografts were infected (P <.05) with a mean bacterial count of 9.41 +/- 6.8 x 10(4) CFU/cm2, and three blood cultures were positive for S aureus. The patency of the grafts was analyzed at the time of recovery. Three laminar thrombi without occlusion were present in group I; none were present in group II. A better preserved endothelium in group I was revealed by means of histologic analysis staining with factor VIII antibody before implantation. After 4 weeks of implantation in the infected site, infected allografts presented polynuclear infiltrates in the media with a high degree of inflammatory reaction, and endothelial recovery was more significant in group I, with numerous young plump cells.\nThis study demonstrates that cryopreserved allografts implanted in infected sites in a dog model can produce greater bacterial resistance.",

    "abstract": "The beneficial effect of exercise in the retardation of the progression of cardiovascular disease is hypothesized to be caused, at least in part, by the elimination of adverse hemodynamic conditions, including flow recirculation and low wall shear stress. In vitro and in vivo investigations have provided qualitative and limited quantitative information on flow patterns in the abdominal aorta and on the effect of exercise on the elimination of adverse hemodynamic conditions. We used computational fluid mechanics methods to examine the effects of simulated exercise on hemodynamic conditions in an idealized model of the human abdominal aorta.\nA three-dimensional computer model of a healthy human abdominal aorta was created to simulate pulsatile aortic blood flow under conditions of rest and graded exercise. Flow velocity patterns and wall shear stress were computed in the lesion-prone infrarenal aorta, and the effects of exercise were determined.\nA recirculation zone was observed to form along the posterior wall of the aorta immediately distal to the renal vessels under resting conditions. Low time-averaged wall shear stress was present in this location, along the posterior wall opposite the superior mesenteric artery and along the anterior wall between the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. Shear stress temporal oscillations, as measured with an oscillatory shear index, were elevated in these regions. Under simulated light exercise conditions, a region of low wall shear stress and high oscillatory shear index remained along the posterior wall immediately distal to the renal arteries. Under simulated moderate exercise conditions, all the regions of low wall shear stress and high oscillatory shear index were eliminated.\nThis numeric investigation provided detailed quantitative data on the effect of exercise on hemodynamic conditions in the abdominal aorta. Our results indicated that moderate levels of lower limb exercise are necessary to eliminate the flow reversal and regions of low wall shear stress in the abdominal aorta that exist under resting conditions. The lack of flow reversal and increased wall shear stress during exercise suggest a mechanism by which exercise may promote arterial health, namely with the elimination of adverse hemodynamic conditions.",

Our results indicated that moderate levels of lower limb exercise are necessary to eliminate the flow reversal and regions of low wall shear stress in the abdominal aorta that exist under resting conditions. The lack of flow reversal and increased wall shear stress during exercise suggest a mechanism by which exercise may promote arterial health, namely with the elimination of adverse hemodynamic conditions.",

Shear stress temporal oscillations, as measured with an oscillatory shear index, were elevated in these regions. Under simulated light exercise conditions, a region of low wall shear stress and high oscillatory shear index remained along the posterior wall immediately distal to the renal arteries. Under simulated moderate exercise conditions, all the regions of low wall shear stress and high oscillatory shear index were eliminated.",

    "abstract": "Venous hemodynamics were evaluated in relation to the postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) 7 to 13 years after deep venous thrombosis (DVT).\nThe presence of flow, reflux, and compressibility of 1394 vein segments in 82 patients was assessed by means of duplex scanning. The venous outflow resistance was measured by means of strain-gauge plethysmography. The venous hemodynamics were related to the clinical severity of the PTS, characterized by the CEAP (clinical, etiologic, anatomic, pathophysiologic) classification.\nIn patients with severe clinical symptoms of PTS, the prevalence of reflux was significantly higher. There was no relationship between the severity of the PTS and the noncompressibility or the combination of reflux and noncompressibility or an increased venous resistance. By means of multiple regression analysis with the variables of age, gender, reflux, and venous resistance, age and reflux were shown to be the main contributors to the severity of PTS. Significantly more patients (64%) with severe signs of PTS had a combination of deep and superficial reflux. In each of the traceable vein segments, the mean of the CEAP classification was calculated for the vein segments with and without reflux. In the proximal superficial femoral vein (P <.001), distal superficial femoral vein (P <.05), and popliteal vein (P <.05), a significantly higher mean CEAP classification was found in the veins with reflux, whereas in the distal, long, and short saphenous veins, no such relationship was found.\nMost patients with severe PTS had a combination of deep and superficial reflux. Reflux in the deep proximal veins contributes significantly to the PTS.",

For 23 subjects, measurements were also performed during reactive hyperemia and then repeated after venous return from the foot was prevented by an ankle cuff.\nThere was a significant correlation between the ankle-brachial pressure index and the popliteal vein diameter (r = 0.35, P <.001) but a negative correlation between the ankle-brachial pressure index and venous flow velocity among patients with PVD (r = -0.24, P =.002). In PVD patients the diameter decreased further in reactive hyperemia, whereas it increased in control subjects ( P <.001). Preventing venous return from the foot in PVD patients led to diameter increase at rest and abolished the reduction in diameter caused by reactive hyperemia. Despite the reduction in diameter during reactive hyperemia, flow velocity increased less in patients with PVD than it did in control subjects (P =.01).\nChronic tissue ischemia results in constriction of the popliteal vein.

    "abstract": "Renovascular disease may lead to ischemia of the nephrons and to fibrosis, which is generally considered to be irreversible and progressive. We investigated the potential of revascularization to recover and stabilize renal function in patients with ischemic nephropathy.\nIn a retrospective analysis of all our 61 patients with ischemic nephropathy who underwent treatment with surgical revascularization, we determined the long-term course of renal function decline with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR; Cockcroft and Gault formula). With the assumption of normal renal function at age 25 years, the preoperative slope of EGFR and the postoperative slope of EGFR were determined from the EGFR before surgery, at the short-term follow-up examination (on average, 8 months after surgery), and at the long-term follow-up examination (on average, at 47 months after surgery). These declines in renal function were compared with EGFR values in age-matched and sex-matched samples from a large cross-sectional population study.\nThe overall surgical mortality rate amounted to 13.1%. Five patients became dialysis dependent-two with preexisting end-stage renal disease and three at later follow-up examination-and two patients, who before surgery were dialysis dependent, could be withdrawn from dialysis treatment. Shortly after the operation, the mean EGFR level had increased from 28.3 to 43.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 ( P <. 01). The rate of decline in renal function had decreased from an estimated -2.57 mL/min/1.73 m2/year before surgery (weighted mean: interquartile range, -2.71 to -1.98) to -0.66 mL/min/1.73 m2/year (weighted mean: interquartile range, -2.00 to -0.18) in the short-term interval to the long-term interval, which was even slightly better than the slope of -0.84 mL/min/1.73 m 2/year in the age-matched and sex-matched control population.\nSurgical revascularization in selected patients with renovascular disease and ischemic nephropathy restores renal function and makes the average long-term rate of decline in renal function equal to that of the general population. This indicates that in most patients a \"point-of-no-return\" has not yet been passed even though their renal function is already markedly impaired before surgery. Therefore, in well-selected patients with ischemic nephropathy, considerable improvement of renal function can be realized.",

Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), an extracellular matrix protein present in intimal hyperplastic lesions, has been shown to stimulate VSMC proliferation and migration. We hypothesized that the focal adhesion plaque, specifically the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) protein, may be important in the signal transduction pathway for TSP-1-induced VSMC migration.\nGrowth-arrested bovine aortic VSMCs were treated with TSP-1 (20 microg/mL) for set intervals (15, 30, and 120 minutes) and compared with VSMCs grown in serum-free medium (negative control) or in the presence of a known mitogen and chemotactic factor, platelet-derived growth factor (10 ng/mL; positive control). Crude cell lysates and anti-FAK immunoprecipitates were assayed for phosphotyrosine activity by means of antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting. The blots were quantified by means of densitometric analysis.\nTSP-1 increased tyrosine phosphorylation of three protein bands of molecular weights 68, 125 (consistent with FAK), and 180 kDa. Immunoprecipitation with FAK antibody, followed by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting, indicated that there was an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK at 15, 30, and 120 minutes in the TSP-1-treated groups (P <.05).\nTyrosine phosphorylation of FAK is induced by TSP-1 stimulated VSMCs. This suggests an outside-inside signaling pathway by which TSP-1 stimulates VSMC migration.",

Compared with an age-matched and sex-matched cohort of patients (n = 60 grafts in each group) with occlusive disease and who had femoral below-knee bypass grafts (FBP) only, patients undergoing infrainguinal reconstruction for PAA had a higher 5-year primary graft patency (92% +/- 4% for PAA vs 66% +/- 7% for FBP; P <.01). Duplex surveillance demonstrated a progressive increase in arterialized vein graft diameter in the PAA group versus the OD group. In univariant analysis, aneurysmal disease was a significant predictor of final follow-up diameter (P =.002). In a linear regression model, controlling for diameter at first follow-up after bypass grafting, first follow-up diameter was also predictive of final follow-up diameter.\nThese data suggested altered remodeling of vein grafts in patients with popliteal artery aneurysm, which may have a beneficial effect on patency.",

Compared with an age-matched and sex-matched cohort of patients (n = 60 grafts in each group) with occlusive disease and who had femoral below-knee bypass grafts (FBP) only, patients undergoing infrainguinal reconstruction for PAA had a higher 5-year primary graft patency (92% +/- 4% for PAA vs 66% +/- 7% for FBP; P <.01). Duplex surveillance demonstrated a progressive increase in arterialized vein graft diameter in the PAA group versus the OD group. In univariant analysis, aneurysmal disease was a significant predictor of final follow-up diameter (P =.002). In a linear regression model, controlling for diameter at first follow-up after bypass grafting, first follow-up diameter was also predictive of final follow-up diameter.",

    "abstract": "Contrast arteriography is the accepted gold standard for diagnosis and treatment planning in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease (RVD). In this study, the results of a selective policy of surgical renal artery reconstruction (RAR) with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) as the sole preoperative imaging modality are reviewed.\nFrom May 1993 to May 1998, 25 patients underwent RAR after clinical evaluation, and aortic/renal MRA performed with a gadolinium-enhanced and 3-dimensional phase contrast technique. Clinical presentations suggested severe RVD in all patients and included poorly controlled hypertension (16 patients), hospitalization for hypertensive crises and/or acute pulmonary edema (13), and deterioration of renal function within one year of operation (15). Thirteen patients had associated aortic pathologic conditions (12 aneurysms, 1 aortoiliac occlusive disease), and eight of these patients also underwent noncontrast computed tomography scans. Significant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine level, >/=2.0 mg/dL) was present in all but 4 patients with 14 of 25 patients having extreme (creatinine level, >/=3.0 mg/dL) dysfunction.\nHemodynamically significant RVD in the main renal artery was verified at operation in 37 of 38 reconstructed main renal arteries (24/25 patients). A single accessory renal artery was missed by MRA. RAR was comprehensive (bilateral or unilateral to a single-functioning kidney) in 21 of 25 patients and consisted of hepatorenal bypass graft (3 patients), combined aortic and RAR (13 patients), isolated transaortic endarterectomy (8 patients), and aortorenal bypass graft (1 patient). Early improvement in both hypertension control and/or renal function was noted in 21 of 25 patients without operative deaths or postoperative renal failure. Sustained favorable functional results at follow-up, ranging from 5 months to 4 years, were noted in 19 of 25 patients.\nMRA is an adequate preoperative imaging modality in selected patients before RAR. This strategy is best applied in circumstances where the clinical presentation suggests hemodynamically significant bilateral RVD and/or in patients at substantial risk of complications from contrast angiography.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative cerebral imaging has been considered not to be cost-effective in carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Yet, silent brain infarction (SBI) has been associated with the embolization potential of a severe carotid stenosis. Thus the presence of SBI may represent an additional indication for CEA in asymptomatic patients. We examined the predictive value of preoperatively detected silent cerebral lesions on early and late outcomes in patients undergoing CEA for asymptomatic carotid stenosis.\nPreoperative cerebral tomographic (CT) scans performed on 301 asymptomatic patients undergoing 346 CEAs from 1986 to 1995 were reviewed by a single neuroradiologist blinded to patients' records. Mean follow-up was 67. 3 months (range, 24-130 months). The degree of internal carotid lumen reduction was measured bilaterally in all patients (602 carotid arteries); carotid stenosis of 60% or more was found in 399 carotid arteries.\nOf the 103 (34%) CT scans positive for cerebral lesions, 58% were lacunar. No significant association was observed between the side of the cerebral lesion on CT scan and the severity of the corresponding carotid stenosis; 38 silent lesions were detected in the 203 hemispheres ipsilateral to carotid stenoses that were less than 60% versus 95 SBIs in the 399 hemispheres ipsilateral to carotid stenoses that were 60% or more (19% vs 24%; P =.2). There were no significant differences in the perioperative stroke/death rate in patients with or without cerebral CT lesions (2% vs 1%; odds ratio, 1.94; P =.6). Mortality rate during follow-up was 22% in patients with preoperative SBI and 15% in patients without SBI (P =.1). However, actuarial survival at 10 years was shorter (P =.02) in patients with SBI. Late stroke occurred in 11% of patients with preoperative SBI and in 3% of patients without preoperative SBI (P =.006). Cox regression analysis showed that both preoperative lacunar and nonlacunar infarctions were independent predictors of late stroke (hazard ratio, 3.6; P =.04; and hazard ratio, 7.1; P =.001; respectively).\nIn our experience, preoperative SBI did not occur more frequently in the hemisphere ipsilateral to asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis. Although our study lacks a medically treated control group, our data show that SBI is predictive of poor neurologic outcome in asymptomatic patients undergoing CEA. We conclude that CT before CEA, selectively applied, provides information on long-term neurologic prognosis and that a less aggressive attitude towards CEA in asymptomatic patients with SBI may be justified.",

Results of the two tests were blindly compared.

    "abstract": "Because endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is less invasive, some investigators have suggested that this increasingly popular technique should broaden the indications for elective AAA repair. The purpose of this study was to calculate quality-adjusted life expectancy rates after endovascular and open AAA repair and to estimate the optimal diameter for elective AAA repair in hypothetical cohorts of patients at average risk and at high risk.\nA Markov decision analysis model was used in this study. Assumptions were made on the basis of published reports and included the following: (1) the annual rupture rate is a continuous function of the AAA diameter (0% for <4 cm, 1% for 4.5 cm, 11% for 5.5 cm, and 26% for 6.5 cm); (2) the operative mortality rate is 1% for endovascular repair (excluding the risk of conversion to open repair) and 3.5% for open repair at age 70 years; and (3) immediate endovascular-to-open conversion risk is 5%, and late conversion rate is 1% per year. The main outcome measure in this study was the benefit of AAA repair in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The optimal threshold size (the AAA diameter at which elective repair maximizes benefit) was measured in centimeters.\nThe benefit of endovascular repair is consistently greater than that of open repair, but the additional benefit is small-0.1 to 0.4 QALYs. For men in average health with gradually enlarging AAAs with initial diameters of 4 cm, endovascular surgery reduces the optimal threshold diameter by very little: from 4.6 to 4.6 cm (no change) at age 60 years, from 4.8 to 4.7 cm at age 70 years, and from 5.1 to 4.9 cm at age 80 years. For older men in poor health, endovascular surgery reduces the optimal threshold diameter substantially (8.1 to 5.7 cm at age 80 years), but the benefit of repair in this population is small (0.2 QALYs).\nFor most patients, the indications for AAA repair are changed very little by the introduction of endovascular surgery. Only for older patients in poor health does endovascular surgery substantially lower the optimal threshold diameter for elective AAA repair.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair (EVR) is a less-invasive method for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) as compared with open surgical repair (OSR). The potential benefits of EVR include increased patient acceptance, less resource utilization, and cost savings. This study was designed to determine whether the EVR of AAAs is a cost-effective alternative to OSR.\nA cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a Markov decision analysis model to compute long-term survival rates in quality-adjusted life years and lifetime costs for a hypothetical cohort of patients who underwent either OSR or EVR. Probability estimates of the different outcomes of the two alternative strategies were made on the basis of a review of the literature. The average costs of (1) the immediate hospitalization ($16,016 for OSR, $20,083 for EVR), (2) the complications that resulted from each procedure, (3) the subsequent interventions, and (4) the surveillance protocol were determined on the basis of average resource utilization as reported in the literature and from our hospital's cost accounting system. Our measure of outcome was the cost-effectiveness ratio.\nFor our base-case analysis (70-year-old men with 5-cm AAAs), EVR was cost-effective with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $22,826-society usually is willing to pay for interventions with cost-effectiveness ratios of less than $60,000 (eg, cost-effectiveness ratios for coronary artery bypass grafting and dialysis are $9500 and $54,400, respectively). This conclusion did not vary significantly with increases in procedural costs for EVR (ie, if the cost of the endograft increased from $8000 to $12,000, EVR remained cost-effective with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $32,881). The cost-effectiveness of EVR was critically dependent on EVR producing a large reduction in the combined mortality and long-term morbidity rate (stroke, dialysis-dependent renal failure, major amputation, myocardial infarction) as compared with OSR (ie, a reduction in the combined mortality and long-term morbidity rate of OSR from 9.1% to 4.7% made EVR no longer cost-effective).\nDespite the high cost of new technology and the need for close postoperative surveillance, EVR is a cost-effective alternative for the repair of AAAs. However, the cost-effectiveness of this new technology is critically dependent on its potential to reduce morbidity and mortality rates as compared with OSR. EVR may not be cost-effective in medical centers where OSR can be performed with low risk.",

Several methods are described to achieve the delicate balance between essential flow in the fistula and an adequate limb perfusion pressure. We have developed a new method with duplex ultrasound scanning to quantitate the reduction in volume flow, which will allow effective dialysis and provide adequate limb perfusion.

    "abstract": "To clarify the mechanisms of structural changes underlying vein graft stenosis that limits efficacy of bypass grafting operation, we examined the accumulation and distribution of various extracellular matrix (ECM) components during neointima formation in rabbit vein grafts and analyzed their correlation with proliferation and phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs).\nAn autologous external jugular vein graft was transplanted into the carotid artery in 25 rabbits. After the restoration of blood flow, the graft was markedly dilated. Medial SMCs in the graft appeared to be injured, and they began to proliferate at day 4 and subsequently migrated and formed the neointima at day 7. The neointima observed at days 7 and 14 contained ECM components, including type I collagen, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate, and the intimal SMCs were phenotypically modulated from the differentiated-type (SM2-positive and SM embryonic-negative) to the dedifferentiated-type (SM2-negative and SM embryonic-positive) as determined with immunostainings for myosin heavy chain isoforms. The intimal SMC proliferation was maximal at 2 weeks and then decreased rapidly. However, the neointima continued to thicken thereafter throughout the 6-month period of the experiment, and ECM accumulation, such as type I collagen and decorin, a small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, was a prominent feature observed in the hypocellular region of the deep intima from 2 months after the transplantation. The phenotype of the intimal SMCs gradually returned to the differentiated-type from the deep intima after 2 months, but a small number of the intimal SMCs remained in the dedifferentiated phenotype even at 6 months after the operation.\nThe neointima in the vein graft was formed initially by means of migration and proliferation of the phenotypically modulated, dedifferentiated-type SMCs and continued to thicken by means of sustained ECM accumulation, including type I collagen and decorin, in association with the prolonged presence of the dedifferentiated-type SMCs. These chronologic features in cell kinetics and ECM accumulation may contribute to the frequent occurrence of graft wall thickening that occurs in the vein grafts.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the shear rate on red blood cell (RBC) aggregation with power Doppler ultrasound scanning (PDU), pulsed-wave Doppler scanning, and color Doppler flow imaging.\nEquine and porcine blood were circulated with a steady flow in a phantom with a diameter of 9.52 mm. The color Doppler flow imaging mode was used to estimate the velocity profile and the shear rate across the tube. A transfer function that related the Doppler scan power, measured in gray level with the PDU method, to the power, measured in decibels with the pulsed-wave Doppler scan technique, was used to estimate the echogenicity of blood and the level of aggregation.\nFor the four experiments reported, the power peaked at low shear rates probably because of increased RBC collisions and aggregation and then decreased thereafter because of disaggregation.

    "abstract": "Cell activation may play an important role in the production of venous insufficiency, just as leukocytes participate in the cause of venous ulcer. If activated, monocytes observed on venous endothelium can migrate into the venous wall and produce toxic metabolites and free oxygen radicals that may participate in valve destruction and venous wall weakening. At present, it remains uncertain to what degree leukocytes are actually activated in patients. This study was designed to explore the level of activation and to examine whether patient plasma contains an activator that leads to leukocyte activation of unstimulated naive leukocytes from volunteers without venous insufficiency disease.\nTwenty-one patients (4 men, 17 women), who ranged in age from 34 to 69 years (mean age, 53.2 years), with chronic venous disease were compared with 16 healthy control volunteers (4 men, 12 women), who ranged in age from 18 to 65 years (mean age, 48.4 years). All the patients underwent evaluation with Doppler ultrasound scanning and were classified with the CEAP score.1 Nearly all the patients who smoked or were hypertensive were excluded. The blood types (ABO and Rh) of the controls were matched to the study group. Isolates of patient whole blood, plasma, or leukocytes were incubated with isolates of control whole blood, plasma, or leukocytes to separate actual activation from spontaneously observed activation. The granulocyte activation was measured with nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction and quantitation of granulocyte pseudopod formation. Hydrogen peroxide production in patient plasma was measured with a recently developed electrode method.\nLeukocytes from healthy blood and patient plasma had significantly higher NBT-positive granulocyte counts than either patient blood, healthy blood, or patient blood incubated in healthy plasma. In a comparison of patient groups across the CEAP classes, the NBT-positive granulocyte counts were significantly greater in classes 4, 5, and 6 than in classes 2 and 3 (P <.001). Pseudopod formation was significantly greater in mixtures of granulocytes in healthy blood and patient plasma than in all other groups. There was no difference in the level of pseudopod formation in control leukocytes incubated with patient plasma in patients across the CEAP spectrum. The patient plasma produced significantly higher hydrogen peroxide values than did the controls.\nThese results suggest that patient plasma may contain an activating factor for granulocytes. The finding that activated neutrophils were fewer in number in patient whole blood than in healthy blood incubated in patient plasma could suggest that activated neutrophils in patients with chronic venous insufficiency might be trapped in the peripheral circulation. It is unknown what factors in the plasma might induce activation of naive neutrophils, but such activators could possibly be important in the pathogenesis of primary venous dysfunction and the development of chronic venous insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms of venous thrombogenesis have been studied by using animal models and cells in culture. The results from these systems may not, however, be relevant to the human condition. The aim of this study was to develop a method by which thrombus could be safely produced in a human vein in vivo. The model that was developed was used as a means of studying the changes in soluble adhesion molecule expression in human venous thrombogenesis.\nAn autologous thrombin extract was used to generate experimental thrombi in the disconnected portion of the long saphenous veins of 30 patients who were undergoing routine bilateral varicose vein surgery. The contralateral vein was perfused with thrombin extract diluent buffer to act as the control. The concentration of soluble P-, E- and L-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 were measured by means of specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in samples of blood taken from veins in which thrombus had formed and in contralateral control veins.\nThrombosis invariably formed when at least 100 IU of thrombin activity was administered. Thrombus formation was independent of the time that the thrombin extract was allowed to remain within the emptied vessel. Thrombosis never developed in control vessels that were similarly treated with the buffer used to dilute the thrombin extract. Experimental thrombi were composed mainly of red cells, with layers of fibrin next to platelet and leukocyte packages. These findings are similar to those observed in samples of established human venous thrombi. There were small but significantly higher levels of the adhesion molecules, soluble P-selectin, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in blood taken from veins in which experimental thrombi had formed, compared with controls (P =.015 and.007, respectively; Wilcoxon signed rank test). Serum levels of soluble L-selectin, E-selectin, and ICAM-1 were not affected by thrombosis.\nThis model is safe and reproducible. It produces thrombi with a morphology similar to that described for established human deep venous thrombi. The model may be appropriate for the study of the early changes that occur during human venous thrombogenesis and may also be of value in testing the efficacy of novel antithrombotic agents.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients who undergo carotid surgery ranges from 0.7% to 7.1%, but it still represents almost 50% of all perioperative complications. Because no data are available in literature about the impact of the anesthetic technique on such complications, a prospective randomized monocentric study was undertaken to evaluate the role of local anesthesia (LA) and general anesthesia (GA) on cardiac outcome.\nFrom November 1995 to February 1998, 107 patients were classified by the cardiologist as cardiac patients (IHD; history of myocardial infarction, previous myocardial revascularization procedures, or myocardial ischemia documented by means of positive electrocardiogram [ECG] stress test results) or noncardiac patients (NIHD; no history of chest pain or negative results for an ECG stress test). The patients were operated on after the randomization for the type of anesthesia (general or local). Continuous computerized 12-lead ECG was performed during the operative procedure and 24 hours postoperatively. The end points of the study were ECG modifications (upsloping or downsloping more than 2 mm) of the sinus tachycardia (ST) segment.\nFifty-five patients were classified as IHD, and 52 were classified as NIHD. Twenty-seven of the 55 IHD patients (49%) and 24 of 52 NIHD patients (46%) were operated on under GA. Thirty-six episodes of myocardial ischemia occurred in 22 patients (20.5%). Episodes were slightly more frequent (58%) and longer in the postoperative period (intraoperative, 10 +/- 5 min; postoperative, 60 +/- 45 min; P <. 001). As expected, the prevalence of myocardial ischemia was higher in the group of cardiac patients than in noncardiac group (15 of 55 patients [27%] vs 7 of 52 patients [13%]; P <.02). By comparing the two anesthetic techniques in the overall population, we found a similar prevalence of patients who had myocardial ischemia (GA, 12 of 52 [23%]; LA, 10 of 55 [18%]; P = not significant) and a similar number of ischemic episodes per patient (GA, 1.5 +/- 0.4; LA, 1.8 +/- 0.6; P = not significant). Episodes of myocardial ischemia were similarly distributed in intraoperative and postoperative periods in both groups. It is relevant that under GA, IHD patients represent most of the population who suffered myocardial ischemia (83%). On the contrary, in the group of patients operated on under LA, the prevalence was equally distributed in the two subpopulations.\nThe results confirm the different hemodynamic impact of the two anesthetic techniques. Patients who received LA had a rate of myocardial ischemia that was half that of patients who had GA. The small number of cardiac complications do not permit us to make any definitive conclusion on the impact of the two anesthetic techniques on early cardiac morbidity, but the relationship between perioperative ischemic burden and major cardiac events suggests that LA can be used safely, even in high-risk patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was the definition of the duplex scan parameters that best select patients for carotid endarterectomy.\nThis study was set in a regional vascular unit. Duplex scanning and angiography were performed prospectively on 50 patients who were symptomatic (100 carotid bifurcation) to identify the most accurate and sensitive duplex scan criteria to identify an 80% to 99% stenosis according to the European Carotid Symptomatic Trial. With data from the European Carotid Symptomatic Trial, we estimated the effect of three different approaches used to select patients for carotid endarterectomy. The first approach was the selection of patients for carotid surgery on the basis of duplex scanning alone with the most accurate duplex scan criteria (approach I). The second approach was the selection of patients for carotid surgery on the basis of duplex scanning alone with a 100% sensitive duplex scan criteria (approach II). The third approach was the selection of patients for angiography with duplex scanning (100% sensitive criteria) and then the use of angiography to define which patients should undergo surgery (approach III).\nAll three approaches appeared to have a similar potential in stroke reduction. However, approach I, which minimized the number of patients who underwent surgery (19% less than approach II) or invasive imaging (65% less than approach III), appeared to be the most appropriate.\nThese data support the selection of patients for carotid endarterectomy on the basis of duplex scanning alone.

    "abstract": "We investigated the usefulness of skin microcirculatory investigations to predict imminent major amputation in patients with non-reconstructible critical limb ischemia.\nOne hundred eleven patients with non-reconstructible chronic rest pain or small ulcers and an ankle blood pressure of 50 mm Hg or less or an ankle-to-brachial pressure index of 0.35 or less were included. Nailfold capillary microscopy (CM; big toe, sitting), transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcpO2; forefoot, supine; 44 degrees C), and laser Doppler perfusion measurements (LD; pulp of big toe, supine) were performed at rest and during reactive hyperemia. Patients were classified according to their skin microcirculatory status just before the start of the treatment in three groups: those with a \"good,\" \"intermediate,\" or \"poor\" microcirculation, according to a combination of predefined cutoff values (Poor: capillary density less than 20/mm2, absent reactive hyperemia in CM and LD, TcpO2 less than 10 mm Hg; good: capillary density of 20/mm2 or more, present reactive hyperemia in CM and LD, TcpO 2 of 30 mm Hg or more). Subsequently, patients received maximum conservative therapy from the surgeon, who was unaware of the microcirculatory results. After a follow-up period of as long as 36 months, limb survival and disposing factors were analyzed and compared with the initial microcirculatory status.\nCox regression analysis showed a significant prognostic value of the microcirculatory classification (hazard ratio = 0.28, P <.0001), but not of the Fontaine stage, ankle blood pressure, or the presence of diabetes mellitus for the occurrence of an amputation. Positive and negative predictive values were 73% and 67%, respectively. The cumulative limb survival at 6 and 12 months was 42% and 17% in the poor microcirculatory group, 80% and 63% in the intermediate microcirculatory group, and 88% and 88% in the good microcirculatory group ( P <.0001, log-rank).\nMicrocirculatory screening and classification is useful in detecting non-reconstructible critical ischemia that requires amputation, which is not detectable by means of the clinical stage or blood pressure parameters. Most of the poor patient group will require amputation. In the intermediate and good groups, nonsurgical treatment appears sufficient for limb salvage.",

    "abstract": "Prosthetic graft infection after aortic aneurysm surgery is a life-threatening complication. Treatment options include total graft excision and extra-anatomic bypass grafting or in situ replacement of the graft. The latter option is gaining increasing popularity, but the long-term outcome remains uncertain, particularly in light of the increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We performed a prospective nonrandomized study to assess the outcome after graft excision and in situ replacement with a rifampicin-bonded prosthesis for the treatment of major aortic graft infection.\nIn a 6-year period from January 1992 to December 1997, 11 patients (eight men, three women) with major aortic graft infection underwent total graft excision and in situ replacement with a rifampicin-bonded prosthesis. The median age of the patients was 66 years (range, 49 to 78 years). Four patients had a hemorrhage from an aortoenteric fistula, three had a retroperitoneal abscess, two had graft occlusion, one had a perigraft collection shown by means of computed tomography, and one had a ruptured suprarenal false aneurysm. Organisms were cultured from 10 patients.\nMRSA was isolated in two patients, both of whom had originally undergone repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Two patients died (18.2%) within 30 days, and three patients (27.6%) had nonfatal complications (peritoneal candidiasis, transient renal impairment, and profound anorexia). Two patients died late in the follow-up period. Seven patients remain alive and clinically free of infection.\nThe long-term results after total graft excision and in situ replacement with a rifampicin-bonded prosthesis appear to be favorable. However, MRSA aortic graft infection appears to be associated with a poor prognosis.",

We sought to evaluate the type, quality, and focus of vascular disease information presented on the Internet and the role in patient education with simple search techniques.\nThe arbitrarily chosen search phrases \"abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA),\" \"carotid surgery (CEA),\" \"claudication surgery,\" and \"leg gangrene surgery\" were entered into five common Internet search engines. No attempt was made to refine searches. As indicated by the search engines, the 50 most commonly encountered web sites for both AAA and CEA were reviewed. The first 25 claudication sites and the first 25 gangrene sites were combined for a total of 50 leg ischemia (LIS) sites. An information score (IS) was developed as a weighted score ranging from 0 (poor) to 100 (outstanding) and was designed to assess how well the web page educated the patient about the disease, the treatment options, and the medical and surgical complications. Each vascular surgery web site was classified according to the author, the referenced information source, and the therapeutic recommendations. This was followed by an evaluation of each web site with the IS independently scored by two observers.\nOf the 150 web sites, 146 were accessible. Ninety-six sites (65.8%) had no useful patient-oriented information (IS < 10). The mean IS and the ranges were: AAA, 14.9 (0 to 72.0); CEA, 17.5 (0 to 77.0); and LIS, 12.2 (0 to 44.5; P =.9). The mean IS of the 59 sites with scores of more than 10 were: AAA, 39.8 (n = 17); CEA, 44.8 (n = 19); and LIS, 24.8 (n = 23; P <.01, as compared with LIS scores). Differences in IS between observers were not significant (P =.9).

Recently, there have been dramatic improvements in the results of axillofemoral bypass grafting (AXFB) followed by excision of the IRAI that have gone relatively unrecognized. The purpose of this report is the presentation of modern-day results in the treatment of IRAI with conventional surgical methods.\nFrom January 1, 1983, through June 30, 1998, patients with IRAI underwent treatment with AXFB and complete excision of the IRAI. The patients were followed for survival, limb salvage, and AXFB graft patency. The results were tabulated with life-table methods.\nDuring the 15-year study period, 60 patients (51 men, nine women; mean age, 68 years) underwent treatment for IRAI (50 graft infections, including 16 graft-enteric fistulae, and 10 primary aortic infections). The mean follow-up period was 41 months. The perioperative mortality rate was 13% (12% for graft infection, and 20% for primary infection). The overall 2-year and 5-year survival rates were 67% and 47%, respectively. The limb salvage rates at 2 and 5 years were 93% and 82%, respectively. The 5-year primary AXFB graft patency rate was 73%.\nThese results show an improvement with the conventional management of IRAI equal or superior to those results reported with alternative methods, including femoral vein grafts or aortic allografts. These results should be regarded as the modern standard with which alternative therapies can be compared.",

    "abstract": "To determine the percentage of elective abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs)/aortoiliac aneurysms that currently can be repaired with endovascular grafts (EVGs), the reasons for rejection of EVGs, and the future role of EVG in the treatment of AAA.\nFrom January 1997 to May 1998, patients at three hospitals (a university hospital, a university-affiliated teaching hospital, and a Veterans Administration hospital with university faculty and residents) were evaluated for EVGs as part of a national clinical trial with grafts manufactured by Endovascular Technologies (EVT, Menlo Park, Calif). All patients at two hospitals and patients treated by the participating surgeons at the third hospital were screened for EVG. Patients with AAAs that were ruptured, symptomatic, or involved renal or mesenteric arteries and patients who declined treatment were excluded from the study. Evaluation included clinical examination, computed tomography scan, and selective arteriography. The decision to proceed with EVG was made by the vascular surgeon, with input and concurrence of medical personnel from a company with extensive experience in endograft repair. The main outcome measures were the determination of the percentage of elective AAAs currently being treated with an EVG and the reasons for exclusion of patients from EVG placement.\nA total of 162 patients underwent elective treatment of an AAA, 22 (14%) with an EVG (14 bifurcated, eight tube) and 140 (86%) with traditional resection. Indications for not proceeding with an EVG included insufficient proximal cuff in 29 patients (21%), distal common iliac aneurysm or insufficient distal iliac neck in 29 patients (21%), proximal neck too large for an EVG in 24 patients (17%), symptomatic iliac stenosis in 23 patients (16%), iliac stenosis precluding introducer passage in 17 patients (12%), patient preference in 11 patients (8%), and calcification, kink, or extensive thrombus involving the proximal neck precluding safe graft attachment in seven patients (5%). Of the 22 patients treated with an EVG, three were converted to open resection, because of iliac stenosis in two patients and premature stent deployment in one patient (initial technical success rate, 86%).\nBased on currently available technology, 80% of patients were not candidates for an EVG because of proximal calcification, short aortic or distal cuff, coexisting distal iliac aneurysm, and stenotic iliac disease. Even with the use of adjunctive procedures, most patients still require open repair. Significant changes in design will be necessary to apply these devices to most patients with an AAA.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) includes transabdominal (TA), retroperitoneal (RP), and endovascular (EV) repair. This study compares the cost and early (30-day) results of a consecutive series of AAA repair by means of these three methods in a single institution.\nA total of 125 consecutive AAA repairs between February 1993 and August 1997 were reviewed. Risk factors, 30-day morbidity and mortality rates, and hospital stay and cost were analyzed according to method of repair (TA, RP, EV). Cost was normalized by means of a conversion factor to maintain confidentiality. Cost analysis includes conversion to TA repair (intent to treat) in the EV group.\nOne hundred twenty-five AAA repairs were performed with the TA (n = 40), RP (n = 24), or EV (n = 61) approach. Risk factors among the groups (age, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cigarette smoking) were not statistically different, and thus the groups were comparable. The average estimated blood loss was significantly lower for EV (300 mL) than for RP (700 mL) and TA (786 mL; P>.05). Statistically significant higher cost for TA and RP for pharmacy and clinical laboratories (likely related to increased length of stay [LOS]) and significantly higher cost for EV in supplies and radiology (significantly reducing cost savings in LOS) were revealed by means of an itemized cost analysis. Operating room cost was similar for EV, TA, and RP. There were six perigraft leaks (9.6%) and six conversions to TA (9.6%) in the EV group.\nThere were no statistically significant differences in mortality rates among TA, RP, and EV. Respiratory failure was significantly more common after TA repair, compared with RP or EV, whereas wound complications were more common after RP. Overall cost was significantly higher for TA repair, with no significant difference in cost between EV and RP. EV repair significantly shortened hospital stay and intensive care unit (ICU) use and had a lower morbidity rate. Cost savings in LOS were significantly reduced in the EV group by the increased cost of supplies and radiology, accounting for a similar cost between EV and RP. Considering the increased resource use preoperatively and during follow-up for EV patients, the difference in cost between TA and EV may be insignificant. EV repair is unlikely to save money for the health care system; its use is likely to be driven by patient and physician preference, in view of a significant decrease in the morbidity rate and length of hospital stay.",

    "abstract": "Complete visceral artery revascularization is recommended for the treatment of chronic visceral ischemia. However, in rare cases, it may not be possible to revascularize either the celiac or superior mesenteric (SMA) arteries. We have managed a series of patients with isolated revascularization of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and now report our experience gained over a period of three decades.\nRecords were reviewed from 11 patients with chronic visceral ischemia who underwent isolated IMA revascularization (n = 8) or who, because of failure of concomitant celiac or SMA repairs, were functionally left with an isolated IMA revascularization (n = 3). All the patients had symptomatic chronic visceral ischemia documented with arteriography. Five patients had recurrent visceral ischemia after failed visceral revascularization, and two patients had undergone resection of ischemic bowel. The celiac or the SMA was unsuitable for revascularization in five cases, and extensive adhesions precluded safe exposure of the celiac or the SMA in five cases. IMA revascularization techniques included: bypass grafting (n = 4), transaortic endarterectomy (n = 4), reimplantation (n = 2), and patch angioplasty (n = 1).\nThere was one perioperative death, and the remaining 10 patients had cured or improved conditions at discharge. One IMA repair thrombosed acutely but was successfully revascularized at reoperation. The median follow-up period was 6 years (range, 1 month to 13 years). Two patients had recurrent symptoms develop despite patent IMA repairs and required subsequent visceral revascularization; interruption of collateral circulation by prior bowel resection may have contributed to recurrence in both patients. Objective follow-up examination with arteriography or duplex scanning was available for eight patients at least 1 year after IMA revascularization, and all underwent patent IMA repairs. There were no late deaths as a result of bowel infarction.\nIsolated IMA revascularization may be useful when revascularization of other major visceral arteries cannot be performed and a well-developed, intact IMA collateral circulation is present. In this select subset of patients with chronic visceral ischemia, isolated IMA revascularization can achieve relief of symptoms and may be a lifesaving procedure.",

    "abstract": "Although the association between inflammation and atherosclerosis is well established, the biologic events that trigger the local inflammatory response within plaque are not fully understood. Cytotoxic free radicals and infectious agents, both of which are associated with an inflammatory response, have previously been implicated in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. In this study, we analyzed carotid plaque for evidence of oxidative vascular injury by determining the presence and distribution of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitrotyrosine formation and for evidence of infection with cytomegalovirus.\nCarotid plaque from 51 patients who underwent endarterectomy for either primary (n = 37) or recurrent (n = 14) stenosis were examined histologically (hematoxylin-eosin staining and Masson's trichrome staining) and with immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies to alpha-smooth muscle actin, macrophages (CD68), T-lymphocytes (CD3), and T-cell activation (human leukocyte antigen-DR). Twenty-eight specimens from patients with primary (n = 15) and recurrent (n = 13) stenosis were examined for the presence of iNOS and nitrotyrosine with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (iNOS). Twenty-three additional specimens (22 primary, and 1 recurrent) were analyzed with antibodies to p53, cytomegalovirus, and the polymerase chain reaction (cytomegalovirus, n = 8).\nPrimary atherosclerotic lesions were either complex heterogenous cellular plaques (n = 29) or relatively acellular fibrous plaques (n = 8). Ten of 14 recurrent plaques were either complex or fibrous lesions, and the remaining four were typical of myointimal thickening. CD68-positive staining cells were detected in all specimens regardless of their structural morphology. CD3-positive cells were interspersed between macrophages in all heterogeneous cellular plaques and only infrequently noted in fibrous plaques. iNOS and nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity were detected in macrophages and smooth muscle cells in all complex and fibrous plaques and in two of four myointimal plaques. The presence of iNOS and nitrotyrosine in plaque correlated with the existence of symptoms in 80% of primary and 62% of recurrent lesions. Cytomegalovirus was detected in only two of 23 carotid specimens (9%).\nThe association between ischemic cerebrovascular symptoms and iNOS and nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity in complex primary and recurrent carotid plaque and the infrequent occurrence of cytomegalovirus in primary carotid lesions suggests that ongoing free radical oxidative damage rather than viral infection may contribute to plaque instability in patients with complex and fibrous carotid plaques.",

    "abstract": "Patients with recurrent carotid artery stenosis are sometimes referred for carotid angioplasty and stenting because of reports that carotid reoperation has a higher complication rate than primary carotid endarterectomy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a difference exists between outcomes of primary carotid endarterectomy and reoperative carotid surgery.\nMedical records were reviewed for all carotid operations performed from September 1993 through March 1998 by vascular surgery faculty at a single academic center. The results of primary carotid endarterectomy and operation for recurrent carotid stenosis were compared.\nA total of 390 operations were performed on 352 patients. Indications for primary carotid endarterectomy (n = 350) were asymptomatic high-grade stenosis in 42% of the cases, amaurosis fugax and transient ischemic symptoms in 35%, global symptoms in 14%, and previous stroke in 9%. Indications for reoperative carotid surgery (n = 40) were symptomatic recurrent lesions in 50% of the cases and progressive high-grade asymptomatic stenoses in 50%. The results of primary carotid endarterectomy were no postoperative deaths, an overall stroke rate of 1.1% (three postoperative strokes, one preoperative stroke after angiography), and no permanent cranial nerve deficits. The results of operations for recurrent carotid stenosis were no postoperative deaths, no postoperative strokes, and no permanent cranial nerve deficits. In the primary carotid endarterectomy group, the mean hospital length of stay was 2.6 +/- 1. 1 days and the mean hospital cost was $9700. In the reoperative group, the mean length of stay was 2.6 +/- 1.5 days and the mean cost was $13,700. The higher cost of redo surgery is accounted for by a higher preoperative cerebral angiography rate (90%) in redo cases as compared with primary endarterectomy (40%).\nIn this series of 390 carotid operations, the procedure-related stroke/death rate was 0.8%. There were no differences between the stroke-death rates after primary carotid endarterectomy and operation for recurrent carotid stenosis. Operation for recurrent carotid stenosis is as safe and effective as primary carotid endarterectomy and should continue to be standard treatment.",

In the reoperative group, the mean length of stay was 2.6 +/- 1.5 days and the mean cost was $13,700. The higher cost of redo surgery is accounted for by a higher preoperative cerebral angiography rate (90%) in redo cases as compared with primary endarterectomy (40%).",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to define a normal range of distal graft velocity (DGV) and peak systolic velocity (PSV) on the basis of outflow level and maximum graft diameter for infrainguinal reversed vein bypass grafting (RVG).\nThis study was designed as a prospective study of consecutive patients who underwent infrainguinal RVG from 1994 to 1997 in a university hospital and university-affiliated teaching hospital. All patients who underwent infrainguinal bypass grafting from 1994 to 1997 were placed in a prospective protocol with duplex scanning to better define the hemodynamics of normally functioning RVG. Graft revisions were performed for patients with velocity ratios of more than 2.5. One hundred twenty-one patients were entered into this protocol, and 114 were followed more than 3 months after RVG. Seven patients were excluded: five for death within 3 months, one for graft infection, and one for graft occlusion before the baseline duplex scanning. DGV and PSV were determined for each type of outflow (popliteal, crural, and pedal) and for ranges of maximum graft diameter. These then were correlated with subsequent graft occlusion or graft revision (graft failure).\nGrafts with larger diameters were associated with lower DGVs (P <.001), and more proximal outflow arteries were associated with higher DGVs (popliteal, 75 cm/s; crural, 50 cm/s; and pedal, 40 cm/s; P <.01). The mean PSVs were 150, 140, and 122 cm/s for popliteal, crural, and pedal grafts, respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant. The assisted primary patency rates for the grafts in this series were 99%, 92%, and 92% at 1, 2, and 3 years.\nGraft diameter and location of the distal anastomosis significantly affect the flow velocity in RVG. Other variables did not influence these parameters. Currently established criteria for arteriography or graft repair on the basis of graft velocity parameters may be improved if they can be modified depending on diameter and outflow.",

    "abstract": "Although duplex surveillance of infrainguinal bypass grafts is widely accepted, the optimal frequency and intensity of graft surveillance remains controversial. Earlier reports have suggested that grafts can be stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the presence or absence of early graft flow disturbances. The purpose of this study was to provide long-term data in determining whether early graft flow disturbances detected by means of duplex scanning can predict the development of intrinsic vein graft stenosis.\nWe reviewed a series of patients undergoing prospective duplex graft surveillance after autogenous infrainguinal bypass grafting procedures from 1987 to 1997. Patients included in the study underwent at least one duplex scan within 3 months of graft implantation and were observed for a minimum of 6 months. Grafts were categorized as abnormal when a focal flow disturbance with a peak systolic velocity greater than 150 cm/s was identified within 3 months of graft implantation.\nOf 341 vein grafts in 296 patients who met inclusion criteria, 89 grafts (26%) required revision for intrinsic stenosis; the mean follow-up period was 35 months (range, 6 months to 10 years). Early flow disturbances were detected in 84 (25%) grafts. Grafts with early flow disturbances were more likely to ultimately require revision (43% vs 21%; P =. 0001) and required initial revision earlier (8 months vs 16 months; P =.019). Eighty-two percent of initial graft revisions occurred in the first 2 postoperative years; 69% occurred in the first year. However, an annual 2% to 4% incidence of late-appearing graft stenosis persisted during long-term follow-up. An additional 24 patients (7% of grafts) required an inflow or outflow reconstruction.\nGrafts with early postoperative flow disturbances detected by means of duplex scanning have nearly three times the incidence of graft-threatening stenosis and an earlier requirement for revision, when compared with normal grafts. This suggests that the biology and etiology of these lesions may differ. These data support not only aggressive efforts to detect early graft lesions to stratify grafts at highest risk, but also continued lifelong graft surveillance to detect late-appearing lesions, inflow and outflow disease progression, and maximize graft patency.",

    "abstract": "The use of vibrating tools has been shown to cause Raynaud's syndrome (RS) in a variety of workers, including those who use chain saws, chippers, and grinders. The diagnosis of RS in workers who use vibrating tools is difficult to document objectively. We studied a patient cohort with RS caused by the use of a vibrating pneumatic air knife (PAK) for removal of automobile windshields and determined our ability to document RS in these workers by means of digital hypothermic challenge testing (DHCT), a vascular laboratory study that evaluates digital blood pressure response to cooling.\nSixteen male autoglass workers (mean age, 36 years) with RS were examined by means of history, physical examination, arm blood pressures, digital photoplethysmography, screening serologic studies for underlying connective tissue disorder, and DHCT.\nNo patient had RS before they used a PAK. The mean onset of RS (color changes, 100%; pain, 93%; parathesias, 75%) with cold exposure was 3 years (range, 1.5 to 5 years) after initial PAK use (mean estimated PAK use, 2450 hours). Fifty-six percent of workers smoked cigarettes. The findings of the physical examination, arm blood pressures, digital photoplethysmography, and serologic testing were normal in all patients. At 10 degrees C cooling with digital cuff and patient cooling blanket, a significant decrease in digital blood pressure was shown by means of DHCT in 100% of test fingers versus normothermic control fingers (mean decrease, 75%; range, 25% to 100%; normal response, less than 17%; P <.001). The mean follow-up period was 18 months (range, 1 to 47 months). No patient continued to use the PAK, but symptoms of RS were unchanged in 69% and worse in 31%.\nPAK use is a possible cause of vibration-induced RS. The presence of RS in workers who use the PAK was objectively confirmed by means of DHCT. Cessation of PAK use in the short term did not result in symptomatic improvement.",

    "abstract": "Patients with non-reconstructable critical limb ischemia generally undergo medical treatment only to prevent or postpone amputation. There is some evidence that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) stimulates ischemic wound healing. Thus, this could benefit limb survival through improved skin perfusion. We investigated the effect of SCS versus conservative treatment on skin microcirculation in relation to treatment outcome in patients with non-reconstructable critical limb ischemia.\nStandard medical treatment plus SCS was compared with only standard medical treatment in a multicenter randomized controlled trial comprised of 120 patients with surgically non-reconstructable chronic rest pain or ulceration. We investigated skin microcirculation by means of capillary microscopy, laser Doppler perfusion, and transcutaneous oxygen measurements in the foot. The microcirculatory status just before treatment was classified in three categories (poor, intermediate, and good) and was related to limb survival after a minimum follow-up period of 18 months.\nClinical parameters, peripheral blood pressures, and limb survival rates showed no significant differences between the SCS and standard groups during the follow-up period. In both treatment groups, amputation frequency after 18 months was high in patients with an initially poor microcirculatory skin perfusion (SCS 80% vs standard treatment 71%; NS) and low in those with a good skin perfusion (29% vs 11 %, respectively; NS). In patients with an intermediate skin microcirculation amputation, frequency was twice as low in patients additionally treated with SCS as in the standard treatment group (48% vs 24%; P =.08). In these patients, microcirculatory reactive hyperemia during the follow-up period reduced in the standard group but not in the SCS group (P <.01).\nSelection on the basis of the initial microcirculatory skin perfusion identifies patients in whom SCS can improve local skin perfusion and limb survival.",

Both cases were diagnosed by means of routine carotid duplex ultrasound scanning, and neither patient was operated on. With medical therapy with oral anticoagulants, the two lesions spontaneously disappeared without any clinical sequel, and no evidence of infarcts was shown by means of repeated computed tomography brain scans. After uneventful 2- and 3-year follow-up periods, there was no evidence of recurrence. This is the first published data on asymptomatic mobile carotid lesions and their natural history that shows a benign course in a long-term follow-up period. We suggest that a non-surgical approach may be considered selectively in high-risk symptom-free patients who have mobile and floating internal carotid artery lesions.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord ischemia and resulting paraplegia represent a major complication associated with surgical repair of the thoracoabdominal aorta. Although the mechanism of spinal neuronal degeneration during ischemia is unclear, it may involve excessive calcium influx via N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs). The neuroprotective capacity of intrathecal (IT) administration of the selective N-type VSCC blocker ziconotide, previously shown to be potently analgesic, was studied.\nIn a rat aortic occlusion model, spinal cord ischemia was induced for 8, 9, or 10 minutes by occluding the descending thoracic aorta. Ziconotide was administered IT as (1) a continuous infusion of 300 or 600 ng/kg/h initiated 24 hours before ischemia and continuing an additional 24 hours or (2) a 0.3 microgram bolus injected 45 minutes before the induction of ischemia. Animals were allowed to live for 24 hours, and recovery of motor function was evaluated during this period. Spinal cords were processed using a silver impregnation technique and microtubule-associated protein type II (MAP2) immunohistochemistry.\nContinuous IT infusion of ziconotide provided significant protection against 8- and 9-minute occlusions, but not 10-minute occlusions, as indicated by recovery of motor function, degree of spinal neuronal degeneration, and loss of MAP2 immunoreactivity. Acute IT pretreatment with ziconotide provided transient protection during the initial 4 hours of reperfusion; however, this protective effect was no longer present at 24 hours.\nThese data implicate N-type VSCC activation in spinal neuronal degeneration caused by transient spinal ischemia, because selective blockade of this channel by continuous IT infusion of ziconotide was protective against injurious intervals of spinal ischemia. Based on these findings, ziconotide may provide both neuroprotection and preemptive analgesia for aortic aneurysm surgery.",

    "abstract": "The gross, light microscopic, and scanning microscopic appearance of arterial and venous anastomoses in expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) access grafts constructed with nonpenetrating clips were compared with that of those constructed with polypropylene suture. We hypothesized that clip-constructed anastomoses would provide controlled approximation of native vessel intimal and medial components with the ePTFE grafts. We further hypothesized that anastomotic healing with clips would involve primarily an intimal cellular response, as compared with suture-constructed anastomoses in which cells within the media and adventitia walls participate.\nFemoral artery to femoral vein arteriovenous (AV) grafts were constructed in five dogs using 4-mm internal diameter ePTFE graft material. Each animal received one AV graft with anastomoses constructed by using polypropylene sutures in one leg and one AV graft with anastomoses constructed with Vascular Closure System clips in the contralateral leg. Animals were given aspirin for the duration of the study, and grafts were explanted at 5 weeks. At the time of explantation, graft segments were grossly evaluated and then underwent light and scanning electron microscopic analysis.\nAt the time of explantation, all access grafts were patent. Joining the ePTFE grafts to the native vessels with clips resulted in minimal vessel wall damage. The lumenal contours of the discontinuous approximation were smooth and without gross endothelial disruption. These observations are in contrast to the lumenal compromise and endothelial disturbance associated with the sutured anastomoses. Furthermore, hemostasis was achieved immediately in the clipped grafts, decreasing the incidence of perianastomic hematoma. Finally, cellular reconstitution occurred at the anastomotic cleft in both the sutured and the clipped junctions. The neointima exhibited an endothelial cell lining on the lumenal surface and the presence of alpha-smooth muscle cell actin positive cells within the subendothelial layer.\nVascular Closure System clips are a viable alternative to suture for the approximation of ePTFE AV access grafts to native blood vessels. The use of the clips resulted in a more streamlined anastomosis, with decreased vessel wall damage, immediate hemostasis, and a trend toward shorter procedure times.",

    "abstract": "The feasibility of the video-assisted insertion of a new sutureless vascular prosthesis was studied.\nSeven sheep, weighing 25 to 35 kg, were operated on under general anesthesia. The animals were intubated with a single-lumen endotracheal tube and placed in the right lateral decubitus position. A thoracoscope was introduced in the 11th intercostal space, and a minithoracotomy (4 to 5 cm) was performed in the seventh intercostal space. After retraction of the lung, a short segment (10 cm) of the descending thoracic aorta was exposed. Our prosthesis was made of Dacron and was specifically designed to be inserted without a suture. After systemic heparinization, the aorta was cross-clamped with two vascular clamps introduced into the thoracic cavity through two 5-mm thoracic incisions. The aorta was either replaced (five cases) or bypass grafted (two cases). At the completion of the procedure, blood pressure was pharmacologically increased (5 mg intravenous bolus of epinephrine), and each anastomosis was checked for bleeding. All animals were killed, and the prosthesis was retrieved for macroscopic examination.\nThe procedure was completed in each case without extension of the minithoracotomy. Insertion of the prosthesis was easy and fast, and completion of each anastomosis required 10 to 15 minutes. A 3- to 4-mm space between each clip was sufficient for proper attachment. All procedures were performed in less than 120 minutes. No bleeding was observed at the level of each anastomosis, even when a sustained high blood pressure was induced. The proper insertion of the prosthesis and the absence of any anastomotic stenosis was confirmed by means of macroscopic examination.\nVideo-thoracoscopic replacement or bypass grafting of the descending thoracic aorta was easy with this new sutureless vascular prosthesis. Minimally invasive vascular surgery might be facilitated with such a prosthesis. However, long-term animal studies are required before human implantation can be undertaken.",

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric arterial occlusion is an abdominal catastrophe that carries high morbidity and mortality rates. Current diagnostic methods, however, lack sensitivity and specificity and do not provide information about the viability of the affected bowel. Early diagnosis and intervention would improve patient outcomes and survival rates. The basic electrical rhythm (BER) is the omnipresent electrical slow wave of the gastrointestinal tract that characterizes the underlying electrical activity of the bowel. BER frequency is known to fall with ischemia. Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) can detect BER by measuring the magnetic fields generated by the electrical activity of the smooth muscle of the small bowel. The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of a SQUID to detect mesenteric ischemia in a free-lying section of small bowel in an animal model of acute superior mesenteric artery occlusion.\nSeven adult male rabbits (six experimental and one control) were studied with transabdominal SQUID and electrode recordings during baseline and after the induction of mesenteric ischemia with balloon occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. Continuous recordings were taken for 120 minutes of ischemia and analyzed with autoregressive spectral analysis to determine the BER frequency during specific time points of the study. Two independent investigators blinded to the experimental preparation examined the results to determine whether there was decreased BER frequency and thus ischemia. The results are expressed as mean +/- SEM, and paired t tests were used to determine statistical significance.\nBER was detected in all seven animals and fell from 10.7 +/- 0.5 cpm to 7.0 +/- 1.8 cpm after 30 minutes of ischemia in the magnetic channels (P <.05, with t test). The fall in BER was detected by the SQUID in all six experimental animals. The blinded observers correctly identified healthy and ischemic magnetic data recording, with a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 100%.\nSQUIDs can noninvasively detect bowel ischemia early in a free-lying segment of small bowel in this animal model with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity.",

    "abstract": "Prognostic information about graft outcome, obtained by using a new method for intraoperative measurement of vascular impedance, was evaluated.\nHydraulic impedance was measured in 136 infrainguinal bypass grafts that were entered into a multicenter trial. Seventy femoropopliteal and 66 femorocrural polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts were used. The arterial impedance measurement involved a silicon bypass graft temporarily inserted between the proximal and distal anastomoses sites. A flowmeter probe and a pressure transducer were incorporated into the tube. The digitally stored waveforms were subjected to a fast Fourier transformation and both input (Z(x)) and characteristic (Z(0)) impedances, as well as phase relations, were computed and related to graft outcome after 3 years.\nSignificant prognostic information for both popliteal and crural grafts was provided by means of the phase angle of the first harmonic. Primary and secondary patency rates for popliteal bypasses were 45% +/- 1% and 65% +/- 2% for phase angles greater than -40 degrees (n = 57) and 37% +/- 1% and 40% +/- 1% for phase angles less than -40 degrees (n = 13, p(prim ) = not significant, p(sec) < 0.01). For crural grafts, the secondary patency rates were 49% +/- 1% and 61% +/- 2% for phase angles greater than -40 degrees (n = 53) and 15% +/- 1% and 0% for phase angles less than -40 degrees (n = 13, P <.01). All crural bypass grafts with phase angles less than -40 degrees occluded within 16 months. Steady flow resistance, as well as Z(x) and Z(0), failed to indicate a significant relation to graft prognosis.\nThis method provides reliable prognostic information regarding graft patency and opens hydraulic impedance measurement to clinical surgery. The phase lag between flow and pressure curves, as expressed by the phase angle of the first harmonic, provides significant prognostic information.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to correlate the changes in concentration of S-100 protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during and after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) surgery with the results of somatosensory and motor evoked potential monitoring.\nThe study was designed as a prospective study at St Antonius Hospital in Nieuwegein, The Netherlands. The participants were 19 patients who were undergoing elective TAAA surgery. CSF samples for analysis of S-100 protein were drawn after the induction of anesthesia, during the cross-clamp period of the critical aortic segment, after 5 minutes of reperfusion of this segment, during the closure of the skin, and 24 hours after the closure of the skin. In all the patients, continuous intraoperative recording of myogenic motor potentials evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation (tcMEP) and somatosensory potentials evoked by stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve took place to monitor the integrity of the spinal cord. The operative technique consisted of staged or sequential clamping to maximize the beneficial effect of the distal perfusion by the left heart bypass, continuous CSF drainage to keep the CSF pressure below 10 mm Hg, and moderate hypothermia (32 degrees C rectal temperature). We correlated the measured concentrations of S-100 protein in CSF with the results of evoked potential monitoring during surgery and the number of intercostals reimplanted and oversewn.\nIn all the patients, the concentration of S-100 protein was increased in CSF. The highest concentration of S-100 protein was found in the CSF sample taken 5 minutes after reperfusion of the critical aortic segment. There was a good (negative) correlation between the changes in S-100 protein in CSF and the changes in motor evoked potential monitoring during the cross-clamp period. The best (negative) correlation was detected between the S-100 protein elevation in the CSF sample drawn 5 minutes after reperfusion and the tcMEP amplitude reduction during clamping (r = -0.73; P =.007). No relation was found between the S-100 protein dynamics in CSF and somatosensory evoked potential monitoring. A positive (r = 0.58; P =.05) correlation was found between the change in tcMEP amplitude during clamping and the number of reattached intercostals. A moderate to good (r = -0.5 to -0.7; P <.05) correlation between the number of reattached intercostals and the changes in S-100 protein concentration in CSF during TAAA surgery was found. Our data show that transient elevations in S-100 protein after cross clamping are larger in those patients with marked decrease in tcMEP from baseline during the cross-clamp period.\nA correlation is shown between an increasing concentration of S-100 protein in CSF and a reduction in tcMEP amplitude during cross clamping of the aorta. The S-100 protein in CSF seems to be a marker of potential clinical value in the evaluation of the effects of procedures to detect and reduce spinal cord ischemia.",

    "abstract": "The primary objective of this study was to evaluate with venography the rate of thrombus regression after a fixed dose of low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) per day for 3 months compared with oral anticoagulant therapy for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Secondary endpoints were the comparisons of the efficacy and safety of both treatments.\nThis study was designed as an open randomized clinical study in a university hospital setting. Of the 165 patients finally enrolled in the study, 85 were assigned LMWH therapy and 80 were assigned oral anticoagulant therapy. In the group randomized to oral anticoagulant therapy, the patients first underwent treatment in the hospital with standard unfractionated heparin and then coumarin for 3 months. Doses were adjusted with laboratory monitoring to maintain the international normalized ratio between 2.0 and 3.0. Patients in the LMWH group were administered subcutaneous injections of fixed doses of 40 mg enoxaparin (4000 anti-Xa units) every 12 hours for 7 days, and after discharge from the hospital, they were administered 40 mg enoxaparin once daily at fixed doses for 3 months without a laboratory control assay. A quantitative venographic score (Marder score) was used to assess the extent of the venous thrombosis, with 0 points indicating no DVT and 40 points indicating total occlusion of all deep veins. The rate of thrombus reduction was defined as the difference in quantitative venographic scores after termination of LMWH or coumarin therapy as compared with the scores obtained on the initial venographic results. The efficacy was defined as the ability to prevent symptomatic extension or recurrence of venous thromboembolism (documented with venograms or serial lung scans). The safety was defined as the occurrence of hemorrhages.\nAfter 3 months of treatment, the mean Marder score was significantly decreased in both groups in comparison with the baseline score, although the effect of therapy was significantly better after LMWH therapy (49.4% reduction) than after coumarin therapy (24.5% reduction; P <.001). LMWH therapy and male gender were independently associated with an enhanced resolution of the thrombus. A lower frequency of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism was also shown in patients who underwent treatment with LMWH therapy (9.5%) than with oral anticoagulant therapy (23.7%; P <.05), although this difference was entirely a result of recurrence of DVT. Bleeding complications were significantly fewer in the LMWH group than in the coumarin group (1. 1% vs 10%; P <.05). This difference was caused by minor hemorrhages. Coumarin therapy and cancer were independently associated with an enhanced risk of complications. Subcutaneous heparin therapy was well tolerated by all patients.\nThe patients who were allocated to undergo enoxaparin therapy had a significantly greater improvement in their quantitative venographic score, a significantly lower recurrence rate of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, and a significantly lower incidence of bleeding than patients who underwent treatment with coumarin. LMWH can be used on an outpatient basis as a safer and more effective alternative to classical oral anticoagulant therapy for the secondary prophylaxis of selected patients with DVT.",

The duck HBV (DHBV) has similar biologic and structural characteristics to HBV and has been adopted as a suitable model for disinfectant testing.\nAngioscopic examination of the external jugular vein was performed on DHBV-infected ducks. After use, the instrument was air dried for 3 minutes. Samples were obtained by flushing the channel with 5 mL of phosphate buffered saline solution. The samples were collected immediately after drying (control), after flushing with 5 mL of water, after glutaraldehyde disinfection for 5, 10, and 20 minutes, and after ethylene oxide gas sterilization. Angioscopes were either precleaned or uncleaned before disinfection/sterilization. Residual infectivity was assessed with inoculation of samples into the peritoneal cavity of day-old ducks (n = 231).\nDNA analysis results of liver samples showed that all 38 control ducks became infected. The frequency of DHBV infection was reduced to 93% (14 of 15) by flushing the angioscope with 5 mL of sterile water. No transmission occurred after the use of any of the properly precleaned and disinfected/sterilized angioscopes. However, after the use of the uncleaned angioscopes, the transmission rate was 90% (9 of 10) and 70% (7 of 10) after 5 and 10 minutes of contact time, respectively, in 2% glutaraldehyde. Even after the recommended 20 minutes of contact time, there was still 6% (2 of 35) transmission. After ethylene oxide sterilization, two of the recipient ducklings (2 of 35) were infected with DHBV.\nThere was no disease transmission after reuse of disposable angioscopes adequately cleaned before disinfection or sterilization. However, if the angioscopes are inadequately cleaned, DHBV can survive despite glutaraldehyde disinfection or ethylene oxide sterilization. This contrasts with previous in vitro and in vivo data with solid surgical instruments. It is postulated that the presence of a narrow lumen or residual protein shielding within the lumen may compromise effective inactivation of hepadnaviruses on angioscopes, with the potential risk for patient-to-patient transmission.",

These features of the lesion could be influenced by the fragility and position of neovessels within the plaque. The purpose of this study was to determine whether any association exists between neovessel density, position, morphology, and thromboembolic sequelae.\nCarotid endarterectomy samples were collected from 15 asymptomatic patients with greater than 80% stenoses and from 13 highly symptomatic patients who had suffered ipsilateral carotid stenotic events within 1 month of surgery. Both groups were matched for gender, age, risk factors, degree of carotid artery stenosis, and plaque size. Samples were stained with hematoxylin/eosin and van Geison. Immunohistochemistry was performed by using an endothelial specific antibody to CD31. Plaques were assessed for histologic characteristics, and neovessels were counted and characterized by size, site, and shape.\nThere were significantly more neovessels in plaques (P <.00001) and fibrous caps (P <.0001) in symptomatic compared with asymptomatic plaques. Neovessels in symptomatic plaques were larger (P <.004) and more irregular. There was a significant increase in plaque necrosis and rupture in symptomatic plaques. Plaque hemorrhage and rupture were associated with more neovessels within the plaque (P <.017, P <.001) and within the fibrous cap (P <.046, P <.004). Patients with preoperative and intraoperative embolization had significantly more plaque and fibrous cap neovessels (P <.025, P <.001).\nSymptomatic carotid disease is associated with increased neovascularization within the atherosclerotic plaque and fibrous cap. These vessels are larger and more irregular and may contribute to plaque instability and the onset of thromboembolic sequelae.",

    "abstract": "The hemodynamic effect of stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) can be assessed by measuring, with transcranial Doppler (TCD), the carbon dioxide (CO(2)) reactivity of the cerebral vessels. The aim of this study was to determine whether a decreased CO(2) reactivity is associated with a compromised cerebral metabolism, as evaluated with (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).\nSixty-six patients with unilateral or bilateral stenosis of the ICA, who were scheduled for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and who had undergone both a TCD CO(2) reactivity test and a MRS examination, were included in this study. The ICA stenosis on one side (CEA side) was always more than 70%, and the extent of the stenosis on the contralateral side varied.\nThe CO(2) reactivity and the N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/choline ratio were correlated in both hemispheres (r =.43; P <.001). Patients with an ICA occlusion contralateral to the CEA side are especially at risk for disordered cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism; in the contralateral hemisphere, the mean CO(2) reactivity and NAA/choline ratio were abnormal (18% and 1.52, respectively), and lactate was present in 85% of the patients. Changes indicative of disordered hemodynamics were found more often in symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients.\nA decreased CO(2) reactivity appears to be associated with a disordered cerebral metabolism. Patients with severe bilateral ICA stenosis are at risk for disordered cerebral metabolism and hemodynamics. Therefore, the indication for CEA based on the degree of ICA stenosis and clinical grounds might be refined with an additional test, such as the TCD CO(2) reactivity test.",

The study consisted of 40 patients who underwent operation for ruptured AAA and 10 patients who underwent operation for non-ruptured AAA. The main outcome measures were serum total and pancreatic and salivary amylase activities determined with enzymatic colorimetric assay before operation and 6 hours after aortic clamp release.\nFive of 40 patients (12.5%) with rupture and one of 10 patients (10%) with non-rupture had elevated total amylase levels before operation, and seven of 31 patients (23%) with rupture and five of 10 patients (50%) with non-rupture had elevated total amylase levels after operation. The preoperative salivary amylase (P =.05) and postoperative pancreatic amylase (P <.02) levels were significantly lower in ruptured AAA as compared with non-ruptured AAA. The preoperative salivary amylase level was significantly lower in non-survivors of rupture, such that a level equal to or less than 45 U/L was associated with death in 11 of 13 patients (85%).\nThese data do not support previous works that suggest that hyperamylasemia is associated with poor outcome in ruptured AAA. By contrast, a low preoperative salivary amylase level was associated with increased mortality in ruptured AAA and may be a marker of the severity of shock.",

    "abstract": "Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA) remains a lethal condition despite improvements in perioperative care. The consequences of RAAA are hypothesized to result from a combination of two ischemia/reperfusion events: hemorrhagic shock and lower torso ischemia. Ischemia/reperfusion results in tissue injury by diverse mechanisms, which include oxygen free radical-mediated injury produced from activated neutrophils, xanthine oxidase, and mitochondria. Oxygen-free radicals attack membrane lipids, resulting in membrane and subsequently cellular dysfunction that contributes to postoperative organ injury/failure. The purpose of this investigation was to quantify the oxidative injury that occurs as a result of the ischemia/reperfusion events in RAAAs and elective AAAs.\nBlood samples were taken from 22 patients for elective AAA repair and from 14 patients for RAAA repair during the perioperative period. Plasma F(2)-isoprostanes were extracted, purified, and measured with an enzyme immunoassay. Aldehydes and acyloins were purified and quantified. Neutrophil oxidative burst was measured in response to a receptor independent stimulus (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) with luminol-based chemiluminescence.\nPlasma from patients with RAAAs showed significantly elevated F(2)-isoprostane levels on arrival at hospital and were significantly elevated as compared with the levels of patients for elective repair throughout the perioperative period (two-way analysis of variance, P <.0001). Multiple regression showed a significant relationship between the phagocyte oxidative activity and F(2)-isoprostane levels (P <.013). Total acyloin levels were significantly higher in patients with RAAAs as compared with the levels in elective cases.\nThe F(2)-isoprostane levels, specific markers of lipid peroxidation, showed that patients with RAAAs had two phases of oxidative injury: before arrival at hospital and after surgery. The significant relationship between the postoperative increases in F(2)-isoprostane levels and the neutrophil oxidant production implicates neutrophils in the oxidative injury that occurs after RAAA. New therapeutic interventions that attenuate neutrophil-mediated oxidant injury during reperfusion may decrease organ failure and ultimately mortality in patients with RAAAs.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the results of the bifurcated Vanguard endovascular graft for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.\nSeventy-five patients, with a median age of 69.6 years (range, 48 to 88 years) and asymptomatic AAAs, were recruited in 14 French vascular institutions. An independent committee validated the indications for endovascular repair, and all the implantations were supervised by a well-trained medico-technical assistant. Further independent committees reviewed patient data, clinical data, and imaging follow-up examination. The main endpoints were implantation success, mortality, morbidity, reinterventions, and aneurysm evolution assessed with serial computed tomographic (CT) scanning.\nAll the grafts were successfully implanted, resulting in a 100% success rate on an intent-to-treat basis. At discharge, there were no deaths, six significant local complications (8%) that necessitated surgery, no vascular complications, and six systemic complications (8%). The average durations of intensive care unit and hospital stays were 26 +/- 6 hours and 6 +/- 2.54 days, respectively. Predischarge CT scan results showed five type I and 18 type II endoleaks (total, 30%). At the end of the follow-up period (mean duration, 18.35 +/- 4.12 months; range, 17 days to 24 months), seven patients (9%) had died: one from sepsis, five from unrelated causes, and one from aneurysm rupture. The 2-year cumulative survival rate was 86% +/- 5.9%. Twenty-one subsequent endovascular or vascular procedures were necessitated (28%) in 17 patients (23%) to treat graft limb occlusion or stenosis (n = 9 patients) or to seal an endoleak (n = 8 patients). The 2-year cumulative survival rate free of reintervention was 67% +/- 7%. On CT scans, the mean AAA diameter decreased from 54 mm +/- 8.9 (range, 45 to 80 mm) before surgery to 51.6 mm +/- 9.1 at 6 months and to 43.4 mm +/- 4.4 at the end of the follow-up period (P =.001). Persistent endoleak was significantly associated with an increase in diameter (4 of 5 [80%] vs 1 of 47 [2%]; P =.001).\nIn selected patients, the bifurcated Vanguard endovascular graft may be implanted with a low mortality and morbidity rate and a favorable mid-term survival rate. The decrease of the aneurysm size is a strong argument in favor of the efficiency of the device. However, lasting endoleaks with increased aneurysm diameter and occurrence of limb graft stenosis or occlusion raise concerns and justify a careful long-term follow-up monitoring of all patients who undergo treatment with endovascular technique.",

Because of the presence of the visceral artery aneurysms and the earlier operation through the retroperitoneum, standard surgical treatment via a retroperitoneal approach with an inclusion grafting technique was considered difficult. A combined surgical approach achieving retrograde perfusion of all four visceral vessels and endovascular grafting allowing exclusion of the TAA was accomplished. Complete exclusion of the aneurysm and normal perfusion of the patient's viscera was documented by means of follow-up examinations at 3 and 6 months. The repair of a type IV TAA with a Combined Endovascular and Surgical Approach (CESA) allowed us to manage both the aortic and visceral aneurysms without thoracotomy or re-do retroperitoneal exposure and minimized visceral ischemia time. If the durability of this approach is confirmed, it may represent an attractive alternative in patients with aneurysmal involvement of the visceral segment of the aorta.",

    "abstract": "In an attempt to study whether ischemic spinal cord expresses a foreign gene in vivo, a replication-defective adenoviral vector containing the Escherichia coli lacZ gene was directly injected into the ischemic spinal cord of rabbits, and temporal and spatial profiles of the exogenous gene expression were compared with that of the control spinal cord.\nThirty-nine Japanese domesticated white rabbits weighing 2 to 3 kg were used in this study and were divided into two subgroups, a 15-minute ischemia group and a sham control group. The adenoviral vector was directly injected into lumbar spinal cord by a needle from dorsal spine just after the infrarenal aortic occlusion in the case of ischemia. Animals were allowed to recover at ambient temperature and were killed at 1, 2, 4, and 7 days after reperfusion (n = 3 at each time point).\nIn the control rabbit, adenoviral vector was transferred into the spinal cord, and the lacZ gene was expressed at dorsal astroglia and anterior motor neurons at 1 to 7 days of reperfusion. After 15 minutes of ischemia, the lacZ gene was expressed at 2 and 4 days of reperfusion in dorsal astroglia and anterior motor neurons, which were positive for Fas antigen.\nThis result suggests that it is possible to transfer and express the lacZ gene in ischemic motor neurons, which eventually show apoptotic change with induction of Fas antigen, and also suggests a great potential of gene therapy for paraplegic patients in the future.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic dysfunction may contribute to death from multiple organ dysfunction after abdominal aortic surgery. Several factors are likely responsible, and the purpose of this study was to determine whether the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1 (IL-1) are involved in initiating this remote hepatic injury.\nIn a normotensive rat model of 4-hour bilateral hindlimb ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), we measured systemic TNF-alpha and IL-1 levels throughout the I/R period. Rats were randomly assigned to either the 3-hour control group, the 3-hour I/R group, or the I/R group with administration of a polyclonal antibody (PAb) to TNF-alpha (I/R + TNF-alpha PAb). Direct evidence of lethal hepatocyte injury through the labeling of nuclei by propidium iodide (per 10(-1)mm(3)) and altered microvascular perfusion were assessed by using intravital microscopy.\nSystemic TNF-alpha peaked at 83.97 pg/mL (P <.05, n = 5) at 30 minutes of reperfusion and returned to baseline in 60 to 90 minutes. No significant change in systemic IL-1 was detected (P <.05, n = 4). Alanine aminotransferase increased 2.5-fold in the I/R group through 3 hours of reperfusion (P <.05, n = 4), and TNF-alpha PAb did not attenuate this alanine aminotransferase increase (P <.05, n = 6). Lethal hepatocyte injury increased by 8-fold in the I/R group compared with the control group (P <.05, n = 5), whereas TNF-alpha PAb significantly reduced this injury (P <.05, n = 4). No regional differences in injury were noted within the acinus. Total perfusion within the microvascular unit did not drop; however, significant flow heterogeneity was observed. The proportion of continuously perfused sinusoids declined in the I/R group after 3 hours of reperfusion in both periportal (62.0 +/- 2.2, P <.05) and, to a lesser, although significant, degree, in the pericentral regions (73. 2 +/- 1.73, P <.05).\nBy scavenging extracellular TNF-alpha with a PAb, we provide direct evidence that TNF-alpha contributes to, but is not solely responsible for, early remote hepatocellular injury and microvascular dysfunction. The administration of TNF-alpha PAb reduced lethal hepatocyte injury in both regions of the acinus and also improved perfusion in the periportal region (76.8 +/- 5.41, P <.05), but not in the pericentral region. This suggests that TNF-alpha released during reperfusion mediates early remote hepatocellular injury and microvascular dysfunction after a remote ischemic insult.",

The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate oral LMWH with SNAD for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis.\nSixty Sprague-Dawley rats were equally assigned to five experimental groups: group 1 (control), oral saline solution; group 2, oral LMWH (15 mg/kg); group 3, oral SNAD (300 mg/kg); group 4, subcutaneous LMWH (5 mg/kg); and group 5, oral LMWH (15 mg/kg) and SNAD (300 mg/kg). After treatment, the jugular vein was isolated, occluded, and bathed in an ethanol and formalin solution for 2 minutes. Two hours later, the vessel was examined for patency, presence of thrombus, and thrombus weight. Serum measurement of anti-factor Xa activity was performed in a separate set of 30 rats, which were placed into the following four groups: group A, LMWH (5 mg/kg); group B, oral LMWH (15 mg/kg) and SNAD (300 mg/kg); group C, oral LMWH (15 mg/kg); and group D, SNAD (300 mg/kg).\nThe animals that underwent oral LMWH/SNAD therapy had a statistically significant decrease in visible thrombi. The thrombus weight of the oral LMWH/SNAD group was significantly less than the weights of all other groups, except the subcutaneous LMWH group. Anti-factor Xa levels were significantly elevated in the LMWH/SNAD group. There was no statistically significant difference between the data for the oral LMWH/SNAD group and the subcutaneous LMWH group.\nThe combination of oral LMWH and SNAD prevented deep venous thrombosis. The oral LMWH and SNAD therapy effected an increase in levels of anti-factor Xa.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS) in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and characteristics that are associated with ICAS were studied.\nWe used data from the first 600 patients enrolled in the Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) study, a single-center, prospective cohort study among patients referred with a manifestation of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. Included in the analysis were 162 patients with PAD or a history of PAD, who were not known to have ICAS at the time of referral and who had no history of cerebrovascular symptoms or previous carotid endarterectomy. ICAS was detected with duplex scanning and defined as a peak systolic velocity more than 150 cm/s (diameter reduction 50% or higher) on at least one side. Cardiovascular risk factors were measured. Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate associations between these characteristics and ICAS.\nThe prevalence of previously unknown ICAS was 14%. A patient age of 67 years or older, body weight of 68 kg or less, and diastolic blood pressure of 75 mm Hg or lower were independently associated with ICAS. The Prevalence Of Icas In Patients With One Of These Characteristics (38% Of The Patients) Was 8%, In Those With Two Characteristics (21% Of The Patients) Was 32%, And In Those With Three Characteristics (6% Of The Patients) Was 50%.\nThe prevalence of ICAS increases as much as 50% in patients who have PAD and the risk indicators of an age of 67 years or older, a body weight of 68 kg or less, and a diastolic blood pressure of 75 mm Hg or lower, and, therefore, these characteristics may be used as a means of increasing the likelihood of detecting ICAS.",

    "abstract": "The intermediate success and outcome of primary forefoot amputations in patients with diabetes mellitus who have sepsis limited to the forefoot and presumed adequate forefoot perfusion, as determined by means of noninvasive methods, was studied.\nCases of a university hospital-based practice from January 1984 to April 1998 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients included had diabetes mellitus with forefoot sepsis requiring immediate hospitalization for digit amputations who had adequate arterial circulation for healing based on noninvasive and clinical assessment: palpable pedal pulses (29%), \"compressible\" ankle pressure of 70 mm Hg or higher (48%), pulsatile metatarsal waveforms (67%), and/or toe pressure higher than 55 mm Hg (36%). All patients underwent a primary single- or multiple-digit amputation (through the interphalangeal joint, metatarsal head, or metatarsal shaft). Additional forefoot procedures (debridement, digit amputation) were performed during the follow-up period as needed for persistent or recurrent infection. The main outcome variables were recurrent or persistent foot infection (defined as requiring rehospitalization for antibiotics, wound care, and/or reoperation), the number of repeat operations and hospitalizations for salvage of limbs with recurrent or persistent infections, and time to complete forefoot healing or foot amputation.\nNinety-two patients who had diabetes mellitus with 97 forefoot infections comprised the study group. Ninety-seven primary digit amputations (34 through interphalangeal joints, 28 through metatarsal heads, 35 through metatarsal shafts) were performed. The median length of hospital stay was 10 days. There were no operative deaths. The mean follow-up period was 21 months (range, 3 days to 105 months). The primary amputation healed (without persistent infection) in only 38 limbs (39%), at a mean time of 13 +/- 10 weeks. Twenty-three limbs (24%) had not healed the primary amputation without evidence of persistent infection at last follow-up (mean, 12 weeks). Infection persisted in 35 limbs (36%), and infection recurred in 15 of 38 (40%) healed limbs. An average of 1.0 reoperations (range, 0 to 3) and 1.6 rehospitalizations (range, 1 to 4) were involved in salvage attempts in these recurrent/persistent infections. Five persistent and five recurrent infections ultimately healed (mean, 53 weeks). Complete healing was achieved in only 33 of 97 limbs (34%). Twenty-two foot amputations (20 transtibial, two Syme's) were performed (mean, 49 +/- 74 weeks; 20 for persistent infection). Eighteen persistent/recurrent infections remained unhealed at the last follow-up examination (mean, 105 weeks).\nPatients with diabetes mellitus who have sepsis limited to the forefoot requiring acute hospitalization and undergoing primary digit amputations have a high incidence of intermediate-term, persistent, and recurrent infection, leading to a modest rate of limb loss, despite having apparently salvageable lesions and noninvasive evidence of presumed adequate forefoot perfusion.",

    "abstract": "Although pedal artery bypass has been established as an effective and durable limb salvage procedure, the utility of these bypass grafts in limb salvage, specifically for the difficult problem of heel ulceration, remains undefined.\nWe retrospectively reviewed 432 pedal bypass grafts placed for indications of ischemic gangrene or ulceration isolated to either the forefoot (n = 336) or heel (n = 96). Lesion-healing rates and life-table analysis of survival, patency, and limb salvage were compared for forefoot versus heel lesions. Preoperative angiograms were reviewed to evaluate the influence of an intact pedal arch on heel lesion healing.\nComplete healing rates for forefoot and heel lesions were similar (90.5% vs 86.5%, P =.26), with comparable rates of major lower extremity amputation (9.8% vs 9.3%, P =.87). Time to complete healing in the heel lesion group ranged from 13 to 716 days, with a mean of 139 days. Preoperative angiography demonstrated an intact pedal arch in 48.8% of the patients with heel lesions. Healing and graft patency rates in these patients with heel lesions were independent of the presence of an intact arch, with healing rates of 90.2% and 83.7% (P =.38) and 2-year patency rates of 73.4% and 67.0% in complete and incomplete pedal arches, respectively. Comparison of 5-year primary and secondary patency rates between the forefoot and heel lesion groups were essentially identical, with primary rates of 56.9% versus 62.1% (P =.57) and secondary rates of 67.2% versus 60.3% (P =.50), respectively.\nBypass grafts to the dorsalis pedis artery provide substantial perfusion to the posterior foot such that the resulting limb salvage and healing rates for revascularized heel lesions is excellent and comparable with those observed for ischemic forefoot pathology.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of prophylactic inferior vena cava filters in selected trauma patients at high risk has come into question in relation to risk/benefit assessment. To evaluate the usefulness of prophylactic inferior vena cava filters, we reviewed our experience and overall complication rate.\nFrom February 1991 to April 1998, the trauma registry identified 7333 admissions. One hundred eighty-seven prophylactic inferior vena cava filters were inserted. After the exclusion of 27 trauma-related deaths (none caused by thromboembolism), 160 patients were eligible for the study. The eligible patients were contacted and asked to complete a survey and return for a follow-up examination to include physical examination, Doppler scan study, vena cava duplex scanning, and fluoroscopic examination. The patients' hospital charts were reviewed in detail. The indications for prophylactic inferior vena cava filter insertion included prolonged immobilization with multiple injuries, closed head injury, pelvic fracture, spine fracture, multiple long bone fracture, and attending discretion.\nOf the 160 eligible patients, 127 were men, the mean age was 40.3 years, and the mean injury severity score was 26.1. The mean day of insertion was hospital day 6. Seventy-five patients (47%) returned for evaluation, with a mean follow-up period of 19.4 months after implantation (range, 7 to 60 months). On survey, patients had leg swelling (n = 27), lower extremity numbness (n = 14), shortness of breath (n = 9), chest pain (n = 7), and skin changes (n = 4). All the survey symptoms appeared to be attributable to patient injuries and not related to prophylactic inferior vena cava filter. Physical examination results revealed edema (n = 12) and skin changes (n = 2). Ten Doppler scan studies had results that were suggestive of venous insufficiency, nine of which had histories of deep vein thrombosis. With duplex scanning, 93% (70 of 75) of the vena cavas were visualized, and all were patent. Only 52% (39 of 75) of the prophylactic inferior vena cava filters were visualized with duplex scanning. All the prophylactic inferior vena cava filters were visualized with fluoroscopy, with no evidence of filter migration. Of the total 187 patients, 24 (12.8%) had deep vein thrombosis develop after prophylactic inferior vena cava filter insertion, including 10 of 75 (13.3%) in the follow-up group, and one patient had a nonfatal pulmonary embolism despite filter placement. Filter insertion complications occurred in 1.6% (three of 187) of patients and included one groin hematoma, one arteriovenous fistula, and one misplacement in the common iliac vein.\nThis study's results show that prophylactic inferior vena cava filters can be placed safely with low morbidity and no attributable long-term disabilities. In this patient population with a high risk of pulmonary embolism, prophylactic inferior vena cava filters offered a 99.5% protection rate, with only one of 187 patients having a nonfatal pulmonary embolism.",

    "results": "Of the 160 eligible patients, 127 were men, the mean age was 40.3 years, and the mean injury severity score was 26.1. The mean day of insertion was hospital day 6. Seventy-five patients (47%) returned for evaluation, with a mean follow-up period of 19.4 months after implantation (range, 7 to 60 months). On survey, patients had leg swelling (n = 27), lower extremity numbness (n = 14), shortness of breath (n = 9), chest pain (n = 7), and skin changes (n = 4). All the survey symptoms appeared to be attributable to patient injuries and not related to prophylactic inferior vena cava filter. Physical examination results revealed edema (n = 12) and skin changes (n = 2). Ten Doppler scan studies had results that were suggestive of venous insufficiency, nine of which had histories of deep vein thrombosis. With duplex scanning, 93% (70 of 75) of the vena cavas were visualized, and all were patent. Only 52% (39 of 75) of the prophylactic inferior vena cava filters were visualized with duplex scanning. All the prophylactic inferior vena cava filters were visualized with fluoroscopy, with no evidence of filter migration. Of the total 187 patients, 24 (12.8%) had deep vein thrombosis develop after prophylactic inferior vena cava filter insertion, including 10 of 75 (13.3%) in the follow-up group, and one patient had a nonfatal pulmonary embolism despite filter placement. Filter insertion complications occurred in 1.6% (three of 187) of patients and included one groin hematoma, one arteriovenous fistula, and one misplacement in the common iliac vein.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective review describes the surgical management of 51 patients after failed percutaneous renal artery angioplasty (F-PTRA).\nFrom January 1987 through June 1998, 51 consecutive patients underwent surgical repair of either atherosclerotic (32 patients) or fibromuscular dysplastic (FMD; 19 patients) renovascular vascular disease after F-PTRA. These patients form the basis of this report. Surgical repair was performed for hypertension (29 patients with atherosclerosis: mean blood pressure, 205 +/- 34/110 +/- 23 mm Hg; 18 patients with FMD: mean blood pressure, 194 +/- 24/118 +/- 18 mm Hg) or ischemic nephropathy (20 patients with atherosclerosis: mean serum creatinine level, 2.0 +/- 0.8 mg/dL; three patients with FMD: mean serum creatinine level, 2.0 +/- 1.1 mg/dL). Emergency operation was required in four patients for acute renal artery thrombosis (one patient with atherosclerosis, one patient with FMD), renal artery rupture (one patient with atherosclerosis), or infected pseudoaneurysm (one patient with atherosclerosis). Operative management, blood pressure and renal function response to operation, and dialysis-free survival rate were examined and compared with 487 patients (441 patients with atherosclerosis, 46 patients with FMD) treated by operation alone.\nAmong the patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease, there were three postoperative deaths (9.4%) after repair for F-PTRA. Secondary operative repair was associated with emergent repair or nephrectomy in 16% of cases, while more extensive renal artery exposure and more complex operative management was required in 50% of patients with atherosclerosis and 65% of patients with FMD repaired electively. Among the 28 operative survivors with hypertension and atherosclerotic renovascular disease, blood pressure benefit after F-PTRA was significantly lower when compared with patients with atherosclerosis who underwent treatment with operation only (57% vs 89%; P <.001). However, blood pressure benefit in the 19 patients with FMD did not differ (89% vs 96%). Among the 28 patients with atherosclerosis, preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR) as compared with postoperative EGFR was significantly increased (47.4 +/- 4.2 mL/min/1.73m(2) vs 56. 6 +/- 5.1 mL/min/1.73m(2); P =.002). However, EGFR prior to PTRA was not significantly different from postoperative EGFR (51.6 +/- 3.4 mL/min/1.73m(2) vs 56.6 +/- 4.9 mL/min/1.73m(2); P =.121). As compared with patients with atherosclerosis who underwent treatment with operation alone, there was no difference in the dialysis-free survival rate.\nOperative repair after F-PTRA was altered in 59% of the patients with atherosclerosis and in 68% of patients with FMD. Blood pressure benefit for patients with FMD was unchanged after F-PTRA. However, the blood pressure benefit was significantly decreased among patients with atherosclerosis. Decreased EGFR after F-PTRA was recovered with operative renal artery repair. However, postoperative EGFR as compared with EGFR prior to PTRA was unchanged. Blood pressure and renal function response after F-PTRA for atherosclerotic renovascular disease warrants further study.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of solvent-detergent-treated fibrin sealant (human [FSH]) for controlling anastomotic bleeding from expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) patch angioplasty during carotid endarterectomy was evaluated, and FSH was compared with thrombin-soaked gelatin sponge (Gelfoam; TSG).\nThe study was of a randomized, open-label, single-site, single-treatment, parallel design that took place in a referral center with hospitalized patients. Forty-seven adult patients (33 men, 14 women) underwent elective carotid endarterectomy. Patients were randomized to receive either FSH (N = 24) or TSG (N = 23). FSH was obtained as an investigational new drug. FSH was applied as a liquid by means of a dual-syringe technique. Heparin anticoagulation, patch thickness, and suture type were standardized. Two different needle sizes were used (CV-6, PT-13: N = 21 [FSH: N = 10, TSG: N = 11]; CV-6, PT-9: N = 26 [FSH: N = 14, TSG: N = 13]). The FSH or TSG was applied to the ePTFE patch, and then blood flow was restored through the carotid artery. Degree of anticoagulation was assessed by anti-factor Xa activity. The time from restoration of carotid blood flow until achieving hemostasis was recorded. The blood loss from patch suture hole bleeding was measured. Completion intraoperative duplex ultrasound scanning was performed in all cases. Heparin was reversed with protamine sulfate. The primary end point was successful hemostasis within 15 minutes of restoration of carotid blood flow. The secondary end points were the amount of blood loss caused by suture line bleeding and the time to achieve hemostasis.\nThere was no difference in the number of patients with complete hemostasis at 15 minutes (TSG, 13 of 23; FSH, 12 of 24; P =.77). The measured blood loss was 99.0 +/- 119.9 (SD) mL for TSG, and 105.0 +/- 107.9 mL for FSH (P =.86). The time to hemostasis was the same for both groups (TSG, 16.5 +/- 16.5 minutes; FSH, 16.6 +/- 14.2 minutes; P =.97). Within both treatment groups, the use of larger needles (PT-13) was associated with greater blood loss (FSH, 169.7 +/- 124.2 mL; TSG, 172.7 +/- 151.5 mL) than was the use of smaller needles (PT-9; FSH, 58.8 +/- 66.3 mL; TSG, 34.1 +/- 25.6 mL; P =.036, P =.001, respectively). There were no postoperative strokes or bleeding complications in either group. No abnormalities were shown in either group by means of completion carotid duplex ultrasound scanning.\nFSH was equivalent, but not superior to, TSG in achieving hemostasis during carotid endarterectomy performed with ePTFE patch angioplasty. Adhesion properties of FSH to ePTFE are possibly different than those to native tissue and warrant additional investigation.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine the appropriate timing and frequency of duplex ultrasound scanning after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for the detection of high-grade stenosis caused by recurrent carotid stenosis or contralateral atherosclerotic disease progression.\nIn 221 patients who underwent 242 CEAs, duplex scanning was performed before, during, and after operation (in 3-month to 6-month intervals). High-grade internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis (peak systolic velocity, >300 cm/s; diastolic velocity, >125 cm/s; ICA/common carotid artery ratio, >4) prompted the recommendation for repair. An average of four postoperative scanning procedures was performed during a mean follow-up period of 27.4 months.\nIntraoperative duplex scan results prompted the immediate revision of 12 repairs (4.9%), and one perioperative stroke (<1%) occurred. Six CEAs (2.7%) had asymptomatic recurrent stenosis (>50% diameter-reduction [DR]; systolic velocity, >125 cm/s) develop. Only one of six patients had >75% DR stenosis develop and underwent reoperation (<1% yield for CEA surveillance). The yield of surveillance of the unoperated ICA was higher (P =.003), and 12% of unoperated sides had progressive stenosis (n = 21) or occlusion (n = 3) develop, which led to seven CEAs for high-grade stenosis. Disease progression to >75% DR stenosis was five times as frequent (P =.002) in patients with >50% DR stenosis initially. All patients but one who required contralateral endarterectomy for disease progression had >50% ICA stenosis when first seen. During the follow-up period, no disabling strokes ipsilateral to an operated carotid artery occurred, but three strokes occurred in the hemisphere of the contralateral unoperated ICA.\nThe yield of duplex scan surveillance after CEA was low. Only 13 patients (5.9%) had severe disease develop to warrant additional intervention. Progression of contralateral disease rather than restenosis was the most common abnormality that was identified. Duplex scanning at 1-year to 2-year intervals after CEA is adequate when a technically precise repair is achieved and minimal contralateral disease (<50% DR) is present. A policy of duplex scan surveillance and reoperation for high-grade stenosis was associated with a 1.6% incidence rate of disabling stroke during the follow-up period.",

These patients were then examined with serial scans. Subsequent redo endarterectomy and neurological events were recorded.\nPatients were observed for 9 to 84 months (mean, 53 months). Arteries with recurrent stenosis were grouped according to the maximal velocity recorded: group I, systolic velocity more than 125 cm/s and less than 280 cm/s (12); group II, systolic velocity more than 280 cm/s or diastolic velocity more than 80 cm/s (21); group III, systolic velocity more than 280 cm/s and diastolic velocity more than 120 cm/s (14); group IV, internal carotid artery occlusion (2). The mean time to a velocity of more than 125 cm/s was 11 months. The mean time to peak velocity was 16 months. During The Follow-UP Period, Five Stenoses Remained Stable. Nineteen Continued To Increase, With Two Eventual Asymptomatic Occlusions (4%). Six Recurrences Ultimately Had Redo Endarterectomy, Two For Symptoms. Three Of These Developed New Secondary Recurrent Lesions. However, In 25 Arteries (53%), The Velocity Profile Decreased By At Least One Group Classification. The Mean Time To The Lowest Velocity (TTL) Was 50 Months. Systolic Velocity Ultimately Fell Below 125 Cm/S In 13 Stenoses (SIX In Group I; Five In Group II; Two In Group III).\nEarly recurrent hemodynamically significant stenosis is unusual and rarely progresses to occlusion. Even critical stenosis can regress to within normal limits. Redo endarterectomy is seldom necessary. The challenge remains to define which patients are at risk for symptoms and occlusion.",

    "abstract": "The onset of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease at a young age (premature PAD) has been associated with rapid progression, bypass graft failure, and amputation. This study was performed to document the incidence of these complications and to determine the risk factors for poor outcome in patients with premature PAD.\nThis study was designed as a prospective longitudinal analysis, with patients who were ambulatory or hospitalized at a single vascular referral institution. The subjects were 51 white men with onset of PAD symptoms before the age of 45 years (mean age of onset, 41 +/- 0.5 years) and represented consecutive patients who were seen at the vascular surgery service during a 4-year period. Thirty of the study subjects (58%) were recruited during the first 2 years. The main outcome measures were number and type of lower extremity revascularization procedures or amputations that were necessitated during the follow-up period.\nDuring a mean follow-up period of 73 +/- 6 months, 15 patients (29%) had PAD that remained stable without interventions and 15 (29%) had PAD that remained stable for a mean of 76 +/- 13 months after a single intervention. Twenty-one patients (41%) required multiple operations or major amputations. In a comparison of the 30 PAD patients whose conditions were stable with or without a single intervention with the 21 PAD patients who required multiple interventions (REDO), there were no differences in smoking, hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemias. The REDO group had a younger mean age at the onset of symptoms (39 +/- 1 years vs 43 +/- 2 years; P <.001). At entry, the REDO patients had a higher prevalence of infrainguinal or multilevel disease (57% vs 20%; P =.03), a lower mean ankle brachial index (0. 44 +/- 0.04 vs 0.56 +/- 0.03; P =.02), and more frequent tissue loss (24% vs 0; P =.005). The REDO patients had a higher mean lipoprotein (a) level than did the patients with stable conditions (51 +/- 11 mg/dL vs 27 +/- 5 mg/dL; P =.03), but there were no significant differences in the mean plasma homocysteine levels (19 +/- 2 micromol/L vs 16 +/- 1 micromol/L) or in the proportion of patients with hypercoagulable states (33% vs 30%). The only predictive variables that were selected with stepwise logistic regression analysis were age at onset (P <.002; odds ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.81) and ankle brachial index of less than 0.5 (P <.008; odds ratio, 6.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 27.3).\nAlthough 60% of the white men with premature PAD who were referred to a vascular surgery service had conditions that appeared to remain stable, these data show that approximately 40% of the patients will require multiple interventions because of disease progression or bypass graft failure. Clinical indicators, not serum markers, are predictors of poor outcome in patients with premature PAD. The results of this study suggest that patients with onset of PAD before the age of 43 years who have objective evidence of advanced disease are predisposed to multiple interventions.",

    "abstract": "Aggressive attempts at limb salvage in patients with ischemic tissue loss are justified by favorable initial results in most patients. The identification of patients whose conditions will not benefit from attempted revascularization remains difficult.\nThis study was designed as a retrospective review of prospectively collected clinical data. The subjects were 210 consecutive patients who underwent infrainguinal vein bypass grafting for ischemic tissue loss in the setting of an academic medical center. Bypass grafting was to the popliteal artery in 56 patients, to the infrapopliteal arteries in 131 patients, and to the pedal arteries in 23 patients. The follow-up examination was complete in 209 of 210 patients. One hundred twenty-five patients underwent blinded review of duplex scan venous mapping and arteriography to determine simplified vein and run-off scores. The outcome measures were the influence of risk factors, venous conduit, and runoff on mortality, limb loss, and graft failure at the 6-month follow-up examination.\nOne hundred seventy patients (81%) were alive and had limb salvage. Nineteen patients (9.1%) died, with need for a simultaneous inflow procedure and end-stage renal disease being most commonly associated with mortality. Thirty-three patients (15.8%) had undergone amputation: 18 after graft failure, and 15 for progressive tissue loss despite a patent graft. Amputation was significantly more common in patients with diabetes (P =.05) and with poor runoff scores (poor runoff, 44.4% vs good runoff, 7.4%; P <.01). Amputation despite a patent graft also correlated with runoff (poor runoff, 41.7% vs good runoff, 4.3%; P <.01). Twenty-five patients had graft failure without amputation, so that only 145 patients (69.4%) were alive, had limb salvage, and had a patent graft. Run-off score was the strongest predictor of outcome, with 70% of patients with poor run-off scores having death, amputation, or graft failure.\nAggressive use of infrainguinal vein bypass grafting in patients with ischemic tissue loss results in a high rate of initial limb salvage but significant morbidity and mortality. Arteriographically determined runoff scores appear to potentially identify patients at high risk for a poor initial outcome and may provide a method of selecting patients for primary amputation.",

The main outcome measures were incidence of intervention, incidence per demographic group, multivariate predictors of amputation versus revascularization, multivariate predictors of amputation versus revascularization among those patients with access to sophisticated care (hospital with arteriographic capabilities), and multivariate predictors of surgical bypass graft type (aortoiliac vs infrainguinal).\nA total of 51,819 procedures (9.1 per 10,000 population) were performed for PAOD during the study period and included 15,579 major lower extremity amputations (30.1%) and 36,240 revascularizations (69.9%). Although the incidence of a procedure for PAOD was comparable between African Americans and whites (9.0 vs 9.6 per 10, 000 demographic group), the incidence of amputation (5.0 vs 2.5 per 10,000 demographic group) was higher and the incidence of revascularization (4.0 vs 7.1 per 10,000 demographic group) was lower among African Americans. Furthermore, multivariate analysis results showed that African Americans (odds ratio, 3.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.34 to 4.30) were significantly more likely than whites to undergo amputation as opposed to revascularization.

    "abstract": "The endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) has been suggested as an alternative to conventional aortic reconstruction. The presence of anomalous renal vascular anatomy frequently necessitates special planning during conventional aortic replacement and may also create unique challenges for endovascular repair. We analyzed our experience with 24 patients with variant renal vascular anatomies who underwent treatment with aortic endografts to determine the safety and efficacy of this technique in this population.\nDuring a 6-year period, 204 patients underwent aortic endograft procedures, 24 (11.8%) of whom had variations in renal vascular anatomy. There were 19 men and five women. Each of the 24 patients had variant renal vascular anatomy, which was defined by the presence of multiple renal arteries (n = 32), with or without a renal parenchymal anomaly (horseshoe or solitary pelvic kidney). Twenty patients underwent aneurysm repair with balloon expandable polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, and the remaining patients underwent endograft placement with self-expanding attachment systems. Eighteen patients underwent exclusion and presumed thrombosis of anomalous renal branches to effectively attach the aortic endograft. The decision to sacrifice a supernumerary artery was made on the basis of the vessel size (<3 mm), the absence of coexisting renal insufficiency, and the expectation for successful aneurysm exclusion.\nThe successful exclusion of the AAAs was achieved in all the patients, with the loss of a total of 17 renal artery branches in 12 patients. Small segmental renal infarcts (<20%) were detected in only six of the 12 patients with follow-up computed tomographic scan results, despite angiographic evidence of vessel occlusion at the time of endografting. No evidence of new onset hypertension or changes in antihypertensive medication was seen in this group. No retrograde endoleaks were detected through the excluded renal branches on late follow-up computed tomographic scans. Serum creatinine levels before and after endografting were unchanged after the exclusion of the AAA in all but one patient with multiple renal branches. One patient had a transient rise in serum creatinine level presumed to be caused by contrast nephropathy.\nOn the basis of this experience, we recommend the consideration of endovascular grafting for patients with AAAs and anomalous renal vessels when the main renal vascular anatomy can be preserved and when the loss of only small branches (<3 mm) is necessitated in patients with otherwise normal renal functions.",

Forty-four operations on the patients of ASA class IV were performed with the transabdominal approach (25 for abdominal aortic aneurysms and 19 for aortoiliac occlusive disease), and 48 operations were performed with the retroperitoneal approach (27 for abdominal aortic aneurysms and 21 for aortoiliac occlusive disease). There were no significant differences between the groups for comorbid risk factors or perioperative care.\nAmong the patients of ASA class IV, eight (8.7%) died after operation (retroperitoneal, 3 [6.26%]; transabdominal, 5 [11.3%]; P =.5). There was no difference between groups in the number of pulmonary complications (retroperitoneal, 23 [47.9%]; transabdominal, 19 [43.2%]; P =.7) or in the development of incisional hernias (retroperitoneal, 6 [12.5%]; transabdominal, 5 [11.3%]; P =.5).

    "abstract": "Spinal cord ischemia after operation on the abdominal aorta is a rare event that is attributed to variations in the spinal cord blood supply. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible causes of this devastating event.\nA survey of patients among the members of the Southern Association for Vascular Surgery was performed, and 18 patients were identified with spinal cord ischemia manifested by paraplegia or paraparesis after abdominal aortic operation.\nPreoperative computed tomographic, magnetic resonance, and aortographic results did not visualize the greater radicular artery (Adamkiewicz's artery) in any patient. Eleven patients underwent resection of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs): seven of these patients had tube grafts, three had aortobifemoral grafts, and one had an aortobiiliac graft. Five other patients underwent placement of aortobifemoral grafts, and one patient underwent aortobiiliac graft placement for occlusive disease. One patient underwent suprarenal AAA resection with an interposition graft to a previous aortobiiliac graft. The mean operative time was 3 hours and 39 minutes (range, 2 hours and 45 minutes to 6 hours and 30 minutes), with a mean aortic cross-clamp time of 48 minutes (range, 24 to 97 minutes). Sixteen aortic cross-clamps were placed infrarenally and two suprarenally (one in a case of ruptured AAA, the other a suprarenal AAA). Seventeen proximal anastomoses were end to end. The average minimum systolic blood pressure during the aortic cross-clamping was 96 mm Hg (range, 80 to 130 mm Hg). All the patients had internal iliac artery flow preserved with either prograde perfusion (10 patients) or retrograde perfusion (eight patients), and one patient underwent unilateral internal iliac artery ligation because of aneurysmal disease. One aortobifemoral-graft limb necessitated thrombectomy, but no cases of massive peripheral embolization occurred. When paraplegia was suspected after operation (6 to 20 hours after surgery), five patients underwent lumbar drainage. No clinical improvement was noted.\nInterference with pelvic blood supply from prolonged aortic cross clamping, intraoperative hypotension, aortic embolization, and interruption of internal iliac artery circulation have all been suggested as possible causes of spinal cord ischemia. In this survey, none of these factors proved to be significant as the sole cause of spinal cord ischemia. In the performance of an aortic operation with an end-to-end proximal anastomosis in the presence of severe external or internal iliac artery disease, there may be an increased incidence of spinal cord ischemia despite appropriate surgical techniques to ensure internal iliac perfusion. Spinal cord ischemia after abdominal aortic operations appears to be a tragically unpredictable, random, and unpreventable event.",

    "abstract": "Drag reducing polymers (DRPs) have been shown to decrease plaque formation. Their mechanism of action is unknown. Atherosclerosis tends to develop in areas of low shear stress. This study investigates whether DRPs increase shear stress in areas normally exposed to low shear stress.\nSix dogs underwent surgical plication of the left half of the aorta. A specially modified 20-MHz Doppler ultrasound probe mounted at a 45-degree angle on a micromanipulator was used to measure blood flow velocity at six 4-mm intervals along both lateral sides of the aorta starting at the aortic wall and then at subsequent 0.1-mm depths moving into the lumen before and after administering DRP. Shear rates were calculated using linear regression and then compared using the paired t test. The blood viscosity remained constant at 0.04 poise during infusions of this amount of DRP.\nThe maximum shear rate occurring during the cardiac cycle on the side of the aortic stenosis (plication) was 9.96 +/- 1.52/sec before the administration of the DRP and 14.27 +/- 2.01/sec after the administration of the DRP (P =.0240). The maximum shear rate on the side of the unstenosed aortic wall was 57.25 +/- 7.93/sec before the administration of the DRP and 44.80 +/- 6.23/sec after the administration of the DRP (P =. 0081).\nOne of the ways that DRPs inhibit the development of atherosclerosis appears to be by increasing shear stress in areas normally exposed to low shear stress. Understanding this mechanism may lead to the development of pharmaceutical agents that inhibit the development of atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis is a stereotypical pathway of cell death that is orchestrated by a family of cysteine endoproteases called caspases. This study examined the effect of apoptosis inhibition with a specific caspase inhibitor on murine intestinal viability after ischemia-reperfusion (IR).\nC57Bl6 X SV129 mice underwent segmental small bowel ischemia by vascular isolation of 10 cm of terminal ileum. In separate experiments, the ischemic time was varied from 30 to 130 minutes with a reperfusion interval of 6 hours. The degree of small bowel injury was quantified from 1 to 5 (increasing severity) by standardized, blinded histologic grading. The degree of apoptosis was assessed with a specific assay (terminal deoxyamcleotydil transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling [TUNEL]) and quantified by calculating the apoptotic index (apoptotic cells/10 high-power fields). To evaluate for activation of interleukin-1beta converting enzyme we measured tissue mature interleukin-1beta levels using a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To evaluate the effect of apoptosis inhibition on intestinal viability after IR, mice received 3.0 mg of the caspase inhibitor ZVAD (N-benzyloxycarbonyl Val-Ala-Asp-Ome-fluoromethylketone) subcutaneously before and after IR in five divided doses (n = 11), the same dose of ZFA (N-benzyloxycarbonyl Phe-Ala fluoromethylketone), a structurally similar molecule with no anticaspase activity (n = 9), or sham operation (n = 6).\nA linear relationship existed between ischemic interval and histologic grade (r = 0.69, P <.006). Increasing the ischemic interval from 0 to 50 minutes was associated with a fivefold increase in apoptotic index (P =.05). Ischemic bowel was measured to have an average of 57.3 +/- 7.8 pg/mL whereas normal bowel had an average of 1.8 +/- 0.5 pg/mL of mature interleukin-1beta present. Mice tolerated multiple injections of ZVAD and ZFA without signs of toxicity. Animals treated with ZVAD (apoptosis inhibitor) had little injury after 50 minutes of ischemia and 6 hours of reperfusion (injury grade 1.8) compared with sham controls (injury grade 1.2, P =.7) and had significantly less injury than mice treated with ZFA (placebo) (injury grade 3.0, P <.006).\nIncreasing ischemic interval in a segmental small bowel murine IR model is associated with increased histologic injury and augmented apoptosis as evidenced by increased TUNEL staining and interleukin-1beta converting enzyme activation.

    "abstract": "Intimal hyperplasia at the venous anastomosis of dialysis access grafts causes early failure, although increased flow inhibits intimal hyperplasia in arterial grafts and after vessel injury. We designed a sheep model to study this process.\nPolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts were placed in the necks of sheep from the carotid artery to the external jugular vein. Grafts were harvested after perfusion fixation at 4, 8, and 12 weeks and submitted for histologic and immunohistochemical examination, including morphometry of neointimal lesions.\nThe venous anastomoses developed thick neointima within the PTFE graft by 4 weeks. Lesions at the venous end were significantly thicker than those at the arterial end by 8 weeks (1.2 +/- 0.1 vs 0.38 +/- 0.05 mm, P <.02) and had greater cross-sectional area at both 4 (0.32 +/- 0.21 vs 3.6 +/- 0.8 mm(2), n = 7, P <.02) and 8 weeks (9.8 +/- 1.9 vs 1.1 +/- 0.7 mm(2), n = 7, P <.02). Only one of the four grafts (25%) in the 12-week group remained patent. Lesions were composed of smooth muscle cells, matrix, and thrombus of various ages. Cellular proliferation was prominent in neointima adjacent to thrombus and in granulation tissue surrounding the graft. Organizing thrombus contributed significantly to luminal narrowing.\nThe sheep model of dialysis access reliably produces venous stenosis within 4 weeks. Lesions develop in the absence of uremia, graft puncture, or dialysis, suggesting that these factors are not necessary for graft failure. The continued presence of thrombus and high rates of cellular proliferation suggest ongoing injury is an important cause of lesion formation.

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that fibroblasts cultured from venous ulcers display characteristics of senescence and have reduced growth rates. Susceptibility of young fibroblasts to the microcirculatory changes associated with venous ulcers, such as macrophage trapping and activation, could explain the prevalence of senescent fibroblasts in these wounds.\nWe tested the in vitro effect of venous ulcer wound fluid (VUWF), as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines known to be present in VUWF (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and TGF-beta1), on neonatal foreskin fibroblasts (NFFs). NFF growth rates, cellular morphology, and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) activity were determined in the presence or absence of VUWF and the above cytokines. VUWF TNF-alpha concentration and the effect of anti-TNF-alpha antibody on VUWF inhibitory activity were determined in samples obtained from four patients with venous ulcers.\nNFF growth rates were significantly reduced by VUWF (42,727 +/- 6301 vs 3902 +/- 2191 P =. 006). TNF-alpha also significantly reduced NFF growth rates in a dose-dependent manner (P =.01). No significant growth-inhibitory activity was seen for IL-1alpha or TGF-beta. Incubation with VUWF significantly increased the percentage of SA-beta-Gal-positive fibroblasts in vitro on culture day 12 (P =.02). TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 had similar effects. TNF-alpha was detected in all VUWF tested, with a mean of 254 +/- 19 pg/mL.\nThese data suggest that the venous ulcer microenvironment adversely affects young, rapidly proliferating fibroblasts such as NFFs and induces fibroblast senescence. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 might be involved in this process. The role of other unknown inhibitory mediators, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, in venous ulcer development and impaired healing must be considered.",

    "abstract": "The long-term results and predictors of success for vascular access at The Toronto Hospital were studied. This report describes the access program and emphasizes the role of the vascular access coordinator.\nA total of 384 consecutive patients underwent 466 vascular access procedures. The access program is centered around a dedicated, full-time vascular access coordinator, who is a registered nurse and is responsible for all aspects of access care, including follow-up. Outcome variables were collected prospectively. Primary, primary-assisted, and secondary success was determined by means of Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the stepwise Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis of the factors that were independently predictive of primary success.\nThere were 235 autogenous arteriovenous fistulae (AVFs) and 231 arteriovenous grafts (AVGs). The cumulative primary, assisted-primary, and secondary success (patent and functional for effective dialysis) at 24 months for all 466 cases combined was 36% +/- 3%, 54% +/- 3%, and 66% +/- 3%, respectively. The primary success for AVFs and AVGs at 2 years was 54% +/- 4% and 18% +/- 4%, respectively (P <.001; log-rank test); the primary-assisted success for AVFs and AVGs at 2 years was 62% +/- 4% and 44% +/- 6%, respectively (P <.001; log-rank test); and the secondary success for AVFs and AVGs at 2 years was 70% +/- 4% and 60% +/- 5%, respectively (P =.331; log-rank test). Stratification of variables revealed significant benefit for AVFs (P =.001), the female sex (P =.014), and the absence of diabetes mellitus (P =.001). Multivariate analysis with Cox regression determined that access type (AVF vs AVG; P =.001) and diabetes mellitus (P =.024) were independently predictive of primary success. The improved clinical coordination of access patients with the initiation of the vascular access program resulted in a significant reduction in length of hospital stay before and after the program was organized (2.5 +/- 0.06 vs 1.1 +/- 0.03 days; P =.001).\nThe organization of a vascular access program in a practical and cost-effective way for reduced length of hospital stay is streamlined through a dedicated access coordinator, who ensures an integrated, multidisciplinary approach. The results for the Cox model is useful when discussing the anticipated results of access procedures with individual patients.",

    "abstract": "In many hospitals and medical practices, subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS) has become the treatment of choice in patients with incompetent perforator veins and active venous ulcers. A substantial number of surgeons consider SEPS to be an operation that can be performed only once because extensive scarring and narrowing of the subfascial space make a second endoscopic operation impossible. It is the purpose of this report to prove the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of a second SEPS procedure.\nWithin a period of 30 months, 105 primary SEPS procedures were performed in patients with healed or still active ulcers. In addition to these cases, within a period of 30 months, a consecutive number of 19 patients were examined and scheduled for a second SEPS procedure. All patients were in class 5 with healed ulcers or in class 6 with still active ulcers. The CEAP classification of the American Venous Forum was used to evaluate the results and to calculate the clinical, disability, and outcome scores. The redone operation was performed by using CO(2) insufflation, a dual-port technique, and subfascial balloon dissection.\nIn two patients conversion to a conventional procedure was necessary. There were no major complications, but there was a 21% incidence of minor problems, such as hematoma or cellulitis. The mean total clinical score improved after surgery from 7.91 to 3.23 (P <.01), the disability score changed from 1.10 to 0.57 after surgery (P <.02), and the clinical outcome score was 1. 47 after surgery (P <.001). Cumulative ulcer healing could be achieved in 85.8% of class 6 patients. Failure analysis revealed that an incomplete subfascial dissection had been performed during the first endoscopic operation. A septum intermusculare medialis or an intact deep posterior fascia with incompetent Cockett II perforators were major factors contributing to the initial treatment failures. In addition to incompetent perforators, postthrombotic deep venous reflux was seen in eight (42.1%) patients, and four (21%) patients had a combination of secondary reflux and obstruction.\nSubfascial endoscopic procedures can be redone safely. In addition to exploring the superficial posterior compartment, the deep posterior compartment must be opened to prevent recurrent symptoms in patients with incompetent perforator veins.",

Follow-up was done by repeated questionnaires 6 weeks after surgery. The Aberdeen Questionnaire was assessed for reliability, validity, responsiveness, and practicality. Quality of life of patients with varicose veins was compared with an age- and sex-matched sample of the general population.\nReliability estimates for the 8 scales short-form health survey (SF-36) and the Aberdeen Questionnaire were all above 0.7 (Cronbach's alpha). The Aberdeen Questionnaire had a highly significant correlation (r = 0. 74, P <.0001) with the patients' symptoms and concerns questionnaire, which is evidence of its validity. Patients with varicose veins score lower than United Kingdom norms (P <.001) in the physical domains of the SF-36, indicating worse health. After surgery, the SF-36 scores improved in all 8 domains of health, reaching significance in \"Mental Health\" (P <.05) and approaching significance in \"General Health\" (P =.066). The Health Transition Item of the SF-36 and the Aberdeen Questionnaire both showed a highly significant improvement in health (P <.001).\nThe Aberdeen Questionnaire is a valid measure of quality of life for patients with varicose veins.

    "abstract": "In patients with unilateral iliac disease, a less invasive procedure than aortobifemoral bypass grafting may be desirable, especially in poor-risk patients or when sexual dysfunction is feared. In these cases, femorofemoral (FF) bypass grafting is often proposed. Compared with FF bypass grafting, iliofemoral (IF) bypass grafting avoids bilateral exposure of the groins, which may reduce the risk of infection. When the primitive iliac artery is occluded from its origin or heavily calcified, one may use the contralateral artery as inflow, after a small retroperitoneal exposure, to perform a crossover iliofemoral (CIF) bypass grafting procedure, through the Retzius space. Our 10-year experience with CIF bypass grafting in a select group of patients was studied.\nBetween 1986 and 1996, 36 patients underwent CIF bypass grafting for symptomatic unilateral iliac occlusion or stenosis. All patients were examined by means of Doppler ultrasound scanning and underwent bilateral multiplane angiography. Patients were considered for this procedure when the ipsilateral common iliac artery was occluded from its origin or was diffusely and heavily calcified. The decision to perform a CIF bypass grafting procedure was made when no significant disease of the contralateral common iliac artery was seen, and patients who had features of contralateral iliac disease were excluded. The main outcomes were perioperative mortality and morbidity, long-term primary and secondary patency rates, and limb salvage rate.\nThe study included 31 men and five women, with a mean age of 58.8 years. Indications for bypass grafting were disabling claudication (26 of 36 patients, 72%) and limb-threatening ischemia (10 of 26 patients, 28%). Twelve procedures were performed simultaneously: endarterectomy of the recipient common femoral artery (n = 3), femoropopliteal bypass grafting (n = 4, 11.1%), profundoplasty (n = 4, 11%), and right internal carotid endarterectomy (n = 1). New postoperative erectile dysfunction did not develop in any of the patients. The survival rate was 97.3% at 1 year and 68.5% at 5 years. The primary and secondary patency rates were 94% and 100%, respectively, at 1 year and 76.7% and 95%, respectively, at 5 years. The limb salvage rate was 100% at 1 year and 87% at 3 years.\nThe operative mortality associated with CIF is low. The long-term primary and secondary patency rates are satisfactory, and they are lower than those reported for aortobifemoral bypass grafting. This procedure does not preclude a later performance of an aortobifemoral bypass grafting procedure. CIF bypass grafting is not only suitable for poor-risk patients with a limited life expectancy who have the appropriate arterial anatomy, but also may be warranted for young patients in whom erectile dysfunction is feared.",

From 1980 to 1997, 46 patients with chronic lower limb ischemia with moderate to severe claudication as the result of isolated infrarenal disease or aortoiliac disease underwent PTA. All patients underwent angiography before and after angioplasty and Doppler ultrasound scan examination with ankle-brachial index determination. No stents were used.\nThe technical success rate was 96% (44 of 46 cases). Thirty-eight patients (83%) immediately showed clinical, hemodynamic, and angiographic improvement. The initial success rate for patients with isolated infrarenal or bifurcation disease was 92%, whereas it was 71% for aortoiliac disease. Among the eight patients with no initial improvement, four had clinical deterioration and two required emergency surgical revascularization. There were no other complications. Fifty-six percent of the patient conditions (95% confidence interval [CI], 38% to 74%) remained clinically improved at the 5-year follow-up examination. Recurrence of symptoms was caused by femoropopliteal disease in most patients. The primary patency rate assumed with maintenance of hemodynamic improvements was 70% (95% CI, 52% to 88%) and 64% (95% CI, 44% to 84%) at 4 and 5 years of follow-up, respectively. The primary patency rate at 4 years for patients with isolated infrarenal or bifurcation disease was 83% (95% CI, 64% to 100%), whereas it was 55% for aortoiliac disease (95% CI, 30% to 80%; P =.06) The variables that were statistically predictive of patency failure were poor runoff (P =. 01) and presence of aortoiliac atherosclerotic disease (P =.04).\nOur results suggest that PTA is an excellent treatment for chronic arterial insufficiency of the lower extremities as the result of isolated atherosclerotic lower abdominal aortic occlusive lesions because of good long-term patency. Aortic PTA for those patients with iliac involvement or with poor runoff gives acceptable results but carries lower patency and clinical success rates.",

Adequate reporting of data is necessary to judge the quality of economic studies by means of critical appraisal criteria.\nA systematic review of the journal literature between 1986 and the first half of 1997 was undertaken. Studies that have attempted to estimate the resource consequences of one or more vascular procedure were the focus of the review.

When subjected to the reporting guidelines, the studies performed rather poorly overall.\nAlthough the vascular studies can be criticized for inadequate reporting of economic data, it appears from the limited evidence from elsewhere that inadequate reporting is a problem in other clinical areas.

    "abstract": "Perigraft endoleakage is a major complication of the endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. The factors that cause this form of endoleakage are not completely identified. The effect of sizing of the prosthesis in combination with either self-expandable or balloon-expandable stents is evaluated in this study. Further, the influence of atherosclerotic changes on endoleakage is evaluated.\nEight human abdominal aortas were assessed macroscopically at 11 sites for the presence of atherosclerotic changes with intravascular ultrasound scanning (IVUS) and with computed tomography (CT). Five aortas were placed in in vitro circulation with physiologic parameters. After the determination of the proximal and distal landing site of the stent graft, the diameter and surface measurements of the cross sections were taken. The stent graft diameters were chosen from 4-mm undersizing to 6-mm oversizing, both for Gianturco stent grafts (William Cook Europe A/S, Bjaeverskov, Denmark) and for Palmaz stent grafts (Cordis/Johnson & Johnston Co, Warren, NJ). After placement of the stent graft, the diameter and surface measurements of the aortic cross section were determined at the proximal and distal stent attachment sites. The presence and size of the folds at the stent attachment site and the interface with the aortic wall were determined with IVUS and angioscopy. Endoleakage was evaluated with angiography. After angioplasty of the stent attachment site, IVUS, angioscopy, and angiography were repeated.\nRegarding atherosclerotic changes of the aortic wall, the correlations between clinical impression and CT, clinical impression and IVUS, and CT and IVUS were high (r = 0.77, r = 0.79 and r = 0.79, respectively). For the Gianturco stent grafts, no significant relationship existed between the diameters measured before and after stent graft placement, leading to great differences in intended and achieved oversizing. The achieved oversizing was less in the case of minimal atherosclerotic changes of the aortic wall. The Gianturco stent graft followed the aortic wall closely during the heart cycle. The sizes of the folds of the fabric were clearly correlated with the achieved oversizing (r = 0.83; P =.04) and the grade of endoleakage (r = 0.88; P =.022). Angioplasty after stent graft placement had no effect on the diameter and the grade of endoleakage. Palmaz stent grafts did not follow the aortic wall during the heart cycle. A significant correlation existed between oversizing and both space between aortic wall and stent graft (r = -0.88; P =.02) and grade of endoleakage (r = 0.84; P =.036). Grade of endoleakage in the Palmaz stent graft group was less than in the Gianturco stent graft group.\nWith the use of Gianturco stents, a great difference between intended and achieved oversizing is accomplished. The atherosclerotic changes of the aortic wall possibly affect this finding. The configuration of the Gianturco stent results in the formation of fold in the case of oversizing, which is associated with endoleakage. However, the self-expandable character of the stent leads to a close relation to the aortic wall during the heart cycle, and this may possibly accommodate future aortic neck dilation. The Palmaz stent grafts do not follow the aortic wall during the heart cycle, but they do lead to better interface between the graft and the aortic wall, which results in less endoleakage.",

    "abstract": "The low invasiveness of endoluminal abdominal aneurysm repair (EAAR) appears optimal for the use of epidural anesthesia (EA). However, reported series on EAAR show that general anesthesia (GA) is generally preferred. To evaluate the feasibility and problems encountered with EA for EAAR, patients undergoing EAAR with EA and patients undergoing EAAR with GA were examined.\nFrom April 1997 through October 1998, EAAR was performed on 119 patients at the Unit of Vascular Surgery at Policlinico Monteluce in Perugia, Italy. Four patients (3%) required conversion to open repair and were excluded from the analysis because they were not suitable candidates for evaluating the feasibility of EA. The study cohort thus comprised 115 patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair with the AneuRx Medtronic stent graft. The incidence of risk factors and anatomical features of the aneurysm were compared in patients selected for EA or GA on the basis of intention-to-treat analysis. Intraoperative and perioperative data were compared and analyzed on the basis of intention-to-treat and on-treatment analysis.\nSixty-one patients (54%) underwent the surgical procedure with EA (group A), and 54 (46%) underwent the surgical procedure with GA (group B). Conversion from EA to GA was required in four patients (3 of 61 patients, 5%). There were no statistically significant differences between the two study groups in demographics, clinical characteristics, and American Society of Anesthesiology classification (ASA).

    "abstract": "Hemorrhage and thrombosis predisposing to myocardial infarction, multiple organ failure, and thromboembolism account for the majority of the morbidity and mortality associated with repair of ruptured and nonruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). The aim of this study was to examine coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients operated on for ruptured and nonruptured infrarenal AAAs.\nTen patients operated on for ruptured and 9 patients operated on for nonruptured AAAs were studied. Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen, thrombin-antithrombin (TAT), and D-dimer were measured before induction of anesthesia. Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity, t-PA activity, and prothrombin fragment (PF) 1+2 were measured before induction of anesthesia, immediately before aortic clamp release, and 5 minutes and 24 hours after aortic clamp release.\nPreoperatively, ruptured AAA was associated with significantly elevated t-PA antigen (median 15.7 ng/mL, range 9. 0 to 22.1 ng/mL versus nonrupture: median 6.6 ng/mL, range 4.7 to 16. 4 ng/mL; P <.01, Mann-Whitney test), increased PAI activity (median 36.5 arbitrary units/mL, range 20.6 to 38.8 arbitrary units/mL versus nonrupture: median 8.2 arbitrary units/mL, range 3.2 to 21.7 arbitrary units/mL; P <.001), reduced t-PA activity (median 0.12 IU/mL, range 0.06 to 0.4 IU/mL versus nonrupture: median 0.49 IU/mL, range 0.14 to 3.2 IU/mL; P <.01), elevated TAT (median 135.5 microg/L, range 61.2 to 209.4 microg/L versus nonrupture: median 21. 6 microg/L, range 6.6 to 180.4 microg/L; P <.02) and elevated PF 1+2 (median 9.0 nmol/L, range 5.4 to 11.6 nmol/L versus nonrupture: median 2.2 nmol/L, range 0.7 to 7.1 nmol/L, P <.001). There was no significant difference in preoperative D-dimer levels (median 3460 ng/mL, range 1236 to 7860 ng/mL versus nonrupture: median 1642 ng/mL, range 728 to 5334 ng/mL; P =.07). The differences in PAI activity, t-PA activity, and PF 1+2 persisted throughout the course of surgery, but there was no significant difference between the groups at 24 hours.\nThese novel data demonstrate that ruptured AAA repair is associated with inhibition of systemic fibrinolysis and intense thrombin generation. Similar changes are seen in nonruptured AAA but are of a lesser magnitude. This procoagulant state may contribute to the microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis that leads to myocardial infarction, multiple organ failure, and thromboembolism.",

    "abstract": "In an earlier report of our database for 1924 isolated carotid endarterectomies (CEAs) from 1989 to 1995, multivariable analysis results indicated that the urgency of operation unfavorably influenced the combined stroke and mortality rate (CSM). This study was conducted in an attempt to document the features that contribute to perioperative complications and late outcome in 314 patients for whom CEA was considered to be nonelective because of the severity of previous symptoms, carotid stenosis, or medical comorbidities.\nAll the hospital charts and outpatient records were reviewed retrospectively for the 209 men and 105 women who had undergone nonelective CEAs (median age, 69 years). Information regarding the clinical risk factors, the operative indications (CHAT classification), the severity and distribution of carotid disease, and the surgical management were analyzed to assess the impact on the 30-day CSM and on the long-term survival rate and neurologic events during a median follow-up period of 34 months.\nPrevious symptoms had occurred in 285 patients (91%) and included cortical transient ischemic attacks in 47%, amaurosis fugax in 20%, completed strokes in 14%, unstable strokes in 2%, and nonspecific or miscellaneous symptoms in 8%. Preoperative angiography was performed in 308 patients (98%), which confirmed the presence of 80% to 99% ipsilateral carotid stenosis in 79% of the patients and >90% stenosis in 43%. The median interval between presentation and surgical treatment was 2 days, but 48% of the 314 CEAs were performed within 24 hours of presentation. The 30-day CSM was 6.7% and ranged from 3.4% for 29 patients with severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis to 14% for those patients with unstable strokes. The cardiac and pulmonary risk factors were the only variables that were related statistically to the CSM. During the follow-up period, the risk for ipsilateral stroke was significantly higher in women (risk ratio [RR], 2.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 5.56; P =.04) and in patients with higher gradients of cardiac and pulmonary risk factors (RR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.6 to 4.8 per gradient increase; P <.001). The risk was significantly lower in patients who had undergone vein patch angioplasty (RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0. 71; P =.006) in comparison with synthetic patching. However, 38 of the 55 patients (69%) who underwent synthetic patching also had widespread atherosclerosis for which the saphenous veins already had been harvested for coronary bypass grafting surgery or infrainguinal revascularization.\nIn our experience, the perioperative risk of nonelective CEA primarily is determined by incidental cardiopulmonary disease. Vein patch angioplasty appears to enhance late results, but the late stroke rate associated with synthetic patching also may have been influenced by the extent of vascular disease in our study group.",

Stenosis was reported as measured in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. In patients with >70% stenosis, carotid endarterectomy was associated with a pooled relative risk reduction of 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27% to 73%) and an absolute risk reduction of 6.7% (95% CI, 3.2% to 10%) for the outcome of death or major disability from stroke. This translates into a number needed to treat of 15 (95% CI, 10 to 31). For patients with 50% to 69% stenosis, the benefit of surgery was less and the confidence intervals were wider. A relative risk reduction of 27% (95% CI, 5% to 44%), an absolute risk reduction of 4.7% (95% CI, 0.8% to 8.7%), and a number needed to treat of 21 (95% CI, 11 to 125) were observed in this group. The patients with the lowest degrees of stenosis (<50%) were harmed by the intervention (number needed to harm, 45). Increasing degree of stenosis, increasing age, male sex, the presence of other medical risk factors, and the presence of hemispheric rather than retinal antecedent events were factors that increased the benefits from surgery.\nCarotid endarterectomy reduced death or major disability from stroke in patients with >50% symptomatic stenosis. To maximize the benefits of surgery, careful preoperative risk assessment and the maintenance of low rates of major perioperative complications are mandatory.",

Stenosis was reported as measured in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. In patients with >70% stenosis, carotid endarterectomy was associated with a pooled relative risk reduction of 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27% to 73%) and an absolute risk reduction of 6.7% (95% CI, 3.2% to 10%) for the outcome of death or major disability from stroke. This translates into a number needed to treat of 15 (95% CI, 10 to 31). For patients with 50% to 69% stenosis, the benefit of surgery was less and the confidence intervals were wider. A relative risk reduction of 27% (95% CI, 5% to 44%), an absolute risk reduction of 4.7% (95% CI, 0.8% to 8.7%), and a number needed to treat of 21 (95% CI, 11 to 125) were observed in this group. The patients with the lowest degrees of stenosis (<50%) were harmed by the intervention (number needed to harm, 45). Increasing degree of stenosis, increasing age, male sex, the presence of other medical risk factors, and the presence of hemispheric rather than retinal antecedent events were factors that increased the benefits from surgery.",

    "abstract": "Acetazolamide (ACZ)-enhanced single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans can assess both cerebral perfusion and vascular reactivity. Patients with asymptomatic critical carotid artery stenosis were evaluated for cerebral vascular reactivity to determine the effect of extracranial occlusive disease and the effect of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on intracerebral reactivity.\nIn 44 patients with asymptomatic critical carotid artery stenosis, cerebral perfusion and vascular reactivity were assessed before CEA with resting and ACZ-enhanced SPECT scans. All patients had a 70% or greater ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis. Preoperative ACZ-enhanced SPECT scans were obtained, usually 5 days before CEA. Postoperative ACZ-enhanced SPECT scans were obtained in 30 patients.\nPreoperative SPECT scans were asymmetric, revealing focal (n = 19) or global (n = 15) decreased reactivity in 34 patients (77%). Ten patients had symmetric or normal reactivity. After CEA, 23 patients demonstrated an improvement in reactivity ipsilateral to the side of surgery. The remaining seven patients failed to improve after surgery.\nAlthough all patients had a high-grade internal carotid stenosis, nearly a quarter of the patients had excellent intracerebral collateral flow. Only 71% of patients demonstrated improved intracerebral vasoreactivity after CEA. The lack of improvement in the other patients may have resulted from intracerebral pathology or lack of improvement in the extracranial carotid hemodynamics.",

    "abstract": "This report summarizes our experience with the popliteal entrapment syndrome in 88 limbs (48 patients) treated during a 10-year period.\nThe study cohort consisted of a retrospective analysis of those patients who were seen with symptoms of claudication or severe ischemia by a single surgical group and in whom unequivocal evidence of popliteal entrapment was shown either with angiography or at the time of operation. The cases were collected prospectively in a private vascular surgical practice.\nBilateral popliteal entrapment was found in 40 of the 48 patients. The mean age at the time of presentation was 35.0 years (SD, 11.6 years). Claudication was the most frequent presenting symptom (70 of 88 limbs). Types I, II, III, and IV popliteal entrapment were found in 58 limbs (15 arteries occluded), and 30 limbs (three occlusions) were seen with a \"functional\" popliteal artery entrapment (apparent absence of a developmental anatomic abnormality). Of the 18 limbs with severe ischemia and associated occlusion of the popliteal artery, 15 underwent bypass grafting with reversed saphenous vein grafts, all of which remained patent during the follow-up period (median follow-up, 4.2 years; range, 1 to 10 years). One popliteal artery occlusion that was treated with thrombectomy and vein patching occluded within 6 months and necessitated subsequent vein grafting. Two limbs with inoperable occluded popliteal arteries were not subjected to reconstruction (one necessitated amputation because of advanced ischemia, and the second had extensive thrombosis of the distal run-off). In two patients (four limbs), moderate presenting symptoms abated without surgery after the discontinuation of an extreme exercise program. The remaining limbs underwent surgical decompression (all popliteal arteries remained patent, with a median follow-up of 3.9 years).\nThe popliteal entrapment syndrome is more prevalent than has formerly been appreciated. On the basis of observations made in this series and in the surgical literature, we advise surgical correction in all cases of types I, II, III, and IV entrapment at the time of diagnosis to avoid occlusion as a result of continued arterial wall degeneration. In contrast, decompression is only advised in those patients with \"functional entrapment\" if they have discrete and typical symptoms because up to 50% of the normal population may display transient popliteal artery compression with extremes of plantar flexion or dorsiflexion. On the basis of the severe histologic changes found in those popliteal arteries that had undergone occlusion at the time of presentation, it is advised that the popliteal artery should be completely replaced, ideally with a vein graft, when significant degeneration or occlusion of the popliteal artery is noted at the time of operation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to further the development of a compliant vascular graft with a preliminary assessment of the elastic properties of the femoropopliteal artery in subjects with and without lower limb peripheral vascular disease.\nThis prospective controlled study was set in a university department of surgery. Using an ultrasound scan wall tracking system with the simultaneous measurement of brachial blood pressure, measurements of femoropopliteal artery wall motion were undertaken in 11 patients with peripheral vascular disease (group 1), in 11 older control subjects who were matched for blood pressure, age, and sex (group 2), and in 12 younger control subjects (group 3). Diametrical compliance and stiffness index were determined for the common femoral artery, the proximal superficial femoral artery, the distal superficial femoral artery (DSFA), and the midgenicular popliteal artery.\nAll the arterial segments in group 1 showed a trend towards increased stiffness and less compliance than the group 2, age-matched control vessels, with significantly lower distensibility noted at the common femoral artery (mean compliance of 6.2% vs 14.1% mm Hg(-1) x 10(-2), respectively; P <.05) and the DSFA (mean compliance of 2.2% vs 1.9% mm Hg(-1) x 10(-2), respectively; P <.05). The popliteal artery segment in group 3 proved to be more compliant and less stiff than did the same vessel in group 2 (8.5% vs 4.7% mm Hg(-1) x 10(-2), respectively; P <.01). In all three study groups, the DSFA was consistently noted to be the least distensible vessel segment.\nLower limb peripheral vascular disease is associated with a reduction in femoropopliteal artery elasticity. Age alone appears to have a minimal effect on the compliance of the proximal half of the femoropopliteal segment. The elastic properties of the femoropopliteal vessel are subject to marked variation along its course. To minimize compliance mismatch, the degree of elasticity engineered into a vascular graft must reflect that observed in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Large studies have shown that most cases referred for duplex sonography for suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) have normal scan results. For medical and economic reasons, a preselection procedure, which allows the detection of true-negative cases before duplex scanning, is required; this procedure should be characterized by a high sensitivity and a high negative predictive value.\nIn 343 patients (398 lower extremities) with suspected DVT, the DVT probability was clinically assessed, and a whole blood D-dimer agglutination test and a duplex scan were performed. The diagnostic sensitivities of the D-dimer test alone, a high clinical DVT probability alone, and the combination of both were evaluated.\nThe sensitivity values for the D-dimer test to diagnose proximal and distal DVTs were 88.7% and 80.9%, the negative predictive values (NPV) were 96.3% and 97.9%, and the specificity and the positive predictive value (PPV) were 54.8% and 49.6% and 26.6% and 8.2%, respectively. The sensitivities of the clinical DVT probability assessment for the diagnosis of proximal and distal DVTs were 83.9% and 66.7%, respectively; the corresponding NPVs were 94.9% and 96.5%, respectively. The specificity was 56.1% and 50.8%, and the PPVs were 26.1% and 7.0%, respectively. The combined use of the results of the clinical probability assessment and the D-dimer test resulted in sensitivities for proximal and distal DVTs of 98.4% and 90.5%, NPVs of 99.3% and 98.6%, a specificity of 43.4% and 38.4%, and PPVs of 24. 3% and 7.6%, respectively.\nThe combined use of a clinical DVT probability assessment scheme and the D-dimer test largely avoids false negative results, has a high sensitivity and NPV, helps to reduce the costs of DVT diagnosis, and may, in the future, be useful as a preselection procedure before duplex sonography.",

However, less than half of all RAAA patients were transferred, and only a small minority of those not transferred underwent surgery. Although the overall community mortality from RAAA was similar to that reported in earlier studies from other regions and countries where centralization has not occurred, centralization of vascular surgical services may be associated with an inappropriately low operation and survival rate for those patients who are not transferred to the regional center.

    "abstract": "Isolated aneurysms of the iliac arteries are uncommon lesions that require surgical repair to prevent rupture.\nDuring a 4-year period, we used endovascular stented grafts (EGs) to treat 28 iliac artery aneurysms that were not associated with aortic aneurysms. Twenty-five patients, with a total of 24 common iliac (15 right, nine left) and four internal iliac (two right, two left) artery aneurysms, underwent endovascular grafting. There were 24 men and 1 woman, with a mean age of 74 years (range, 51 to 88 years). Combined common and internal iliac artery aneurysms were present in three patients. Nineteen patients who underwent treatment with EGs were administered epidural anesthesia (22 epidural, two local, one general). Before surgery, one patient had lower extremity embolization and ischemia from the aneurysm, three had abdominal or back pain, and the remaining were asymptomatic. The EGs were constructed of polytetrafluoroethylene grafts and balloon expandable stents.\nFour procedure-related complications (12%) occurred (distal extremity embolization, n = 1; wound complications, n = 2; colonic mucosal ischemia, n = 1). Only a minimal reduction in the aneurysmal diameter was seen in 90% of the iliac artery aneurysms treated. The remaining lesions showed no change in size, and no aneurysm had an increase in cross-sectional diameter on computed tomographic images enduring a follow-up period up to 4 years (mean, 24 months). One aneurysm ruptured after successful endovascular exclusion, and the patient underwent treatment with open repair. The 3-year primary patency rate of iliac EGs was 86%.\nEGs appear to show satisfactory safety and efficacy for the repair of isolated aneurysms of the iliac arteries.",

There was only one perioperative death in a patient whose aneurysm ruptured in the operating room just before endovascular repair. The median postoperative length of hospital stay was 3.0 +/- 1.3 days in this group of patients at moderate and high risk. The long-term complications included one graft thrombosis and two endoleaks. One small endoleak was followed until the patient died of unrelated causes, and the other one led to aneurysm rupture in the only patient temporarily lost to follow-up examination.

    "abstract": "A method of achieving successful completion of endoluminal repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in the presence of intraoperative iatrogenic rupture of the aneurysm is reported.\nAn 83-year-old woman with an AAA that was 7 cm in diameter was treated electively by means of endoluminal repair with a Vanguard bifurcated prosthesis (Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass). No difficulty was experienced with the introduction of the delivery catheter, despite extreme angulation in the aneurysm. An acute episode of hypotension prompted an aortogram to be performed. Extravasation of contrast outside the aneurysm sac was demonstrated. The balloon on the delivery catheter was immediately advanced to the suprarenal aorta and inflated. Hypotension was reversed, and hemodynamic stability was restored, thus enabling deployment of the prosthesis to proceed and the repair to be completed by means of the endoluminal method.\nThe patient's blood pressure remained stable after deflation of the balloon, allowing a postprocedure aortogram to be performed. Exclusion of the aneurysm sac was demonstrated.

    "abstract": "Organization, recanalization, and contraction are common to wound healing and thrombus resolution. Monocytes are essential to wound healing and are also found in venous thrombi. We measured endogenous levels of the monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in naturally resolving venous thrombi and determined the effect of injecting MCP-1 into newly formed thrombus.\nEndogenous MCP-1 levels were estimated in rat blood, thrombi, and the adjacent vessel wall after thrombus formation, in cohorts of eight animals at 1, 7, and 14 days. In another group (n = 10), 1 microgram of MCP-1 was injected into newly formed thrombi. Carrier was injected into the thrombi of control animals (n = 10). Thrombi and adjacent vein walls were obtained for histology at 7 days. Thrombi were given an arbitrary organization score based on erythrocyte and extracellular matrix content, which was assessed by means of computerized and observer analysis. Specimen weight, thrombus area, and cellular and monocyte content were measured.\nEndogenous MCP-1 increased between days 1 and 7 in the thrombus (1-day median, 1.1 ng/g wet wt; 1-day range, 0.8 to 1.4 ng/g wet wt; 7-day median, 5.4 ng/g wet wt; 7-day range, 1.5 to 7.4 ng/g wet wt; P <.0001) and vein wall (1-day median, 1.5 ng/g wet wt; 1-day range, 0.8 to 4.3 ng/g wet wt; 7-day median, 3.3 ng/g wet wt; 7-day range, 2.7 to 8.3 ng/g wet wt; P <. 05). At 14 days, thrombus was incorporated in the vein wall, and total MCP-1 levels remained high (median, 3.9 ng/g wet wt; range, 1.1 to 7.4 ng/g wet wt). Less MCP-1 was found in the thrombus than the adjacent vessel wall at day 1 (P <.05), but there was no difference at day 7. MCP-1 could not be detected in the blood. MCP-1 injection into thrombus increased the computer (P =.016) and observer (P =.004) organization scores, reduced the thrombus area (from median, 3. 4 mm(2), and range, 1.5 to 5.7 mm(2), to median, 0.2 mm(2), and range, 0.02 to 2.6 mm(2); P =.048), and increased the surrounding vessel wall monocyte content (P =.008). Specimen weights of treated animals were lower than those of control animals (P <.02).\nVenous thrombus MCP-1 levels increase during natural resolution. MCP-1 treatment increased the organization and resolution of thrombi. MCP-1 may therefore be of therapeutic use.",

    "abstract": "Thrombus organization after venous thromboembolism leading to recanalization occurs at a variable rate. The angiogenic chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) has been found in thrombus months after thrombus initiation. We hypothesize that thrombus organization involves neovascularization and leukocyte influx and that IL-8 administered at thrombus induction will promote thrombus organization.\nA group of rats underwent inferior vena caval occlusive thrombosis. At thrombus induction and every 24 hours, the rats were administered IL-8 (1 microgram) or serum albumin. The rats were killed at either day 4, day 8, or day 12, and, at death, colloidal carbon was perfused via the heart. The inferior vena cava was isolated, measured, weighed, and formalin fixed. The sections were stained with anti-polymorphonuclear leukocyte antibody, the endothelial marker factor VIII-related antigen, and with hematoxylin and eosin. Thrombus neovascularization (colloidal carbon) with morphometric analysis was normalized to the total thrombus area. In addition, the rats underwent perfusion with fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (molecular weight, 150,000) at death to correlate with colloidal carbon perfusion, and thrombus fluorescence was determined.\nThrombus cellularity initially involved neutrophils, followed by monocytes. Significantly more neutrophils, monocytes, and cells that were defined as spindle shaped (fibroblasts and endothelial cells) were noted in the animals treated with IL-8. Neovascularization was significantly increased at day 4 in the animals treated with IL-8 versus the animals treated with serum albumin and was corroborated with a significant increase in thrombus fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran fluorescence at day 4 in the rats treated with IL-8. Colloidal carbon perfusion was noted within vascular channels without extravasation and colocalized with factor VIII-related antigen.\nThis study shows that thrombus organization involves neovascularization and that IL-8 augments thrombus organization.",

Segments of the greater saphenous veins and the adjacent tributaries were obtained from patients who underwent vein stripping and excision of primary varicose veins. The saphenous veins from the patients who underwent peripheral arterial bypass grafting were used as controls. The segments of veins were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution in the presence of venotropic extract of Ruscus aculeatus (10(-3) g/mL) or in water-miscible organic solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide, 10(-3) g/mL), for 1, 5, and 10 minutes at 37 degrees C. The nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 10(-4) g/mL) was used to block cyclic nucleotide degradation in some samples. Tissue and media samples were collected. Tissue concentrations of both cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cAMP and cGMP, respectively) and media concentrations of 6-ketoprostaglandin-F(1)(alpha) (the stable metabolite of prostacyclin) and thromboxane B(2) (the stable metabolite of thromboxane A(2)) were measured by means of radioimmunoassay. Cyclooxygenase 2 was measured with Western blot analysis.\nThe varicose veins showed greater levels of cAMP but not of cGMP at all time points as compared with the control veins. Prostanoid production was not significantly altered in the varicose veins. Stimulation with Ruscus aculeatus increased the cAMP concentration in the varicose veins but did not affect the cGMP levels. The ratio between 6-ketoprostaglandin-F(1)(alpha) and thromboxane B(2) was two-fold greater in the varicose veins as compared with the control veins. In the presence of the extract, the ratio of 6-ketoprostaglandin-F(1)(alpha) and thromboxane B(2) was identical in both types of veins. Cyclooxygenase 2 was not present in either the control or the varicose veins.\nThese results suggest that cAMP levels are elevated in varicose veins and that they can be altered with drug treatment in varicose veins.

    "abstract": "Treatment of chronic venous valvular insufficiency requires understanding of the hemodynamics of perforating veins. To preserve normal veins or veins that can function normally once primary sources of valvular insufficiency are removed, a better understanding of the diameter-reflux relationship is desirable. We measured reflux and diameters in 500 perforating veins of patients with varicose veins (C(2)E(P)A(SP)P(R)).\nColor flow duplex ultrasonography scanning was performed with the patient standing. Perforating veins were mapped medially in the thigh and medially, laterally, and posteriorly in the calf. Reflux was defined as reverse flow that lasted longer than 0.5 seconds. Diameters were measured on B-mode transverse projections at the crossing of the fascia. Competent versus incompetent vein diameters were compared by means of Student t test, one-way analysis of variance, and Bonferroni t test.\nDiameters of competent and incompetent perforators averaged 2.5 +/- 0.9 mm (n = 17) and 4.7 +/- 1.9 mm (n = 17) at the medial thigh (P <.0002), 2.2 +/- 0.8 mm (n = 179) and 3.7 +/- 1.0 mm (n = 210) at the medial calf (P <.0001), 2.2 +/- 0.6 mm (n = 13) and 3.5 +/- 0.8 mm (n = 37) at the posterior calf (P <. 0001), and 2.1 +/- 0.8 mm (n = 9) and 3.3 +/- 0.7 mm (n = 18) at the lateral calf (P <.003), respectively. Perforating vein diameters of 3.5 mm or larger in the calf and thigh were associated with reflux in more than 90% of the cases.\nAn enlargement in the diameter of the perforating veins of 1 to 1.5 mm in the calf or 2 mm in the thigh of patients with varicose veins could be the difference between normal flow and reflux. Further studies are needed to confirm if elimination of reflux in patients with primary varicosity will transform incompetent perforators to competent ones.",

The exclusion criteria included untreated superficial/perforator venous disease, significant venous or arterial obstruction, hypercoagulability or coagulopathy, and significant preexisting medical conditions. Required preoperative tests were venous duplex, ascending/descending venography, and a physiologic study (eg, APG, blood typing, an ankle/brachial index, and if post-thrombotic, a hypercoagulability work-up). A single-valve transplant was placed below all reflux, aided by anticoagulation with or without a distal arteriovenous fistula. Postoperative assessment included duplex scanning/clinical examination (at 1, 3, and 6 months), descending venogram (at 1 month), and physiologic study (at 1 and 6 months). The primary end point was valve patency/competence, with clinical outcome as a secondary end point. Adverse events were recorded.\nAfter eliminating protocol violations, nine patients with superficial femoral (5) or popliteal (4) vein valve transplants were studied. Six-month actuarial results show a patency rate of 67% +/- 16% and 78% +/- 13%, respectively, a primary and secondary competency rate of 56% +/- 17% and 67% +/- 16%, respectively, and a 100% patient survival rate. Clinical outcome averaged 1.1, with healing and/or freedom from ulcer recurrence, in six of nine patients. A postoperative risk of seroma formation (3) and cellulitis (1) exists.\nIn patients with few remaining therapeutic options, one can achieve a 6-month assisted patency and competency rate of 78% and 67%, respectively, with an improved clinical outcome.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed whether the increased numbers of platelet-monocyte aggregates observed in patients with venous stasis ulceration (VSU) represent a response to dermal ulceration or if it is a condition associated with underlying chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). We also analyzed the expression of CD11b in patients with CVI to determine whether leukocyte activation, known to occur in VSU, is a precursor of or a response to ulceration.\nPatients with varying classes of CVI (n = 24) and healthy control subjects (n = 15), whose status was documented by means of duplex scanning, stood upright and stationary for 10 minutes. Two aliquots of blood, drawn from a distal leg vein and an antecubital fossa vein, were incubated with either buffer or one of three platelet agonists. After fixation, these samples were further incubated with fluorescent-labeled monoclonal antibodies (f-MoAb) specific for CD14 (monocytes) and CD61 (platelets). The activated leukocyte assay was performed by incubating another aliquot of the blood samples with f-MoAb specific for CD11b and CD14. All samples were evaluated by means of flow cytometry.\nWe observed significantly more platelet-monocyte aggregates throughout the circulation in patients with CVI than in control subjects (29% vs. 8%; P <.0002). Furthermore, patients with CVI formed significantly more of these aggregates in response to all platelet agonists than did control subjects. There were no significant differences between baseline numbers of aggregates or response to agonists in patients who had CVI with (n = 10) or without (n = 14) ulceration. Patients with CVI had more circulating platelet-neutrophil aggregates than control subjects (7.2% vs. 3.6%; P =.05). The addition of platelet agonists to the blood of patients with CVI resulted in more platelet-neutrophil aggregates than in control subjects. Monocyte CD11b expression was higher in patients with CVI than in control subjects (7.5 vs. 3.7; P <.01), with no differences noted in CD11b expression between patients with or without ulceration. Neutrophil CD11b expression was low and similar in control subjects and patients with CVI.\nAll classes of CVI are associated with significantly increased percentages of platelet-monocyte aggregates and increased percentages of platelet-neutrophil aggregates throughout the circulation. The presence of more of these aggregates and the increased propensity to form aggregates in the presence of platelet agonists in all classes of CVI suggests an underlying state of platelet activation and increased reactivity that is independent of the presence of ulceration. The increased expression of monocyte CD11b throughout the circulation in all classes of CVI suggests that although systemic monocyte activation occurs in CVI, its presence is independent of VSU as well.",

    "abstract": "Clinical and microscopic evidence suggests the existence of sensory neuropathy in patients with severe chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). A clinical evaluation was conducted to determine whether a sensory neuropathy was present and, if so, to determine its extent and distribution.\nThe study was performed in a university-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Twenty-three limbs were studied in 14 male veterans with mild or moderate CVI. The exclusions included diabetes, previous ipsilateral extremity surgery, or other diseases associated with neuropathy. Sensory thresholds in the limbs with CEAP class 2 disease (n = 11) were compared with the thresholds in the limbs with CEAP class 5 disease (n = 12) at nine different sites on the foot, ankle, calf, thigh, and palm. Thenar and hypothenar thresholds were measured as internal controls. Thresholds were determined by a pressure aesthesiometer consisting of 20 graduated filaments that ranged from 1.65 to 6.65 (log(10)mg)(10) of pressure. A complete, sensory motor assessment of the limb was performed by an experienced neurosurgeon who specialized in peripheral nerve evaluation. The clinical variables assessed were deep tendon reflexes, vibration, proprioception, and light touch. Venous reflux was determined with duplex ultrasound scanning and air plethysmography.\nSensory thresholds at the most common site of venous ulceration-just proximal to the medial malleolus--were significantly (P <.05) different between mild (class 2) and severe (class 5) CVI. Sensory abnormalities coincided with the extent of trophic changes and did not reflect specific dermatomal or cutaneous nerve distributions. In addition to light touch or pinprick, vibration sense and deep tendon reflexes were also significantly worse in those with severe CVI.\nSensory neuropathy is a feature of severe CVI, and its distribution is coincident with trophic changes. Because this is often unappreciated by the patient, it probably contributes to the propensity for deterioration from minor trauma.",

One subject was clinical class 4, one was class 2, two were class 1, and the remainder were class 0. The diameter of the posterior tibial, peroneal, and greater saphenous veins were measured at midcalf by means of bilateral duplex ultrasound scanning; calf circumference was measured at the same level. In addition, the number and caliber of all detectable medial calf perforating veins were recorded. Each subject was examined on two separate days, one while wearing the gradient stockings and one not wearing them. Baseline measurements were made on each day before the subjects began their workday, with follow-up measurements made after approximately 4.5 hours of normal activity.\nCalf circumference increased an average of 23.8 +/- 10.1 mm without stockings (P <.001) and decreased by 5.2 +/- 7.0 mm when wearing stockings (P =.003). The number of detected perforating veins increased without stockings by 1.8 +/- 2.0 at the follow-up examination (P =.002); with stockings, the change was 0.4 +/- 1.2 (P = NS).\nGraded compression elastic stockings help preserve lower leg venous caliber and tone throughout the deep, superficial, and perforating venous systems during normal ambulatory activity, and this may, in part, explain their beneficial effects.",

    "abstract": "A large multicenter study has recently questioned the overall clinical efficacy of vena caval filters, especially when inserted prophylactically, because of the subsequent development of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) at the insertion site. We examined the incidence of this complication with newer, smaller diameter percutaneous devices.\nWe reviewed our vascular surgery and interventional radiology clinical registries to identify patients in whom a femoral percutaneous vena caval filter had been placed from 1993 to 1998. This list was cross referenced with patients who had undergone lower extremity venous ultrasound scan examinations for the diagnosis of DVT in the vascular laboratory within a 60-day period before and after the insertion of the filter device.\nA total of 35 patients during this 5-year period had timely follow-up venous duplex scan studies performed. The indications for filter placement were DVT in 16 patients (46%), pulmonary embolus in 13 patients (37%), DVT and pulmonary embolus in three patients (9%), and prophylactically in three patients (9%) at high risk for thromboembolization. Of the patients with documented thromboembolic events, 91% (29 of 32) had contraindications to anticoagulation therapy, and the remaining 9% (3 of 32) represented failure of anticoagulation therapy. A Greenfield filter was used in 13 patients (37%), a Simon Nitinol filter was used in 11 patients (31%), and a VenaTech filter was used in nine patients (26%). The other two patients (6%) had a Bird's Nest filter inserted. At a mean follow-up period of 12 +/- 2 days (median, 6 days), there was a 40% (14 of 35) incidence of proximal DVT in venous segments without evidence of thrombus before filter insertion. The majority (71%; 10 of 14) occurred in the common femoral vein, with three located in the superficial femoral vein and one in the external iliac vein. The lowest incidence of DVT was seen with the Greenfield and Bird's Nest filters as compared with the smaller Simon Nitinol and VenaTech filters (20% vs 55%; P < .05). The highest incidence of thrombosis occurred in patients with pre-insertion pulmonary emboli (50%; 8 of 16) as compared with those patients with DVT (38%; 6 of 16) and prophylactic insertion (0%; 0 of 3). However, the subgroups were too small to attain statistical significance.\nThere is a continuing and significant incidence of new DVT development ipsilateral to the percutaneous femoral insertion site of vena caval filters.

In addition, all the patients underwent postoperative heparin therapy followed by oral warfarin therapy, adjusted in dose to maintain a goal international normalized ratio (INR) level of 2.0 to 3.0. Warfarin therapy and compression stockings were continued for 1 month after surgery. Bilateral duplex scanning was performed 1 and 4 weeks after surgery to assess the rate of DVT.\nNineteen of the 125 patients had DVT develop (15.2%). Of those thromboses, six (31.6%) and 13 (68%) were detected 1 week and 1 month after surgery, respectively. The rate of proximal DVT was 2.4% (3 of 125) 1 week after surgery and rose to 8.2% (10 of 122) 1 month after surgery. Most DVT cases (64%; 12 of 19) were asymptomatic. The patients in whom DVT developed had significantly lower INR values during the second to fourth postoperative weeks than did those patients without thrombosis, and no differences in INR values were found during the first postoperative week.\nThe risk of the development of DVT extends beyond hospital discharge in patients who undergo total hip replacement, despite a regimen of prolonged oral anticoagulation therapy. This is particularly true in patients whose INR values did not reach therapeutic range during the first postoperative month. Therefore, thrombosis prophylaxis regimens on the basis of the administration of warfarin should try to maintain INR values within therapeutic range during the entire first postoperative month to minimize the incidence of DVT.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the rate of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) resolution and DVT outcomes as functions of the level of oral anticoagulation therapy achieved with warfarin.\nIn 33 consecutive patients, a series of 35 limbs with acute symptomatic DVT was followed throughout 1 year of anticoagulation therapy. All the patients underwent 5 days of intravenous unfractionated sodium heparin therapy that was adjusted in dose to prolong the activated thromboplastin time to 2.0 to 2.5 times the control. In addition, warfarin was administered for a period of 6 months, with a target international normalized ratio (INR) between 2.0 and 3.0. All the patients underwent venous duplex scanning and physical examination at the time of diagnosis and at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.\nAt the end of the 1-year study period, the rate of complete DVT resolution was 68%. The median INR values in patients with complete DVT resolution were significantly higher than those of patients with incomplete DVT resolution after 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment with warfarin. In addition, the proportion of patients with INR values below therapeutic range was significantly higher in patients with incomplete DVT resolution than in patients with complete DVT resolution after 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment with warfarin. The presence of occlusive thrombi was associated with incomplete DVT resolution. Of the patients with occlusive thrombi, 62% had chronic venous insufficiency symptoms develop, whereas only 11% of the patients with nonocclusive thrombi (P =.003) had these symptoms develop.\nDespite 6 months of oral anticoagulant therapy, almost one third of thrombi did not resolve completely. The INR values were significantly higher in those patients with complete DVT resolution. These results suggest that the maintenance of an INR level between 2.0 and 3.0 throughout oral anticoagulation therapy will minimize the rate of incomplete DVT resolution.",

    "abstract": "The clinical diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is unreliable in more than 50% of cases, and, in recent years, plasma D-dimer assays have been used to predict the presence of DVT with high sensitivity and negative predictive values. This study investigated the use of a rapid whole blood test that could be performed and interpreted by the bedside in addition to a clinically derived risk assessment score (RAS) to determine whether a practical and cost-effective clinical model could be developed for the diagnosis and exclusion of DVT in symptomatic patients.\nTwo hundred consecutive patients who were referred to the vascular laboratory with clinically suspected DVT underwent the following procedures: (1) clinical assessment and stratification into low, moderate, or high risk for DVT on the basis of an RAS related to history, symptoms, and physical examination findings; (2) rapid (5-minute) whole blood D-dimer testing with a semi-qualitative agglutination technique on a fingerprick blood sample; and (3) color flow duplex ultrasound scanning with standard criteria for the diagnosis of proximal and calf DVT.\nForty-six patients (23%) had acute DVT on duplex ultrasound scanning. Of these cases, 28 (61%) had proximal DVT and 18 (39%) were confined to the calf. A total of 88 patients were classified as low risk, 67 were classified as moderate, and 45 were classified as high risk on the basis of the RAS method. Of the patients who were classified at low risk, 4.5% (4/88) had DVT, as compared with 17.9% (12/67) in the moderate clinical risk group and 66.7% (30/45) in the high risk group. Isolated calf DVT was found in 30% (9/30), 50% (6/12), and 75% (3/4) of the high, moderate, and low risk groups, respectively. The sensitivity (8.7%, 26.1%, 65.2%), specificity (45.5%, 64.3%, 90.3%), positive predictive value (4.5%, 17.9%, 66.7%), and overall accuracy rate (37%, 55.5%, 84.5%) of the low, moderate, and high risk groups, respectively, in the diagnosis of DVT increased significantly with increasing risk score stratification. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and overall accuracy of the rapid D-dimer test for all DVT were 91.3%, 81.9%, 60%, 96.9%, and 84%, respectively, with a 100% sensitivity and negative predictive value for proximal DVT. A combination of the RAS and D-dimer identified a low risk group with a negative D-dimer as having less than a 1% likelihood of DVT and a high risk group with positive D-dimer as having a likelihood of more than 90%.\nA combination of clinical assessment and rapid D-dimer testing provides an effective means of excluding proximal DVT in symptomatic patients. The application of a clinical diagnostic model on the basis of these parameters has the potential for saving a large proportion of unnecessary duplex scans with the associated time and costs.",

    "abstract": "In the search for calf deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with color-flow duplex scanning (CFDS), most vascular laboratories investigate only the posterior tibial and peroneal veins. Few laboratories assess the soleal and gastrocnemial veins. This study was designed to determine the patterns and distribution of isolated calf DVT, including the soleal and gastrocnemial veins.\nIn the last 3 years, 5250 patients (mean age, 66 +/- 15 years; range, 22 to 93 years) were referred to the vascular laboratory for clinical suspicion of DVT and underwent examination with CFDS. All superficial and deep named veins, excluding the anterior tibial from groin to ankle, were imaged. Of the deep veins in the calf, the peroneal, the posterior tibial, the gastrocnemial, and the soleal veins were examined throughout their length.\nDVT was detected in 14% of the patients. Isolated calf DVT was detected in 282 limbs of 251 patients (4.8%). No significant difference was noted for the sex (114 men vs 137 women; P =.15) or the limb preference (145 left vs 137 right; P =.5). The peroneal veins were most frequently involved, with 115 limbs (41%) affected. The soleal veins were involved in 109 limbs (39%), followed by the posterior tibial in 105 limbs (37%) and the gastrocnemial in 79 limbs (29%). Thrombus in the soleal vein alone was found in 57 limbs (20%), in the gastrocnemial in 48 limbs (17%), in the peroneal in 41 limbs (15%), and in the posterior tibial vein in 35 limbs (12%). Thrombus confined to a single or paired vein was found in 181 limbs (64%). Thrombus involving two different veins (27%) was the second most frequent pattern, and thrombus in three (7%) or four (1.4%) different veins was less prevalent. Isolated thrombosis in veins not routinely investigated was found in 113 limbs (40%; soleal, n = 57; gastrocnemial, n = 48; soleal + gastrocnemial, n = 8). Multifocal origin of thrombosis, defined as thrombi in two different veins that do not anatomically communicate, was identified in 63 limbs (22%).\nForty percent of the patients with acute isolated calf DVT would be judged to have normal CFDS examination results if the muscular veins in the calf were not imaged. Multifocal origin of thrombosis was found in 22% of the involved limbs. The prevalence of thrombosis in any calf vein either alone or in combination is comparable. Accordingly, the soleal and gastrocnemial veins should be examined routinely.",

    "abstract": "Pathologic dermal degeneration in patients with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is characterized by aberrant tissue remodeling that results in stasis dermatitis, tissue fibrosis, and ulcer formation. The cytochemical processes that regulate these events are unclear. Because transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) is a known fibrogenic cytokine, we hypothesized that the increased production of TGF-beta(1) would be associated with CVI disease progression.\nSeventy-eight punch biopsy specimens of the lower calf (LC) and the lower thigh (LT) of 52 patients were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stratified into four groups according to the Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery CEAP classification (C, clinical; E, etiologic; A, anatomic distribution; and P, pathophysiology). One set of LC biopsy specimens were analyzed for TGF-beta(1) gene expression with quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction: healthy skin, n = 6; class 4, n = 6; class 5, n = 5; and class 6, n = 7. A second set of biopsy specimens from the LC and LT were analyzed for the amount of bioactive TGF-beta(1) with a certified cell line 64 mink lung epithelial bioassay: healthy skin, n = 8; class 4, n = 23; class 5, n = 13; and class 6, n = 10. The location of TGF-beta(1) was determined at the light and electron microscopy level with immunocytochemistry and immunogold (IMG) labeling. Multiple comparisons were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc tests. The LC and LT comparisons were analyzed with a two-tailed unpaired t test.\nThe TGF-beta(1) gene transcripts for control subjects and patients in classes 4, 5, and 6 were 7.02 +/- 7.33, 43.33 +/- 9.0, 16.13 +/- 7.67, and 7.22 +/- 0.56 x 10(-14) mol/microg total RNA, respectively. The transcripts were significantly elevated in class 4 patients only (P </=.05). The amount of active TGF-beta(1) in picograms/gram of tissue from LC and LT biopsy specimens as compared with healthy skin biopsy specimens were as follows: healthy skin, <1. 0 pc/g; class 4: LC, 5061 +/- 1827 pc/g; LT, 317.3 +/- 277 pc/g; class 5: LC, 8327 +/- 3690 pc/g; LT, 193 +/- 164 pc/g; and class 6: LC, 5392 +/- 1800 pc/g; LT, 117 +/- 61 pc/g. Differences between healthy skin and the skin of the patients in classes 4 and 6 were significant (P </=.05 and P </=.01, respectively). Differences between the LC and LT biopsy specimens within each CVI group were also significant: class 4, P </=.003; class 5, P </=.008; and class 6, P </=.02. Immunocytochemistry results of healthy skin showed TGF-beta(1) staining of epidermal basal cells only. CVI dermal biopsy results demonstrated positive staining in epidermal basal cells, fibroblasts, and leukocytes. Many leukocytes had positive staining of intracellular granules, which appeared morphologically similar to mast cells. IMG labeling results demonstrated gold particles in the leukocytes and collagen fibrils of the extracellular matrix.\nOur study indicated that activated leukocytes traverse perivascular cuffs and release active TGF-beta(1). Positive TGF-beta(1) staining results of dermal fibroblasts were observed and suggest that fibroblasts are the targets of activated interstitial leukocytes. Increased protein production, despite normal levels of gene transcripts in patients in classes 5 and 6, suggests that alternate mechanisms other than gene transcription regulate protein production. A potential mechanism for quick access and release is storage of TGF-beta(1) in the extracellular matrix. IMG labeling to collagen fibrils support this possibility. Furthermore, TGF-beta(1) was exclusively elevated in areas of clinically active disease, indicating a regionalized response to injury. These data suggest that alterations in tissue remodeling occur in patients with CVI and that dermal tissue fibrosis in CVI is regulated by TGF-beta(1).",

    "abstract": "An elevated plasma homocysteine level has been identified as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. Whether this represents a marker for vascular disease or a direct effect on the vasculature remains unclear. Because vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play an integral role in the atherosclerotic process, we studied the effect of homocysteine on human infragenicular VSMC proliferation and the role of folic acid in reversing the homocysteine effect.\nHuman infragenicular VSMCs harvested from amputation specimens were studied. Various cell groups were exposed to physiologic (6.25 micromol/L and 12.5 micromol/L) and pathologic (25 micromol/L to 500 micromol/L) concentrations of homocysteine. Similar groups were simultaneously exposed to 20 nmol/L of folic acid. Cell counts and DNA synthesis, as reflected by [methyl-(3)H]-thymidine incorporation, were performed at 6 days and 24 hours, respectively. Additional groups were exposed to various combinations of folic acid (20 nmol/L), vitamin B(6) (145 nmol/L), and vitamin B(12) (0.45 nmol/L) in the presence of homocysteine (25, 50, and 250 micromol/L).\nHomocysteine resulted in a dose-dependent increase in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Cell counts increased significantly at homocysteine concentrations ranging from 25 micromol/L to 500 micromol/L (P <.05), with a maximal increase of 98% at 500 micromol/L of homocysteine. The addition of 20 nmol/L folic acid resulted in significant inhibition of cell proliferation at all homocysteine concentrations studied (P <.001). Maximal inhibition of 70% occurred in the cells exposed to 50 micromol/L of homocysteine. The increases in [methyl-(3)H]-thymidine incorporation ranged from 36% at 6 micromol/L homocysteine to a maximum of 247% at 500 micromol/L homocysteine. All increases were statistically significant (P <.05). The addition of 20 nmol/L folic acid resulted in significant inhibition of DNA synthesis (P <.002). Vitamins B(6) and B(12) did not demonstrate significant antiproliferative properties.\nA possible role of homocysteine in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions is through a direct proliferative effect on VSMCs in a dose-dependent fashion. Folic acid intake at levels available in dietary supplements may prove protective in hyperhomocysteinemia-induced atherosclerosis. Vitamins B(6) and B(12) alone do not appear to exhibit a substantial inhibitory effect in the setting of elevated homocysteine levels.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has become one of the most commonly performed vascular procedures, because of the beneficial outcome it has when compared with medical therapy alone and because of the anatomic accessibility of the artery. In cases of distal carotid occlusive disease, high cervical carotid bifurcation, and some reoperative cases, access to the distal internal carotid artery may limit surgical exposure and increase the incidence of cranial nerve palsies. Mandibular subluxation (MS) is recommended to provide additional space in a critically small operative field. We report our experience to determine and illustrate a preferred method of MS.\nTechniques for MS were selected based on the presence or absence of adequate dental stability and periodontal disease. All patients received general anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation before subluxation. Illustrations are provided to emphasize technical considerations in performing MS in 10 patients (nine men and one woman) who required MS as an adjunct to CEA (less than 1% of primary CEAs). Patients were symptomatic (n = 7) or asymptomatic (n = 3) and had high-grade stenoses demonstrated by means of preoperative arteriography.\nSubluxation was performed and stabilization was maintained by means of: Ivy loop/circumdental wiring of mandibular and maxillary bicuspids/cuspids (n = 7); Steinmann pins with wiring (n = 1); mandibular/maxillary arch bar wiring (n = 1); and superior circumdental to circummandibular wires (n = 1). MS was not associated with mandibular dislocation in any patient. No postoperative cranial nerve palsies were observed. Three patients experienced transient temporomandibular joint discomfort, which improved spontaneously within 2 weeks.\nSurgical exposure of the distal internal carotid artery is enhanced with MS and nasotracheal intubation. We recommend Ivy loop/circumdental wiring as the preferred method for MS. Alternative methods are used when poor dental health is observed.",

    "abstract": "Revascularization of the internal or external carotid arteries is occasionally indicated for symptomatic atherosclerotic common carotid artery occlusion or long-segment high-grade stenosis beginning at its origin. I report the outcome of axillary artery-based bypass grafts to the distal common, internal, or external carotid arteries.\nBetween 1981 and 1997, 29 axillary-to-carotid bypass grafting procedures were performed on 28 patients, 15 men and 13 women, with a mean age of 68 years. Indications were transient ischemia in nine patients, amaurosis fugax in four patients, completed stroke in six patients, and nonlateralizing global ischemia in nine patients. Twenty-three common carotid arteries were totally occluded, and six had long-segment stenosis of 90% or greater beginning at the origin. Saphenous vein grafts were used in 25 procedures, and synthetic grafts were used in four. Grafts were placed to 13 internal, eight distal common, and eight external carotid arteries.\nThere were no perioperative deaths; one stroke occurred (3.4%). No lymphatic or peripheral nerve complications occurred. In a 1- to 11-year follow-up period (mean, 4.5 years), there were no graft occlusions, one restenosis of 50% or greater, and two restenoses of 70% or greater. The 1-year stenosis-free rate for 50% or greater stenosis was 93%, and the 5- and 10-year rates were 87%. No late ipsilateral strokes occurred. The 5- and 10-year survival rates were 64% and 28%, respectively. Coronary artery disease was the major cause of late mortality.\nAxillary-to-carotid bypass grafting for severe symptomatic common carotid occlusive disease is safe, well tolerated, durable, and effective in stroke prevention.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the precise effect of smoking, duration of smoking, and cessation of smoking on the risk of the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nA nested case control study was carried out in a population-based screening program for men over the age of 50 years. Smoking data were collected by questionnaire, and serum levels of cotinine were used as an objective measure of nicotine exposure.\nData of 210 cases and 237 control individuals were analyzed. Current smokers were 7.6 times more likely to have an AAA than nonsmokers (95% confidence interval, 3.3%-17.8%). Exsmokers were 3.0 times more likely to have an AAA than nonsmokers (95% confidence interval, 1.4%-6.4%). Duration of smoking was significantly associated with an increased risk of AAA, and there was a clear linear dose response relationship with the duration of smoking; each year of smoking increased the relative risk of AAA by 4% (95% confidence interval, 2%-5%). In contrast, the effect of the amount smoked disappeared when an adjustment was made for the duration of smoking. After the cessation of smoking, there was a very slow decline in the risk of the occurrence of an AAA. Smoking was associated with a higher relative risk of a small aneurysm than a large aneurysm. Serum cotinine levels were higher in men with a small aneurysm than in men with a large aneurysm. Cotinine levels were similar in expanding aneurysms and stable aneurysms.\nThe duration of exposure rather than the level of exposure appears to determine the risk of the development of an AAA in men older than 50 years. The slow decline of risk after the cessation of smoking and the higher relative risk for small compared with large aneurysms suggest that smoking is an initiating event for the condition.",

All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) scans before operation, and 26 patients were followed up with a CT scan after a median of 36 months (range, 10 to 91 months).\nThe inflammatory layer resolved completely in only 23% of the patients.

    "abstract": "Arterial thromboembolism in patients with an unknown source of embolization is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The advent of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the more frequent use of computed tomography (CT) have led to the identification of mural aortic thrombi (MAT) as a source of distal embolization in a much higher proportion of patients than previously appreciated. The incidence, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with MAT is reported.\nIn a prospective study, from January 1996 to December 1998, 89 patients with acute embolic events underwent an extensive diagnostic workup, consisting of TEE, CT, or MRI, to detect the source of embolization. Patients in whom the heart (n = 51), occlusive aortoiliac disease (n = 16), or aortic aneurysms (n = 12) was identified as the source of embolization were excluded.\nFive female and three male patients, with a median age of 63 years (range, 35 to 76 years), with bilateral or repetitive embolic events resulting from MAT were identified, representing 9% of all patients with arterial thrombembolism. All patients had several risk factors for atherosclerosis, but only one young patient had a single risk factor that promoted thrombosis. Successful percutaneous catheter aspiration embolectomy was performed in six patients. The remaining two patients underwent surgical thromboembolectomy. A below-knee amputation had to be performed in two patients, thus representing a morbidity of the primary treatment of 25%. MAT of equal value were detected in the ascending (n = 1) and thoracic aorta (n = 3) by means of TEE, CT, or MRI. MAT in the abdominal aorta (n = 4) were identified by means of CT and MRI. Surgical removal of MAT was performed in seven patients by means of graft replacement of the ascending aorta (n = 1), open thrombectomy of the descending aorta (n = 2), and thrombendarterectomy of the abdominal aorta (n = 4), without intraoperative or postoperative complications. No recurrence of MAT occurred during a median follow-up period of 13 months (range, 4 to 24 months).\nMAT represent an important source of arterial thrombembolism. A diagnostic workup of the aorta, preferably by means of CT or MRI, should be performed in all patients in whom other sources of embolization have been ruled out. The ideal therapeutic approach to these patients still awaits prospective evaluation. However, based on our experience, MAT can be successfully treated with a definitive surgical procedure in selected patients, with low mortality and morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the choice of a vascular prosthesis for an extra-anatomic arterial bypass graft is left to the surgeon's preference because well-designed comparative evaluations have not been performed. The Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study 141 was organized to identify whether there is improved patency with different prosthetic grafts for patients with femorofemoral or axillofemoral bypass grafts.\nBetween June 1983 and June 1988, patients at 20 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers who had aortoiliac occlusive disease but were not considered suitable candidates for aortic bypass surgery were randomized to receive either an externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene or Dacron bypass graft for an extra anatomic bypass. Doppler-derived ankle brachial indices (ABIs) were determined before the operation and serially after the operation. Patients were seen in follow-up every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months thereafter. All patients were instructed to take 650 mg of aspirin each day for the duration of the study. A bypass graft was considered to be patent if the Doppler-derived postoperative ABI remained significantly improved (0.15 units above the preoperative value), and additional clinical information (such as subsequent ABIs, angiograms, or operations) did not contradict these observations.\nThree hundred forty patients with femorofemoral bypass grafts and 79 patients with axillofemoral or axillofemorofemoral bypass grafts were randomized. The indication for the bypass operation was limb salvage in 72% of the patients. The assisted primary patency rate for a Dacron bypass grafting was 79% at 1 year, 63% at 3 years, and 50% at 5 years; for polytetrafluoroethylene bypass grafting, the patency was 77% at 1 year, 62% at 3 years, and 47% at 5 years.\nThe overall results of this prospective randomized study suggest that the current choices of prosthetic bypass grafting have similar long-term patency in patients who undergo femorofemoral or axillofemoral vascular reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS) results in acceptable healing and recurrence rates. The role of hemodynamic venous testing in this situation, however, is poorly understood and inconsistently used. Our ongoing experience was reviewed to explore how SEPS affects the photoplethysmographic assessment of the leg.\nPreoperative and postoperative venous refill times (VRTs) were measured with photoplethysmography in 30 limbs in 28 patients who underwent SEPS and superficial ablation, when indicated, with complete clearing of the anterolateral surface of the tibia, thus opening the deep posterior compartment from mid calf to close to the malleolus. Postoperative healing and duplex scanning were used to assess clinical and anatomic success, respectively. The VRTs were classified as \"interpretable\" if the leg emptied or \"uninterpretable\" if the calf could not empty. The \"interpretable\" study results were further classified as \"normal\" if the refill took 20 seconds or more or \"abnormal\" if less.\nBefore the patients underwent SEPS, six study results (20%) showed inability of the calf to empty and thus were judged uninterpretable. After the patients underwent SEPS, 12 study results (40%) were uninterpretable (NS; P =.09 with the chi(2) test). Of the 24 preoperative interpretable study results, two (8%) were normal, and of the 18 postoperative interpretable study results, seven (39%) were normal (P <.03). With the consideration of only interpretable study results, the mean VRT increased slightly from 12.0 +/- 5.1 seconds (mean +/- standard deviation) to 14.3 +/- 8.1 seconds (NS). Seventeen of 19 ulcers (89%) had healed at a mean follow-up period of 8.6 +/- 4.8 months.\nAlthough VRT is unpredictably affected by SEPS, the most consistent finding is the inability of the calf to empty, which invalidates the remainder of the test. In addition, most ulcers heal, even with uninterpretable or abnormal postoperative VRTs. This suggests that photoplethysmography is a poor method of assessment of venous reflux after SEPS.",

    "abstract": "The evaluation of treatment strategies for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is assessed through the use of a reliable method of quantifying the extent of the thrombotic process. Previous indices of thrombus burden have suffered from various limitations, including lack of clinical relevance, poor correlation with actual thrombus mass, and failure to include important venous segments in the methodology. The use of a novel scheme of quantifying venous thrombus was evaluated as an alternative method that would avoid some of the drawbacks of existing indices.\nThe volumes of 14 venous segments (infrarenal inferior vena cava, common iliac, hypogastric, external iliac, common femoral, profunda, superficial femoral, and popliteal and six tibial veins) were calculated from computed tomography (pelvic vein diameter), duplex ultrasound scan (infrainguinal vein diameter), and contrast venography (length of all segments) measurements. A venous volumetric index (VVI) was assigned with the normalization of the values to the volume of a single calf vein. The VVI was validated with the assessment of the ability to discriminate between asymptomatic and symptomatic DVT and between those DVT that were associated with pulmonary emboli and those that were not.\nWith the imaging data, the VVI ranged from 1 for a single calf vein thrombus to 26 for the infrarenal inferior vena cava. Each VVI unit represented 2.3 mL of thrombus, with a maximum possible score of 63 representing a thrombus burden of 145 mL for a single extremity, including the infrarenal inferior vena cava. In 885 patients with DVT, the VVI ranged from 1 to 56, averaging 3.9 +/- 0.2 in patients who were asymptomatic and 8.7 +/- 0.3 in patients who were symptomatic (P <.001). The VVI was similar in the patients with pulmonary emboli as compared with those without (9.6 +/- 1.2 vs 7.7 +/- 0.2, respectively). In comparison with the three existing methods of quantifying venous thrombus burden, the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis results suggested that the VVI and the Venous Registry index were better than the other two indices in the discrimination of patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic DVT (P <.001).\nA novel index of venous thrombus burden, on the basis of actual venous volume measurements, was more accurate than present indices in the differentiation between clinical categories of patients with DVT. As such, it offers an acceptable alternative to current scoring systems.",

    "abstract": "The compression of femoral artery pseudoaneurysms is a time consuming, painful, and sometimes unsuccessful procedure. Thrombin injection has been advocated as a superior alternative. In this study, we compare our experiences with both techniques.\nAll the records of femoral artery false aneurysms that were treated in the vascular laboratory from January 1996 to April 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. Treatment with ultrasound scan-guided compression was compared with treatment with dilute thrombin injection (100 U/mL).\nBoth groups had similar demographics and aneurysm sizes (P >.2). Of the pseudoaneursyms, 88% were caused by cardiac catheterization and the others were the results of femoral artery access for cardiac surgery (6%), arteriography (5%), and renal dialysis (1%). Compression was successful in 25 of 40 patients (63%). Nine persistent aneurysms necessitated operation, and six were treated successfully with thrombin injection. Primary thrombin injection successfully obliterated 21 pseudoaneurysms in 23 patients. Overall, 27 of 29 pseudoaneurysms were treated successfully with thrombin injection (93%). Thrombosis occurred within seconds of the thrombin injection and required, on average, 300 units of thrombin (100 to 600 units). The patients who underwent successful compression required an average of 37 minutes of compression (range, 5 to 70 minutes) and required analgesia on several occasions. No patients in the thrombin group required analgesia or sedation. Neither group had complications. A cost analysis shows that thrombin treatment results in considerable savings in vascular laboratory resource use but not in overall hospital expenditures.\nUltrasound scan-guided thrombin injection is a safe, fast, and painless procedure that completely obliterates femoral artery pseudoaneurysms. The shift from compressive therapy to thrombin injection reduces vascular laboratory use and is less expensive, although it does not significantly impact hospital costs.",

    "abstract": "High-dose external radiotherapy used in the treatment of head and neck carcinoma has been implicated as a risk factor for accelerated atherosclerotic disease of the carotid arteries. However, how radiotherapy affects atherosclerotic disease is controversial, and little data exist to demonstrate a strong relationship between radiotherapy and progressive carotid disease.\nWe performed a retrospective chart review of 69 patients (all men) who underwent duplex ultrasound scanning examinations for carotid disease between 1993 and 1998. Twenty-three patients had received high-dose radiotherapy for the treatment of head and neck carcinoma within the past 12 years (group 1; mean age, 67.8 years), and 46 patients were randomly selected as age-matched control subjects (group 2; mean age, 68.3 years). The mean radiation dose was 6060 +/- 182 rads, and the average interval between radiotherapy and ultrasound scanning was 6. 5 +/- 1.8 years. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the presence of these comorbidities: diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertension, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease, or stroke. Similarly, there was no difference in the indications for the duplex scanning studies.\nFive of the 23 patients in group 1 (21. 7%) were found to have advanced carotid disease (70% to 99% stenosis); four patients were symptomatic, three patients went on to endarterectomy, and one patient was awaiting surgery. Two of the 46 patients in the control group (4%) had advanced carotid disease. One patient was symptomatic, and both patients underwent endarterectomy. A significant difference in the prevalence of advanced disease between the two groups was noted (P =.037). Sixteen patients who survived irradiation underwent a second duplex scanning study and had evidence of progressive disease with significant increases in peak systolic velocities.\nHigh-dose radiotherapy to the head and neck region may be a significant risk factor for accelerated carotid atherosclerotic disease. Routine carotid duplex surveillance may be warranted in this high-risk patient population.",

    "abstract": "Although percutaneous angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) of carotid bifurcation lesions is feasible and appropriate for surgically inaccessible lesions, its general role and comparative value remain unclarified. Moreover, the acceptance of carotid PTAS has been limited by its potential for producing embolic debris. This study used an ex vivo model to evaluate the efficacy of a novel filter device to entrap emboli during PTAS of human carotid plaques.\nEight carotid bifurcation plaques were obtained from patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy for high-grade atherosclerotic stenosis (>90%). The mean age of the patients was 63 years, and six patients were symptomatic. Each plaque was encased with polytetrafluoroethylene material to simulate adventitia and was connected to a perfusion circuit, which provided continuous flow through the plaque. The filter device consisted of an expandable polymeric membrane with multiple micro pores that was attached to the distal end of a 0.014-in wire with a shapeable tip. This filter was encased in a delivery catheter. With fluoroscopic guidance, the filter wire was passed through the stenosis and the delivery catheter was then retracted to open the filter to capture particles released into the distal internal carotid artery. PTAS with a self-expandable stent then was carried out over the filter wire. The particles released during the initial filter passage, those captured in the filter, and those that flowed through or around the filter (missed) were collected and analyzed with light microscopy.\nFilter deployment, PTAS, and filter retrieval were achieved successfully with each lesion. Because the filter has a low crossing profile, it passed through the stenoses smoothly and only produced occasional small particles. PTAS improved the angiographic stenosis from 96.2% +/- 3.7% to 1.3% +/- 1.6%. The mean number and the maximum size of the particles that were released during initial filter passage, missed, and captured by the filter device were 3.1 and 500 microm, 2.8 and 360 microm, 20.1 and 1100 microm, respectively. Most of the particles and those of large size were released during PTAS. The filter captured 88% of these particles.\nThese study results show that this filter device, at least in this model, did not add complexity to the interventional procedure itself. Furthermore, the filter may markedly decrease embolic events during carotid PTAS and expand the indications for this procedure.",

The mean number and the maximum size of the particles that were released during initial filter passage, missed, and captured by the filter device were 3.1 and 500 microm, 2.8 and 360 microm, 20.1 and 1100 microm, respectively. Most of the particles and those of large size were released during PTAS. The filter captured 88% of these particles.",

    "abstract": "Recently published data from the North American Carotid Endarterectomy Trial revealed a benefit for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in symptomatic patients with moderate (50% to 69%) carotid stenosis. This benefit was significant but small (absolute stroke risk reduction at 5 years, 6.5%; 22.2% vs 15.7%), and thus, the authors of this study were tentative in the recommendation of operation for these patients. To better elucidate whether CEA in symptomatic patients with moderate carotid stenosis is a proper allocation of societal resources, we examined the cost-effectiveness of this intervention.\nA decision-analytic Markov process model was constructed to determine the cost-effectiveness of CEA versus medical treatment for a hypothetical cohort of 66-year-old patients with moderate carotid stenosis. This model allowed the comparison of not only the immediate hospitalization but also the lifetime costs and benefits of these two strategies. Our measure of outcome was the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER), defined as the incremental lifetime cost per quality-adjusted life year saved. We assumed an operative stroke and death rate of 6.6% and a declining risk of ipsilateral stroke after the ischemic event with medical treatment (first year, 9.3%; second year, 4%; subsequent years, 3%). The hospitalization cost of CEA ($6,420) and the annual costs of major stroke ($26,880), minor stroke ($798), and aspirin therapy ($63) were estimated from a hospital cost accounting system and the literature.\nCEA for moderate carotid stenosis increased the survival rate by 0.13 quality-adjusted life years as compared with medical treatment at an additional lifetime cost of $580. Thus, CEA was cost-effective with a CER of $4,462. Society is usually willing to pay for interventions with CERs of less than $60,000 (eg, CERs for coronary artery bypass grafting at $9,100 and for dialysis at $53,000). CEA was not cost-effective if the perioperative risk was greater than 11.3%, if the ipsilateral stroke rate associated with medical treatment at 1 year was reduced to 4.3%, if the age of the patient exceeded 83 years, or if the cost of CEA exceeded $13,200.\nCEA in patients with symptomatic moderate carotid stenosis of 50% to 69% is cost-effective. Perioperative risk of stroke or death, medical and surgical stroke risk, cost of CEA, and age are important determinants of the cost-effectiveness of this intervention.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare clinical outcome and costs for two widely used treatment strategies for hemodialysis graft thrombosis.\nDuring a 4-year period, 80 patients with thrombosed dialysis grafts were randomly assigned to surgical thrombectomy with or without graft revision (SURG) or thrombolytic therapy with urokinase with the pulse-spray technique (ENDO), with adjunctive percutaneous transluminal angioplasty as indicated. All the procedures were performed in an endovascular operating suite with fistulography. The clinical and cost data were tabulated, and the outcome was analyzed with the life-table method.\nFifty-six women and 24 men ranged in age from 33 to 90 years (mean, 63.7 years). The patients had undergone a mean of 2.8 prior access procedures in the ipsilateral extremity. All the grafts were upper extremity expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Lesions that were presumed to be the primary cause of graft thrombosis were identified in 73 of 80 grafts, and 60 of these were at the venous anastomosis. The procedure time averaged 99 minutes for the patients in the SURG group and 113 minutes for the patients in the ENDO group (P =.12). Eleven patients in the ENDO group crossed over to surgical revision as compared with two patients in the SURG group who required adjunctive percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (P =.005). The mean cost of treatment (including room and supply costs but not professional fees) was significantly higher for the ENDO group than for the SURG group ($2945 vs $1512; P <.001). There were no procedure-related complications in either group. At a median follow-up time of 24 months, there was no difference in primary or assisted primary patency between groups, which averaged 6 and 7 months, respectively.\nAlthough thrombolytic therapy combined with endovascular treatment can extend the life of dialysis grafts with results similar to surgical revision, there is a high rate of technical failure necessitating surgery and a substantially higher cost for thrombolysis.",

    "abstract": "Mycotic pseudoaneurysms (MPA) remain challenging clinical problems. Primary surgical management includes control of hemorrhage and debridement of the infected arterial wall. Because critical ischemia may develop after arterial resection, revascularization has been a secondary goal of treatment. Standard anatomic graft placement or prosthetic bypass grafting has been compromised by a high rate of recurrent infection. Extra-anatomic reconstruction is preferred, with the basic goals being threefold: (1) the use of autogenous graft material to reduce the risk of reinfection; (2) the avoidance of significant size mismatches; and (3) graft placement that is anatomically inaccessible, because drug abuse causes many of these lesions. This study reviews a recent series of MPAs applying these treatment goals.\nIn a 2-year period, the superficial femoral and proximal popliteal veins were used in the repair of eight MPAs of the common femoral (5), common iliac (1), and brachial (1) arteries, and the infrarenal aorta (1). Most patients (5 of 7) were known intravenous drug users, who had a painful pulsatile mass in an injection area. Two patients had systemic sepsis, one patient with an infected common iliac pseudoaneurysm and one patient with an MPA of the infrarenal aorta. The diagnosis of MPA was made by means of duplex/computed tomography scanning and confirmed by means of arteriography in all cases.\nObturator bypass grafting was performed by using a reversed deep leg vein in the five femoral MPAs. An ilioiliac, cross-pelvic bypass grafting procedure with a deep vein was used to repair an MPA of the common iliac artery. A deep vein was also used as a \"pantaloon\" aortobiiliac graft and for a brachial artery repair. Staphylococcus aureus was revealed by means of cultures in nearly all cases. Distal arterial perfusion was normal after reconstruction. Patients had no significant postoperative leg swelling. No new venous thrombosis below the level of deep vein harvest was revealed by means of duplex scanning. There were no septic complications.\nThe superficial femoral/popliteal veins may be particularly useful for limb revascularization in patients with MPAs. This autogenous conduit provides an excellent size-match and a suitable length for reconstruction, because peripheral, axial arteries are generally affected. No clinically significant limb morbidity was related to deep vein removal. Late follow-up is challenging in such cases, but will be required to accurately determine the durability of this strategy.",

    "abstract": "The safety and efficacy of conventional abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair are undergoing increased examination in parallel with the development of less invasive repair methods. Because most published studies of elective AAA repair report operations performed in tertiary referral institutions and thus may not reflect the outcome in the surgical community at large, the current population-based study was undertaken to document the results obtained across a broad spectrum of clinical practice in a defined geographic area and to examine the factors that influence the outcomes.\nThe Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission database was used to identify all the elective AAA repairs that were performed in all the nonfederal acute care hospitals in the state from 1990 to 1995.\nElective AAA repair was performed on 2335 patients (mean age, 70.4 years) in 46 of the 52 (88%) nonfederal acute care hospitals in the state, including seven high-volume (>100 cases), nine moderate-volume (50 to 99 cases), and 30 low-volume (<50 cases) institutions. The in-hospital mortality rate was 3.5% and increased significantly with advancing age: less than 65 years, 2.2%; 65 to 69 years, 2.5%; 70 to 79 years, 3.5%; and more than 80 years, 7.3% (P =.002). Mortality rates were higher for women (4.5% vs 3.2%; P =.17), for blacks (6.7% vs 3.2%; P =.046), and for patients with renal failure (11.8% vs 3. 4%; P =.11) but not for patients with hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and pulmonary disease. The operative mortality rate was inversely correlated with hospital volume (4.3% in low-volume hospitals, 4.2% in moderate-volume hospitals, and 2.5% in high-volume hospitals; P =.08), although no differences were noted in the mean ages or comorbidity levels of patients who underwent operations in these three hospital populations. The operative mortality rate was inversely correlated with the experience of the individual surgeon: one case, 9.9%; two to nine cases, 4.9%; 10 to 49 cases, 2.8%; 50 to 99 cases, 2.9%; and more than 100 cases, 3.8% (P =.01). Multivariate analysis results identified patient age (P =. 002), low hospital volume (P =.039), and very low surgeon volume (P =.01) as independent predictors of operative mortality. The mean length of stay and mean hospital charges were 10.6 days and $17,589 and decreased with increasing surgeon volume: one case, 22.7 days/$32,800; two to nine cases, 10.6 days/$18,509; 10 to 49 cases, 10.0 days/$16,611; 50 to 99 cases, 10.9 days/$17,843; and more than 100 cases, 9.6 days/$16,682 (P <.0001/P <.0001).\nElective AAA repair is a safe procedure in contemporary practice in Maryland. Operative risk is increased among the elderly and when operations are performed by surgeons with very low volumes or in low-volume hospitals. Hospital lengths of stay were shorter and charges were lower when elective AAA repair was performed by surgeons with higher volumes.",

Mortality rates were higher for women (4.5% vs 3.2%; P =.17), for blacks (6.7% vs 3.2%; P =.046), and for patients with renal failure (11.8% vs 3. 4%; P =.11) but not for patients with hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and pulmonary disease. The operative mortality rate was inversely correlated with hospital volume (4.3% in low-volume hospitals, 4.2% in moderate-volume hospitals, and 2.5% in high-volume hospitals; P =.08), although no differences were noted in the mean ages or comorbidity levels of patients who underwent operations in these three hospital populations. The operative mortality rate was inversely correlated with the experience of the individual surgeon: one case, 9.9%; two to nine cases, 4.9%; 10 to 49 cases, 2.8%; 50 to 99 cases, 2.9%; and more than 100 cases, 3.8% (P =.01). Multivariate analysis results identified patient age (P =. 002), low hospital volume (P =.039), and very low surgeon volume (P =.01) as independent predictors of operative mortality. The mean length of stay and mean hospital charges were 10.6 days and $17,589 and decreased with increasing surgeon volume: one case, 22.7 days/$32,800; two to nine cases, 10.6 days/$18,509; 10 to 49 cases, 10.0 days/$16,611; 50 to 99 cases, 10.9 days/$17,843; and more than 100 cases, 9.6 days/$16,682 (P <.0001/P <.0001).",

    "abstract": "The use of a limited incision for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair was evaluated, and its outcome was analyzed in comparison to laparoscopic-assisted and standard open repair.\nEleven patients who had an AAA that required a tube graft underwent minimal incision (MINI) repair. The procedure consisted of a standard endoaneurysmorrhaphy performed through an 8- to 10-cm minilaparotomy. Clinical characteristics, in-hospital outcomes, and total in-hospital charges for this procedure were then compared with those of comparative groups of patients who had undergone repair of AAA by means of a laparoscopic-assisted (LAP) approach or a standard open (OPEN) technique.\nMINI repair was successfully completed in all 11 patients. Patients in the three groups were comparable for age, sex, risk factors, and aortic dimensions. The mean values for operative time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and total hospital charges for the three comparison groups were: 129. 7 minutes (MINI) vs. 244.8 minutes (LAP)*, 209.9 minutes (OPEN)*; 522.7 mL (MINI) vs. 1214.7 mL (LAP), 1795.8 mL (OPEN)*; 5.18 days (MINI) vs. 18.7 days (LAP), 17.4 days (OPEN); $22,692 (MINI) vs. $59, 922 (LAP)*, $62,324 (OPEN)* (*P <.05). Local complications occurred in 18.2% of patients who underwent MINI repair, 23.5% of patients who underwent LAP repair, and 29.7% of patients who underwent OPEN repair (P = not significant). Patients undergoing minilaparotomy demonstrated decreased compromise of gastrointestinal function, with a decreased need for postoperative fluid resuscitation (6799.7 mL [MINI], 7781.8 mL [LAP] vs. 11061.1 mL [OPEN]*) and shortened nasogastric tube decompression (1.6 days [MINI], 1.5 days [LAP] vs. 4.1 days [OPEN]*; *P <.05).\nMINI repair is a technically feasible technique that combines the benefits of minimally invasive surgery with those of conventional open repair with few, if any disadvantages. Facility of the procedure, combined with the potential cost benefits, encourages further study for consideration of this technique as a viable alternative for the management of AAAs.",

    "abstract": "The goal of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is the prevention of rupture. Exclusion of the infrarenal AAA by means of operation or endovascular graft placement is an alternative therapy to achieve this goal. However, thrombosis of the excluded aneurysm sac does not always occur and further intervention may be needed. This study examines the efficacy of available screening methods to detect the persistence of aneurysm sac flow and the outcome of secondary procedures to treat this problem.\nDuring the past 14 years, 1218 patients have undergone operative retroperitoneal exclusion of AAA. To date, 48 patients have been found to have persistent flow in the excluded AAA sac with duplex scanning. Twenty-seven patients underwent surgical intervention, and seven of these procedures were performed for rupture. Six patients have undergone treatment with interventional techniques (four successfully). The patients were evaluated for preoperative angiographic, anatomic, and comorbid factors that may have predisposed them to failed exclusion. Also, perioperative morbidity and mortality, estimated blood loss, and survival were assessed in the patients who required surgical treatment.\nThere were no perioperative parameters that correlated with postoperative persistent flow in the excluded AAA sac. The mean time to secondary intervention was 51 months (range, 2 to 113 months). Two patients had false-negative computed tomographic angiogram results, eight patients had false-negative angiogram results, and six patients had duplex scan examinations that had initially negative results that were then positive for flow in sac. Reoperation had a 7.4% mortality rate (two deaths) and a median blood loss of 2600 mL, as compared with 500 mL for primary procedures.\nSecondary operations for patent excluded aortic aneurysm sacs have higher mortality and intraoperative blood loss rates than do primary procedures for AAA repair. The localization of branch leaks with computerized tomographic angiography, angiography, and duplex scanning were imprecise, and better methods are needed to adequately diagnose patent sacs. Expansion of AAA sac may be the only reliable factor.",
