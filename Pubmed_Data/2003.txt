Studies of competing methods of treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms greater than 5 cm are used as a clinical example of interest to the readers of this Journal. Rather than actually conducting such an analysis with existing data, we describe the principles for conducting or reviewing an economic analysis with factitious data.",

    "abstract": "Thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair continues to be associated with a significant risk of operative complications, many of which are related to the prolonged period of aortic cross clamping inherent in the procedure. A variety of adjuvant techniques have been used in attempts to decrease morbidity, including atriofemoral extracorporal bypass, subarachnoid drainage, epidural cooling, and preliminary axillofemoral bypass. Herein is described a method to maintain distal perfusion with a side-arm conduit, originating from the most proximal aspect of the aortic graft and terminating on the left iliac artery. The technique has the potential to minimize hemodynamic instability while decreasing the period of pelvic and lower extremity ischemia and simplifying reattachment of aortic branch vessels. This method provides another option that can be considered in these technically demanding operative procedures.",

Several surgical options have been described for DASS correction. To achieve an adequate distribution of the blood flow towards the fistula and the hand, intraoperative duplex ultrasound scan monitoring was used in this preliminary communication to control the surgical reduction of volume flow through the fistula. The shunt flow was not estimated with direct insonation of the shunt but calculated from the difference of the bilateral subclavian artery volume flow rates. This new technique has several advantages over a direct shunt evaluation that are discussed in this report. Three patients with DASS are described in whom the technique was successfully applied and led to a normalization of the hand perfusion and to the maintenance of a long-term patency of the fistula.",

As a minimally invasive procedure, videoendoscopy has been shown to improve the patient postoperative course and comfort in the field of general and thoracic surgery.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to simultaneously monitor the transcriptional levels of 12 endothelial growth factor genes in response to alterations in wall shear stress (WSS) under conditions relevant to the development of intimal hyperplasia, a major cause of arterial bypass graft failure.\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells were preconditioned in vitro under steady flow (WSS, 15 dynes/cm(2)) for 24 hours before being subjected to WSS at 25 (Delta = +10), 15 (Delta = 0), 5 (Delta = -10), 2.5 (Delta = -12.5), and 0 (Delta = -15) dynes/cm(2) or low magnitude WSS reversal (-2.5 dynes/cm(2)) for 6 hours. A focused complementary DNA array was used to simultaneously measure messenger RNA expression levels for END1, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), platelet-derived growth factor A, platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB), acidic fibroblast growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta, vascular endothelial growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, epidermal growth factor, and angiotensin converting enzyme.\nPreconditioning significantly (P <.05) increased the fold expression of NOS3 (4.1 +/- 1.4), basic fibroblast growth factor (3.90 +/- 1.16), vascular endothelial growth factor (3.39 +/- 1.04), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (2.8 +/- 0.7) but decreased END1 (0.47 +/- 0.05) and PDGFB (0.70 +/- 0.04) messenger RNA expression levels relative to no-flow controls, an effect that was sustained on removal from flow for 6 hours. Notably, the ratio of END1/NOS3 expression was diminished (0.11 +/- 0.03) relative to that of cells maintained in static culture. Although few differences in gene expression from baseline (15 dynes/cm(2)) were measured in cells exposed to either constant (Delta = 0) or step decreases (Delta = -10, -12.5, or -15 dynes/cm(2)) in WSS, marked changes were seen in the group exposed to a step increase in WSS (Delta = +10) or to WSS reversal. Low magnitude retrograde WSS evoked significant (P <.05) transcriptional changes in multiple genes, including elevated END1 (4.1 +/- 0.5), platelet-derived growth factor A (1.5 +/- 0.2), PDGFB (2.3 +/- 0.3), and transforming growth factor-beta (1.5 +/- 0.2) levels, but depressed NOS3 (0.60 +/- 0.17) levels, and a marked increase in END1/NOS3 (6.7 +/- 1.6) when compared with equal magnitude antegrade WSS (2.5 dynes/cm(2)).\nThese results support the implementation of a preconditioning phase for in vitro WSS studies to establish a physiologic baseline. Our findings complement previous macroscale findings and are consistent with a cellular mechanism involving increased END1 and PDGFB levels, but decreased NOS3 levels, leading to intimal hyperplasia at regions of low magnitude reversing WSS.",

    "abstract": "Pseudoaneurysm is a known complication of arteriovenous grafts in chronic hemodialysis and can result in graft disruption or thrombosis if left untreated. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of endovascular repair with Wallgraft endoprosthesis (Boston Scientific, Inc, Watertown, Mass) in a porcine arteriovenous graft (AVG) pseudoaneurysm model.\nBilateral groin AVG pseudoaneurysms (n = 18) were created with an oversized Dacron interposition graft within a polytetrafluoroethylene femoral AVG in nine domestic swine and allowed to mature 28 +/- 4 days (standard deviation). Transluminal placement of Wallgraft was performed to exclude the pseudoaneurysm from the AVG circulation. Hemodialysis was performed (400 mL/min x 1 hour, with intravenous heparin 30 units/kg) every 4 days for a total of 6 weeks via 15-gauge needles in the treated AVG pseudoaneurysm site. Arteriography and duplex ultrasound scan were performed to determine AVG patency and pseudoaneurysm flow. Histologic evaluation was performed to determine Wallgraft morphology. In vitro pulsatile flow chamber was used to determine maximal flow volume without peri-Wallgraft endoleak.\nAll AVG pseudoaneurysms were successfully excluded with the Wallgrafts. Twelve AVG (67%) remained patent at the completion of the study. No Wallgraft migration occurred from hemodialysis. Transient peri-Wallgraft endoleak (<2 hours after hemodialysis) was present in 13 of 18 (72%) and four of 12 (33%) AVG pseudoaneurysms by weeks 1 and 6, respectively. With maintenance of an intraluminal pressure of 80, 100, 120, 140, and 160 mm Hg in the pulsatile flow chamber, the maximal flow rates without peri-Wallgraft endoleak were 625 +/- 120, 650 +/- 145, 620 +/- 95, 425 +/- 110, and 262 +/- 86 mL/min. Scanning electron microscopy showed a neointimal layer covered with thrombus on the Wallgraft surface.\nEndoluminal placement of Wallgraft endoprosthesis provides adequate structural support for continuous hemodialysis after AVG pseudoaneurysm exclusion. Transient blood flow in the pseudoaneurysm cavity may occur immediately after the hemodialysis, which may represent the effect of heparin used during hemodialysis. This study suggests Wallgraft is a safe and effective treatment for AVG pseudoaneurysm and permits continuous hemodialysis.",

With maintenance of an intraluminal pressure of 80, 100, 120, 140, and 160 mm Hg in the pulsatile flow chamber, the maximal flow rates without peri-Wallgraft endoleak were 625 +/- 120, 650 +/- 145, 620 +/- 95, 425 +/- 110, and 262 +/- 86 mL/min. Scanning electron microscopy showed a neointimal layer covered with thrombus on the Wallgraft surface.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not infection of prosthetic vascular graft could be prevented with the placement of antibiotic-loaded porous apatite ceramic on the graft with bacterial contamination.\nTeicoplanin as an antibiotic was loaded into a beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) block of porous apatite ceramic. The activity of teicoplanin released from teicoplanin-loaded TCP was examined for 40 days at 2-day intervals. In an in vivo study, the graft was patched in the abdominal aorta of a rabbit. Two different doses of Staphylococcus aureus were applied (n = 13). Teicoplanin-loaded TCP was placed around the graft infected with S aureus (n = 6). The graft, the tissue around it, and the arterial blood were collected and cultivated 4 weeks after operation.\nThe activity of teicoplanin in the replaced saline solution was maintained for at least 40 days. Because graft infection was established in all rabbits with a dose of 2 x 10(7) colony forming units, this dose was used as the dose of S aureus in this study. Fifty-seven percent of the subjects died from the infection. When teicoplanin-loaded TCP was placed around the graft contaminated with S aureus, no rabbits died. Bacterial cultures of the graft and of tissues around it were negative in all rabbits killed 4 weeks after operation. This infection was prevented with teicoplanin-loaded TCP in all rabbits.\nTeicoplanin-loaded TCP may be useful in avoiding Dacron graft infection with S aureus in rabbits.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism with which fluid flow inhibits endothelial E-selectin expression.\nCultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells were stimulated with inflammatory agonists (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha], interleukin-1beta, oncostatin M, or phorbol ester) in the presence or absence of fluid flow (peak shear stress, approximately 12 dynes/cm(2)) imposed with an orbital shaker. E-selectin expression was assessed with ribonuclease protection assay, immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or metabolic labeling as appropriate.\nAll agonists caused human umbilical vein endothelial cells to express E-selectin protein. Fluid flow inhibited E-selectin protein levels by about 50% in response to TNF-alpha but had no effect on total E-selectin messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. Flow inhibited E-selectin protein production even after initiation of E-selectin transcription. Flow did not cause E-selectin to be shed from the cell surface nor was E-selectin degradation accelerated. Although fluid flow did not reduce total cellular E-selectin mRNA levels in response to TNF-alpha, the amount of E-selectin mRNA present in the actively translated polysome fraction was markedly attenuated.\nThese findings indicate that E-selectin expression is subject to translational and transcriptional control. Fluid mechanical forces can regulate endothelial phenotype by targeting translational control points.",

The aorta was kept cross clamped without perfusion for a subsequent 20 minutes. In group B (n = 6), the infrarenal aorta was segmentally cross clamped and the segment was perfused for 5 minutes with blood and saline solution containing PGE1 of 100 ng/kg/min at first. The aorta was kept cross clamped without perfusion for a subsequent 20 minutes. After the aorta was declamped, the experimental animals recovered from the anesthesia. Twenty-four and 48 hours after the operation, the hind limb function was estimated with Tarlov's grade. Then, the animals were killed for pathologic study.\nThe systolic arterial pressures measured at the left common carotid artery through the experiment were not significantly different between the two groups. The perfusion of the aortic segment between the proximal and distal clamp was nonpulsatile. The perfusion pressures of the aortic segments at 5 minutes after aortic cross clamping were 29 +/- 6 mm Hg and 33 +/- 6 mm Hg in groups A and B, respectively. No significant differences were seen between the two groups. In group A, the hind limb functions evaluated with Tarlov's grade after 24 hours and 48 hours were 0 to 3 (1.5 +/- 1.4) and 0 to 3 (1.3 +/- 1.4), respectively. In group B, these were 3 to 4 (3.5 +/- 0.5) and 3 to 4 (3.7 +/- 0.5), respectively. A significant difference was seen between the two groups (P <.05).

    "abstract": "Controversy still exists whether polytetrafluoroethylene is equivalent to vein as bypass graft material for the above-knee femoropopliteal bypass. Therefore, a prospective randomized trial was performed to compare vein with polytetrafluoroethylene for femoropopliteal bypasses with the distal anastomosis above the knee.\nBetween January 1993 and December 1996, 151 above-knee femoropopliteal bypasses were performed. The indications for operation were severe claudication in 120 cases, rest pain in 20 cases, and ulceration in 11 cases. After randomization, 75 reversed saphenous venous bypasses and 76 polytetrafluoroethylene bypasses were performed.\nNo perioperative mortality was seen, and 5% of the patients had minor infections of the wound, not resulting in loss of the bypass, the limb, or life. After 5 years, 38% of the patients had died and 7% were lost to follow-up. Only once was the saphenous vein necessary for coronary artery bypass grafting. Primary patency rates after 5 years were 75.6% for venous bypass grafts and 51.9% for polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (P =.035). Secondary patency rates were 79.7% for vein and 57.2% for polytetrafluoroethylene bypasses (P =.036). In the venous group, 14 bypasses failed, leading to five new bypasses. In the polytetrafluoroethylene group, 29 bypasses failed, leading to 16 reinterventions. For these 16 new bypasses, in four cases, the ipsilateral preserved saphenous vein was used. In both groups, one above-knee amputation and one below-knee amputation had to be performed.\nWe conclude after 5 years of follow-up of this randomized controlled trial that a bypass with saphenous vein has better patency rates at all intervals and needs fewer reoperations. Saphenous vein should be the graft material of choice for above-knee femoropopliteal bypasses and should not be preserved for reinterventions. Polytetrafluoroethylene is an acceptable alternative if the saphenous vein is not available.",

This randomized multicenter study was performed to assess the patency rates and the effect of 4-mm to 7-mm grafts on the development of stenoses.\nA total of 109 patients who needed vascular access for hemodialysis were randomized to receive either 6-mm (n = 57) or 4-mm to 7-mm prosthetic brachial-antecubital forearm loop accesses (polytetrafluoroethylene). Duplex scanning, with measurement of blood flow and peak systolic velocity and detection of stenoses (>50%), was performed at 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Clinical data were obtained in a prospective manner and primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis. Statistical analysis was performed with the independent samples t test and chi(2) test.\nAt 1 year, patency rates were similar for both 4-mm to 7-mm and 6-mm prostheses (primary, 46% versus 43%; assisted primary, 62% versus 58%; secondary, 87% versus 91%). The incidence rate of thrombotic occlusion was comparable for both groups (0.74/patient-year versus 0.88/patient-year; P >.05). Mean graft flow at 1, 6, and 12 months was 1416 versus 1415 mL/min, 1345 versus 1319 mL/min, and 1595 versus 1265 mL/min (P >.05) for 4-mm to 7-mm and 6-mm grafts, respectively. Also, no differences in peak systolic velocities in any part of the grafts were observed. The percentage of stenoses detected was equal in both groups at 1 year after surgery (27% versus 20%; P >.05).\nA 4-mm to 7-mm tapered prosthetic brachial-antecubital forearm loop access did not reduce the incidence rates of stenoses and thrombotic occlusions compared with a 6-mm prosthetic conduit. Moreover, no differences in patency rates were observed. Therefore, we believe that the 4-mm to 7-mm graft should not be used routinely for hemodialysis vascular access.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the three likely mechanisms of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) in deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis (increased volume flow, increased flow velocity, and acceleration of flow) and to do this in a variety of positions, in different venous segments, and with the stimulus of three different compression garments.\nIn 12 healthy volunteers, three types of compression cuffs were used: foot, calf, and calf + thigh. The foot was compressed with 80 mm Hg, and the calf and thigh with 40 mm Hg. Duplex ultrasound scan was performed before and during the compression in the horizontal, 15-degree head-down, and 15-degree head-up positions. The common femoral, greater saphenous, profunda femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were examined.\nIn comparison with the horizontal position, the 15-degree head-down position was associated with an increase of volume flow and velocities and the head-up position was associated with decreased flow and velocities in the deep veins. The application of IPC caused significant increases in velocities and volume flow in all venous segments. The lowest increase in velocities and volume flow in the deep veins was observed with the subjects in the head-down position, and in the two other positions, the increases were greater and similar to each other. IPC caused a much more prominent increase in flow velocities and volume flow in deep veins compared with simple elevation of the legs.\nIPC produces significant increases of venous flow volume and flow velocity and acceleration of flow. This is true whether the limbs are elevated, horizontal, or dependent. Segmental flow changes vary with the position of the patient and the compression garment used. Foot compression increases volume flow and velocity primarily in the popliteal vein. Calf compression provides maximal increases of volume flow and flow velocity through the deep veins.",

    "abstract": "Impaired venous drainage in severe chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) leads to microcirculatory overload, characterized by erythrocyte diapedesis and subsequent extravascular hemolysis, resulting in typical dermal hemosiderin deposition. We hypothesized that hemosiderin, normally absent, could be present in the urine in CVI.\nThe three-phase study included 117 patients with CVI and 12 healthy control subjects, all of whom had undergone clinical examination and duplex scanning. In phase 1, current methods were used to test urine for hemosiderin in 61 persons: 12 healthy control subjects, 24 patients with mild CVI (clinical class C1 to C3), and 25 patients with severe CVI (clinical class C4 to C6). In phase 2, the concentration of urinary hemosiderin was determined in 45 consecutive patients with CVI, CEAP class 1 to 6. A score of 0 was assigned when typical hemosiderin granules were absent at microscopic examination, a score of 1 when one to three granules per field were detected; 2 when four to six granules were detected; and 3 when more than six granules were observed. Phase 3 included 23 patients with CVI (clinical class 2 to 6). Hemosiderin concentration was determined and a score assigned before patients underwent surgical procedures to correct primary CVI. Both hemosiderin testing and duplex scanning were repeated after 6 months.\nPhase 1: Urine hemosiderin testing to determine presence or absence of CVI in patients with reflux detectable at duplex scanning yielded the following values: positive predictive value, 96% (95% confidence interval [CI], 86% to 100%); negative predictive value, 88% (CI, 68% to 97%); sensitivity, 94% (CI, 72% to 99%); specificity, 91% (CI, 83% to 99%); and diagnostic accuracy, 95% (CI, 86% to 99%). Phase 2: Hemosiderinuria score enabled classification of clinical severity of CVI. Mean scores, respectively, were clinical class 1, 0.18 +/- 0.12; class 2, 0.75 +/- 0.47; class 3, 1.67 +/- 0.21; class 4, 1.86 +/- 0.26; class 5, 2.50 +/- 0.28; and class 6, 1.92 +/- 0.21 (P <.001). Phase 3: At 6-month follow-up, hemosiderin score was improved, from 2.48 +/- 0.12 preoperatively to 0.78 +/- 0.18 postoperatively (P <.0001). A score of 0 or 1 was associated with successful surgery, whereas a score of 2 or 3 reflected persistence of reflux.\nDetermination of presence of hemosiderin in the urine is a new, sensitive, cost-effective, noninvasive, and repeatable test that enables detection of substantial microcirculatory overload in patients with CVI.",

    "abstract": "Compensatory sweating is the most common and troublesome complication of thoracodorsal sympathectomy. Whether the magnitude of compensatory sweating is related to the extent of sympathectomy is unclear. We investigated the association between the extent of sympathectomy and the occurrence and severity of compensatory sweating after endoscopic transthoracic sympathectomy for upper limb hyperhidrosis.\nFrom September 1992 to June 2000, data from patients undergoing thoracoscopic sympathectomy to treat primary upper limb hyperhidrosis in our department were prospectively collected. Routine follow-up with clinical examination was performed at 1, 3, and 6 months for the first postoperative year and every year thereafter. Late follow-up (February 2001) was with a standardized questionnaire by mail or telephone concerning compensatory sweating and patient satisfaction. Associations between the extent of sympathectomy and the occurrence and severity of compensatory sweating were analyzed with logistic regression and adjusted for age, gender, and relevant confounding factors.\nTwo hundred sixty-eight sympathectomies were consecutively performed in 134 patients (99 female, 35 male; mean age, 27.8 +/- 6.7 years). In the 84 patients with palmar hyperhidrosis, eight underwent T1-T2 resection, four T1-T3 resection, eight T2-T3 resection, and 64 T2-T4 resection. In the 43 patients with palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis, eight underwent T1-T5 resection and 35 T2-T5 resection. The seven patients with isolated axillary hyperhidrosis underwent T3-T5 sympathectomy. No deaths occurred; one conversion for bleeding, one permanent Horner's syndrome, and six minor complications did occur. The initial cure rate was 99.2%. The initial satisfaction rate was 97%. The mean follow-up period was 44.3 months (range, 7 to 100 months), and complete follow-up was available in 132 patients (98.5%). Ninety-five patients (71.9%) had compensatory sweating develop. Seventy patients (53%) judged their compensatory sweating to be minor and intermittent, and 25 patients (19%) judged it severe (16% embarrassing, 3% disabling). On univariate and multivariate analysis, the extent of denervation was not associated with the occurrence or the severity of compensatory sweating. The late satisfaction rate was 91.5%. Compensatory sweating and temporary relief/recurrence were equally considered to be the main causes of dissatisfaction.\nCompensatory sweating was the most common long-term complication of thoracodorsal sympathectomy for primary hyperhidrosis. Its incidence and severity were not associated with the extent of sympathectomy.",

In the Cox model, female gender (hazards ratio [HR], 2.78; 95% CI, 1.23 to 6.28; P =.014), larger Dmax (HR, 1.36 for 10% increase in Dmax; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.66; P =.002), higher diastolic BP (HR, 1.13 for 10% increase in BP; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.92; P =.004), and a decrease in Ep (increase in distensibility) over time (HR, 1.38 for 10% decrease in Ep over 6 months; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.78; P =.010) significantly reduced the time to rupture (had a shorter time to rupture).\nWomen have a shorter time to AAA rupture. The measurement of AAA distensibility, diastolic BP, and diameter may provide a more accurate assessment of rupture risk than diameter alone.",

    "abstract": "Endoluminal repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is predicated on stability of the proximal neck of the aneurysm. Reports on morphologic changes in the proximal neck after endoluminal repair of AAA have thus far been limited in duration to 3 years or less. The aim of this study was to document changes in diameter of the proximal neck of AAA in a group of patients who had undergone endoluminal repair between 5 and 9 years previously.\nBetween May 1992 and December 1996, 61 patients with AAA were treated with endoluminal repair by the senior author. The following patients were excluded from the study group: those requiring primary conversion to open repair at the original operation (n = 8), those with false aneurysm (n = 1), and those with dissection in the proximal neck (n = 1). Fifty-one patients (48 men and three women) with a mean age of 71 years remained in the study group. The endoprostheses used were modified Parodi (n = 4), Endovascular Technologies (n = 14), White-Yu (n = 10), Stentor/Vanguard (n = 21), and Bard 1996 prototype (n = 2). Morphologic changes in the proximal aortic neck were studied with contrast computed tomographic scan with the methodology recommended by the Ad Hoc Committee for Standardized Reporting Practices for Endovascular AAA Repair (revised version). The maximum transverse diameter of the proximal neck was measured 1 cm below the most inferior renal artery. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed showing the proportion of patients at risk with a demonstrated enlargement of the neck at each interval of time compared with the predischarge computed tomographic scan. A longitudinal study of morphologic changes in the proximal aortic neck was also undertaken in 28 patients with successful endoluminal repair who survived 5 years.\nThe Kaplan-Meier curve showed a probability of no dilatation of the proximal neck of 0.943 at 7 years after endoluminal AAA repair. Of 28 patients with 5 years of follow-up after discharge, only two had increases in the diameter of the proximal neck greater than 2 mm. The endograft in both patients had undergone migration before any proximal neck dilation. A paired t test showed that the overall average increase of 0.4 mm (standard error, 0.3 mm) in these 28 patients was not statistically significant (P =.23).\nA high probability (0.943 at 7 years) exists of no enlargement of the proximal neck of AAA after endoluminal repair. We hypothesize that endografts positioned correctly immediately below the renal arteries protect the proximal neck from dilatation in a manner that does not occur after open repair of AAA.",

    "abstract": "Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is the most common cause of leg ulcers. Patients with morbid obesity are remarkable for particularly recalcitrant ulcers. Because obesity is not specifically incorporated in CEAP or other venous scoring systems, we sought to characterize this group of patients more completely.\nPatients with severe CVI (CEAP clinical class, 4, 5, and 6), and class III obesity (body mass index [BMI], >40) were reviewed. Findings from clinical and duplex ultrasound scan (DU) examinations were compared with the CEAP classification, its adjunctive venous clinical severity score, and sensory thresholds.\nA review of clinic records identified 20 ambulatory patients with a mean age of 62 years, a mean BMI of 52, and a mean weight of 164 kg (361 lbs); all but one had bilateral symptoms. No evidence of venous insufficiency was detected with DU in 24 of the 39 limbs. Although some valvular incompetence was detected with DU in 15 of 39 limbs, these abnormalities were widely dispersed between 28 sites; eight limbs had findings at only one site. Ulceration (mean area, 29 cm(2)) was present in 25 limbs and necessitated 7 months for healing; 13 (52%) recurred at least once during a mean observation period of 36 months. The mean sensory threshold of 5.21 exceeded current risk thresholds used in diabetic screening programs. The distribution of CEAP clinical class was C4 (n = 14), C5 (n = 14), and C6 (n = 11). Increasing CEAP class correlated with an increased mean BMI of 47, 52, and 56, respectively (P <.01). CEAP also correlated with a rising mean venous clinical severity score of 10, 11, and 15, respectively (P <.05).\nPatients with class III obesity had severe limb symptoms, typical of CVI, but approximately two thirds of the limbs had no anatomic evidence of venous disease. The association of increasing limb symptoms with increasing obesity suggested that the obesity itself contributes to the morbidity.",

No evidence of venous insufficiency was detected with DU in 24 of the 39 limbs. Although some valvular incompetence was detected with DU in 15 of 39 limbs, these abnormalities were widely dispersed between 28 sites; eight limbs had findings at only one site. Ulceration (mean area, 29 cm(2)) was present in 25 limbs and necessitated 7 months for healing; 13 (52%) recurred at least once during a mean observation period of 36 months. The mean sensory threshold of 5.21 exceeded current risk thresholds used in diabetic screening programs. The distribution of CEAP clinical class was C4 (n = 14), C5 (n = 14), and C6 (n = 11). Increasing CEAP class correlated with an increased mean BMI of 47, 52, and 56, respectively (P <.01). CEAP also correlated with a rising mean venous clinical severity score of 10, 11, and 15, respectively (P <.05).",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical outcome of patients undergoing catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) for lower extremity arterial bypass (LEAB) occlusion.\nA retrospective review was performed of two university-based practices from 1988 to 2001. All patients with LEAB occlusion (<14 days by history) undergoing CDT as initial treatment were included. Technical success, complications, secondary patency, and limb salvage were examined. Additional analysis examined secondary procedures performed for residual lesions or failed CDT and the number of LEABs that were replaced or that became infected.\nOne hundred four patients (77% male; mean age, 65 years) had 109 LEAB occlusions. CDT restored patency in 77%. Of the 25 LEABs that failed initial CDT, 15 underwent surgical thrombectomy/revision, four were replaced, and six underwent no further interventions. Of the 84 LEABs successfully lysed, 51 had residual lesions that underwent revision with interventional (n = 30) or surgical (n = 15) techniques or both (n = 6). Median hospital stay was 8 days with three periprocedural deaths. One quarter of CDT procedures had bleeding or thrombotic complications or both. The mean follow-up period was 45 months. Secondary patency rates on an intention-to-treat basis (attempted thrombolysis) were 32% and 19% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. After successful CDT, the 1-year secondary patency rate was comparable in LEABs with or without residual lesions (42% versus 45%). Overall, the limb salvage rates were 73% and 55% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. The survival rate was 56% at 5 years. Ten of the 54 LEABs (19%) that eventually failed after successful CDT had three or more reocclusive episodes. Seven LEABs (8.3%) salvaged with CDT eventually became infected from recurrent interventions; six of these necessitated major amputation. Twenty LEABs initially salvaged with CDT were replaced (four immediately and 16 after episodes of recurrent ischemia). Two patients died during hospitalization for treatment of recurrent ischemia.\nDespite relatively high initial technical success for LEAB thrombolysis, eventual failure is the rule rather than the exception. Recurrent LEAB occlusions lead to significant morbidity, including recurrent interventions, eventual graft infection/replacement, and limb loss. However, LEAB replacement has substantial problems associated with limited conduit, reoperative anatomy, and subsequent wound complications. We therefore advocate an initial attempt at CDT with liberal use of graft replacement for early and late failures or as an initial strategy in those with favorable remaining conduit.",

    "abstract": "Standard lower extremity contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (LE-CEMRA) with single injection bolus-chase methods on the basis of a single pelvis timing run can be accurate for depicting most vascular occlusive lesions but may fall short of catheter-based angiography when imaging tibial and pedal vessels. Magnetic resonance angiography techniques with a second contrast timing bolus and separate acquisitions for the calves and the pelvis greatly improve reliability and reduce venous contamination to levels that may render conventional angiography obsolete.\nFrom July to December 2001, 60 consecutive patients underwent LE-CEMRA of the calves with separate stepping-table acquisitions of the pelvis and thighs. Forty-five (75%) had complete or partial angiographic correlation during an endoluminal intervention or operative completion study. Lower extremity vessels were divided into anatomic segments (aortoiliac, femoropopliteal, tibial-pedal) for review. Three blinded observers assessed magnetic resonance source partitions, maximum-intensity projections, and volume-rendered images. Disease per segment was graded from insignificant (<20%) to occluded (100%) in 10% increments. Segments were also scored for venous contamination (scale, 0 to 3) and diagnostic quality (scale, 1 to 5). Digital subtraction angiograms were assessed similarly but separately.\nThe combination dual-timing/dual-injection technique had an overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 99%, 97%, and 98%. Venous contamination and artifact were virtually eliminated with combined technique LE-CEMRA. Diagnostic quality of calf and foot vessels was significantly superior to conventional bolus-chase magnetic resonance techniques (P <.01).\nHybrid dual-acquisition LE-CEMRA allows complete timing specification that consistently produces high-quality, artifact-free images of the calf and pedal vessels. These techniques may be accurate enough to replace conventional digital subtraction angiogram for evaluation of lower extremity vascular occlusive disease.",

The intent of this study was twofold: 1, to characterize the flow velocities within AxFBGs; and 2, to determine whether postoperative DS is useful in assessment of future patency of AxFBGs.\nWe identified all patients who underwent AxFBG procedures between January 1996 and January 2001 at our combined university and Veterans Affairs hospital vascular surgical service. All grafts were performed with ringed 8-mm polytetrafluoroethylene with the distal limb of the axillofemoral component anastomosed to the hood of the femoral-femoral graft. DS was every 3 months for 1 year and every 6 months thereafter. Duplex scan results were compared in primarily patent grafts with grafts that thrombosed. Graft failures from infection were excluded. Influences of ankle-brachial index, blood pressure, outflow patency, operative indication, and comorbidities on graft patency were analyzed.\nOne hundred twenty patients underwent AxFBG procedures. Twenty-eight were excluded because of infection or death before surveillance examination. Fourteen were lost to follow-up, 23 had failed grafts from occlusion, and 55 had grafts that remained patent. In the 78 patients evaluated during long-term follow-up period, the mean peak systolic velocities (PSVs) at the proximal (axillary) anastomosis during the first postoperative year ranged from 153 to 194 cm/s. Mean PSVs at the mid portion of the axillofemoral graft during the first postoperative year ranged from 100 to 125 cm/s, whereas those for the distal axillofemoral anastomosis ranged from 93 to 129 cm/s. Mean midgraft and distal anastomotic velocities obtained before thrombosis were significantly lower in the thrombosed grafts compared with the last recorded velocities at the same sites in the patent grafts (mean PSV, 84 versus 112 cm/s; P =.015; mean PSV, 89 versus 127 cm/s; P =.024, respectively). Forty-eight percent of occluded grafts had a mean midgraft PSV at last observation of less than 80 cm/s. Blood pressure correlated with midgraft velocity (r = 0.415; P <.05). With multivariate logistic regression analysis, a mean midgraft velocity less than 80 cm/s was the sole independent factor associated with graft failure (P <.01). No patients with midgraft velocities greater than 155 cm/s had occlusion.\nFlow velocity varies widely within and among AxFBGs. Patency of AxFBGs is associated with higher midgraft PSV, and thrombosis with midgraft velocities less than 80 cm/s.",

    "abstract": "Modifiable patient factors that contribute to graft occlusion may be addressed after surgery. To determine risk factors associated with reverse vein graft (RVG) occlusion, we examined the characteristics and duplex scan surveillance (DS) patterns of patients with RVGs.\nPatients treated with RVG from January 1996 through December 2000 were identified from a prospective registry. The study population consisted of all patients with RVGs performed during the study period with grafts that subsequently occluded. Patients whose grafts remained patent served as age-matched and gender-matched control subjects. The prescribed DS regimen was every 3 months for the first postoperative year and every 6 months thereafter. Early DS failure was defined as having no DS within the first 3 months. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to compare the two groups. Hazard ratios were calculated.\nDuring the study period, 674 patients underwent RVG. Fifty-five patients with occluded RVGs were compared with 118 with patent RVGs. The follow-up period for occluded grafts was 13.40 +/- 12.59 months and for patent grafts was 32.40 +/- 15.61 months. Dialysis therapy, a known hypercoagulable state, continued smoking, and DS failure were independent factors associated with RVG occlusion. The hazards ratio for dialysis was 6.45 (95% CI, 3.07 to 13.51; P <.001), for current smoking was 4.72 (95% CI, 2.5 to 8.85; P <.001), for hypercoagulable state was 2.99 (95% CI, 1.47 to 6.10; P =.003), and for early DS failure was 2.43 (95% CI, 1.29 to 4.59; P =.006).\nContinued smoking and failure to undergo DS within the first three postoperative months are modifiable factors associated with RVG occlusion. Smoking cessation and graft surveillance must be stressed to optimize patency of infrainguinal RVGs.",

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that patients whose conditions do not meet North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial inclusion criteria or have anatomic risk factors constitute a \"high-risk\" group for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and might be candidates for primary carotid angioplasty stenting. Our objective was to review a consecutive series of isolated CEAs, identify the number of such patients at high risk, and determine whether their operations were associated with increased complication rate.\nConsecutive isolated CEAs performed between June 1996 and June 2001 were reviewed. High-risk comorbidities included: age 80 years or more (n = 80), New York Heart Association class III/IV angina (n = 16), Canadian class III/IV heart failure (n = 4), myocardial infarct 6 months or less (n = 11), steroid-dependent or oxygen-dependent pulmonary disease (n = 4), and creatinine level of 3 or more (n = 13). Anatomic high risk was defined by: contralateral occlusion (n = 66), lesion above C(2) or requirement of digastric division (n = 53), reoperation (n = 29), and neck radiation (n = 3). Statistical analysis was with chi(2) analysis.\nOf 788 patients reviewed, 228 (29%) were classified as high risk by one or more of the previous criteria (63% comorbidity, 28% anatomy, 9% both). Presence of preoperative neurologic symptoms and postoperative results were similar across all patient groups. The total stroke and death rate was 1.1% for all the patients. Six patients had postoperative strokes (0.8%), and three patients died of myocardial infarcts (0.4%). The stroke and death rate was 1.3% in the high-risk group as compared with 1.1% in the normal-risk group (P =.51).\nThe concept of the high-risk CEA must be critically reexamined. Although 29% of patients for CEA were high risk as defined by others, we found no evidence that this influenced the results after CEA. Patients with significant medical comorbidities, contralateral carotid occlusion, and high carotid lesions can undergo operation without increased complications. If a high-risk group exists, it is small and restricted to reoperation or radiated neck (4% in this series). With this possible exception, carotid angioplasty stenting should be restricted to randomized clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to document the prevalence and clinical features of aortic aneurysms in heart and abdominal transplant patients.\nWe undertook a retrospective review of 1557 patients who had heart, liver, or kidney transplantation between January 1, 1987, and December 31, 2000. Aortic aneurysms were identified by computed tomographic scan, ultrasound scan, or at the time of surgery for rupture. An aortic diameter of 3.5 cm was used as the threshold for the definition of aneurysmal disease. We compared dichotomous variables with Fisher's exact test and continuous variables with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\nThere were 296 heart, 450 liver, and 811 kidney transplants performed on adult patients during the study period. We identified 18 transplant patients who had an aortic aneurysm (13 heart, three liver, two kidney). Seven patients (41%) had rupture of the aortic aneurysm, and five of these patients died. There were no deaths from causes other than aortic aneurysm rupture. The rate of aneurysm rupture was 22.5% per year. Eight patients had the aortic aneurysm repaired electively with no deaths and no hospital stay greater than 15 days. The mean aortic aneurysm size at rupture was 6.02 +/- 0.86 cm, and the smallest aneurysm that ruptured was 5.1 cm. The pretransplant rate of aortic aneurysm expansion was 0.46 cm/y, but this increased to 1.00 cm/y after transplantation (P =.08). The rate of aortic aneurysm expansion among heart transplant patients and abdominal transplant patients was the same (P =.51). The prevalence of aortic aneurysm was 4.1% in cardiac transplant patients and 0.4% in abdominal transplant patients. Earlier in our series (1987 to 1996), 11% of the cardiac transplant patients were screened for aortic aneurysms, and the prevalence rate of diagnosis was 3.0%. Screening of cardiac transplant candidates became more frequent in 1997 (87% screened), with an associated increase in the aortic aneurysm prevalence rate to 5.8% in the patients who were screened.\nAortic aneurysms in cardiac and abdominal transplant patients have an aggressive natural history with high expansion and rupture rates. Screening transplant patients for aortic aneurysms will increase detection and facilitate elective repair, which is generally well tolerated. These findings support programs for early detection and elective treatment of aortic aneurysms in organ transplant patients, particularly those having heart transplants.",

    "abstract": "The first endovascular stent graft was implanted to treat an abdominal aortic aneurysm more than a decade ago. This technique has evolved dramatically with the growing understanding of metallurgic and fabric sciences and improved device designs. However the potential for stent graft material failure remains. This investigation describes the incidence of material failure, potential modes of device fatigue, and the clinical significance of these failures.\nSix hundred eighty-six endovascular stent grafts were used to treat patients with aortic aneurysms. Device fatigue in the form of stent, suture fracture, or graft wear was identified with an analysis of follow-up radiographs and explanted stent grafts. A review of patient clinical histories, spiral computed tomographic scan studies, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersion spectroscopy of explanted devices was conducted to evaluate the modes and consequences of failure.\nSixty patients were identified with device fatigue, 49 of whom had abdominal endovascular repairs and 11 of whom had thoracic repairs. Of the 60 patients with stent graft fatigue, 43 patients had metallic stent fractures, 14 had suture disruptions, and three had graft holes. These material failures occurred within seven distinct stent graft designs. The average time to the recognition of failure was 19 months, with a mean follow-up period of 8 months since the event was identified. Eleven patients died, and one was lost to follow-up 2 years after identification of a stent fracture. The remaining patients are presently being followed eoyj physical examination, plain film radiograph, and computed tomographic scans for clinical sequelae of device fatigue.\nEndovascular stent graft fatigue has been recognized in numerous devices after aortic implantation. Fatigue may take the form of stent, graft, or suture failure, with certain modes unique to specific stent graft devices. The clinical significance of stent graft material failure remains uncertain.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether intrasac spectral Doppler flow velocities can predict whether or not a type II endoleak will spontaneously seal and to relate intrasac flow to preoperative branch vessel anatomy.\nBetween October 1996 and June 2002, 265 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms underwent endovascular repair. Patients with less than 24 months of follow-up and type I endoleaks were excluded. Type II endoleaks were confirmed with duplex scan and computed tomographic angiography. Two groups were identified: 14 patients with sealed endoleaks (<6 months) without intervention and 16 patients with persistent endoleaks greater than 6 months and without resolution. Spectral Doppler flow velocities were recorded from endoleaks within the aneurysm sac.\nThe two groups were similar in age, demographics, and aneurysm morphology. The mean follow-up times were 29.9 +/- 7.9 months for sealed endoleaks and 30.2 +/- 8.6 months for persistent endoleaks (P = not significant). Spectral Doppler velocities were significantly lower in patients with sealed endoleaks compared with persistent endoleaks (75.5 +/- 78.8 cm/s versus 138.2 +/- 36.2 cm/s; P <.01). Patients with sealed endoleaks and low (<100 cm/s) intrasac Doppler velocities had significantly fewer patent inferior mesenteric arteries (43% versus 81%; P <.01), a smaller inferior mesenteric artery (5.6 +/- 1.8 mm versus 7.2 +/- 1.3 mm; P <.01), and fewer paired lumbar arteries (1.3 +/- 0.8 versus 2.4 +/- 0.6; P <.0001) compared with those with persistent endoleaks and high (>100 cm/s) intrasac flow velocities. Three patients with sealed endoleaks had Doppler velocities of 200 cm/s or greater. However, the diameter of the inferior mesenteric artery in these patients was 4 mm or less with no visualized lumbar arteries before surgery. Aneurysm diameter(-4.6 +/- 5.6 mm) and volume (-0.9 +/- 45.2 mL) decreased in patients with sealed endoleaks. Aneurysm diameter (1.8 +/- 4.9 mm) and volume (18.5 +/- 33.9 mL) increased slightly in patients with persistent endoleaks (P <.05). No ruptures or conversions occurred in any patient. Secondary interventions to treat type II endoleaks were unsuccessful in six of 16 patients (38%) with persistent endoleaks.\nIntrasac Doppler velocities can be used to predict whether a type II endoleak will spontaneously seal. High-velocity type II endoleaks are related to preoperative large branch vessel diameter and number and are resistant to endovascular treatment.",

The mean follow-up times were 29.9 +/- 7.9 months for sealed endoleaks and 30.2 +/- 8.6 months for persistent endoleaks (P = not significant). Spectral Doppler velocities were significantly lower in patients with sealed endoleaks compared with persistent endoleaks (75.5 +/- 78.8 cm/s versus 138.2 +/- 36.2 cm/s; P <.01). Patients with sealed endoleaks and low (<100 cm/s) intrasac Doppler velocities had significantly fewer patent inferior mesenteric arteries (43% versus 81%; P <.01), a smaller inferior mesenteric artery (5.6 +/- 1.8 mm versus 7.2 +/- 1.3 mm; P <.01), and fewer paired lumbar arteries (1.3 +/- 0.8 versus 2.4 +/- 0.6; P <.0001) compared with those with persistent endoleaks and high (>100 cm/s) intrasac flow velocities. Three patients with sealed endoleaks had Doppler velocities of 200 cm/s or greater. However, the diameter of the inferior mesenteric artery in these patients was 4 mm or less with no visualized lumbar arteries before surgery. Aneurysm diameter(-4.6 +/- 5.6 mm) and volume (-0.9 +/- 45.2 mL) decreased in patients with sealed endoleaks. Aneurysm diameter (1.8 +/- 4.9 mm) and volume (18.5 +/- 33.9 mL) increased slightly in patients with persistent endoleaks (P <.05). No ruptures or conversions occurred in any patient. Secondary interventions to treat type II endoleaks were unsuccessful in six of 16 patients (38%) with persistent endoleaks.",

    "abstract": "A bifurcated stent graft device was successfully deployed to exclude an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with adequate proximal aortic neck morphology. At 6 months, a type II endoleak was successfully embolized through a proximal perigraft channel with metallic coils. The patient was seen with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a pulsatile abdominal mass 11 months later. Surgical exploration revealed an aortoduodenal fistula in the vicinity of the previous embolization. We discuss the possible causes of this complication and review the literature on the subject. We conclude that aortoduodenal fistula can occur after endovascular AAA repair despite the absence of endoleak or AAA diameter increase on follow-up computed tomographic scan.",

The endoleak then was sealed with injection of n-butyl cyanoacrylate into the aneurysm sac at the site of the leak with occlusion of aortic flow.

    "abstract": "The mechanism of spinal cord injury has been thought to be related to the vulnerability of spinal motor neuron cells against ischemia. However, the mechanisms of such vulnerability are not fully understood. We previously reported that spinal motor neurons may be lost by programmed cell death and thus now investigate a possible mechanism of neuronal death with immunohistochemical analysis for 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and redox factor-1 (Ref-1).\nWe used a rabbit spinal cord ischemia model with a balloon catheter. The spinal cord was removed at 8 hours, 1, 2, or 7 days after 15 minutes of transient ischemia, and histologic changes were studied with hematoxylin-eosin staining. Western blot analysis for Ref-1, temporal profiles of 8-OHdG and Ref-1 immunoreactivity, and double-label fluorescence immunocytochemical studies were performed.\nMost motor neurons were preserved until 2 days but were selectively lost at 7 days of reperfusion. Western blot analysis of a sample from sham control spinal cord showed a characteristic 37-kDa band that was reduced after ischemia. Immunohistochemistry showed the nuclear expression of Ref-1 in motor neurons of control spinal cords, and immunoreactivity was decreased 1 day after ischemia. On the other hand, no nuclear expression was seen of 8-OHdG in motor neurons of control spinal cords, and immunoreactivity was increased 1 day after ischemia. Double-label fluorescence immunocytochemical study revealed that both 8-OHdG and Ref-1 were positive at 8 hours of reperfusion in the same motor neurons, which eventually die.\nThese results suggest that Ref-1 decreased in motor neurons after transient spinal cord ischemia and that this reduction preceded oxidative DNA damage. The reduction of Ref-1 protein at the moderately late stage of reperfusion may be one of the factors responsible for the delay in neuronal death after spinal cord ischemia.",

    "results": "Most motor neurons were preserved until 2 days but were selectively lost at 7 days of reperfusion. Western blot analysis of a sample from sham control spinal cord showed a characteristic 37-kDa band that was reduced after ischemia. Immunohistochemistry showed the nuclear expression of Ref-1 in motor neurons of control spinal cords, and immunoreactivity was decreased 1 day after ischemia. On the other hand, no nuclear expression was seen of 8-OHdG in motor neurons of control spinal cords, and immunoreactivity was increased 1 day after ischemia. Double-label fluorescence immunocytochemical study revealed that both 8-OHdG and Ref-1 were positive at 8 hours of reperfusion in the same motor neurons, which eventually die.",

    "abstract": "Platelet-endothelial cell adhesion is an important pathologic response to vessel injury or inflammation. On binding to its endothelial or platelet G protein-linked seven-transmembrane domain receptor, protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), thrombin releases a 41-amino acid peptide (TR(1-41)). We examined the effect of TR(1-41) on platelet activation and on platelet-endothelial cell adhesion.\nA monolayer of confluent human saphenous vein endothelial cells was incubated with washed human platelets. Platelets were stimulated with either TR(1-41), TR(21-41), scrambled TR(1-41), adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-epinephrine (EPI), thrombin, or thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP). Platelet activation was identified with flow cytometry. The magnitude of platelet-endothelial cell adhesion was determined with a laser scanning cytometer that scanned the monolayer of endothelial cells and identified fluorescently bound platelets.\nMaximal thrombin stimulation (0.1 U/mL) induced a threefold increase in platelets bound to endothelial cells compared with buffer alone. Stimulation with TR(1-41) (20 mmol/L) tripled the number of platelets bound to endothelial cells compared with thrombin. Scrambled sequence of TR(1-41) (20 mmol/L) and TR(21-41) (20 mmol/L), neither of which induces platelet activation, had minimal effect on platelet adhesion. Both TRAP (20 mmol/L) and ADP-EPI (20 mmol/L) induced less platelet-endothelial cell adhesion than did thrombin. TR(1-41)-induced platelet-endothelial cell adhesion was partially blocked by glycoprotein (GP)IIb-IIIa-specific monoclonal antibody, 10E5 (10 mg/mL).\nTR(1-41), the cleaved peptide of PAR1, is a more potent stimulant of platelet-endothelial cell adhesion than is thrombin, TRAP, or ADP-EPI, and this adhesion is at least in part mediated by the platelet GPIIb-IIIa receptor.",

    "abstract": "Deposition of von Willebrand factor (vWF) is increased in hyperplastic intima of grafts, vWF levels are elevated in patients with cardiovascular diseases, and there is resistance to progression of atherosclerosis in pigs with von Willebrand disease. We hypothesize that increased expression of endothelial vWF has mitogenic effects on smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation.\nIn an in vitro study, mouse aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) were exposed to vWF in various concentrations (0, 5, 20, 100, 500, and 1000 ng/mL). DNA synthesis of SMC was measured with (3)H-thymidine incorporation. In an in vivo study, 108 mice from inbred strains of C57BL/6J (control) and RIIIS/J (characteristic of low plasma vWF) underwent carotid artery ligation (flow cessation model) and were divided into three groups: C57BL/6J, RIIIS/J, and RIIIS/J treated with desmopressin (DDAVP; intraperitoneal injection at 3 micro g/kg/d). At 2 and 4 weeks, carotid arteries were harvested for analysis with immunohistochemical analysis, morphometric studies, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; plasma vWF was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nIn vitro SMC proliferation showed a positive dose-response curve with vWF stimulation. Intimal hyperplasia (IH) in carotid arteries was prominent in C57BL/6J mice, absent in RIIIS/J mice, and moderate in RIIIS/J treated with DDAVP (intima-media ratio, 71% +/- 18%, 0, and 32% +/- 12%, respectively; P <.01). vWF deposition occurred in all hyperplastic intima subjacent to intact endothelium. Plasma vWF correlated with degree of IH (110% +/- 10%, 21% +/- 7%, and 45% +/- 8%, respectively; P <.05). vWF-messenger RNA was 9 times higher in carotid arteries of C57BL/6J mice and 4 times higher in RIIIS/J with DDAVP, compared with RIIIS/J.\nvWF directly stimulates SMC proliferation in vitro via a direct dose-response effect. In vivo low shear stress accelerates IH proportional to vWF expression. This could occur under intact endothelium without platelet activation and platelet-derived growth factor release. In effect, control of IH may entail modulation of vWF expression.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic preconditioning has been found to protect various organs from a subsequent longer ischemic insult. We investigated whether the late phase of ischemic preconditioning reduces spinal cord injury from occlusion of the descending thoracic aorta.\nTwenty-four pigs (27 to 30 kg) were randomly divided in four groups: group I (n = 4) underwent a sham operation, group II (n = 4) underwent aortic occlusion for 20 minutes, group III (n = 8) underwent aortic occlusion for 35 minutes, and group IV (n = 8) underwent aortic occlusion for 20 minutes and, 48 hours later, aortic occlusion for 35 minutes. Aortic occlusion was accomplished with two balloon occlusion catheters placed fluoroscopically at T(6) to T(8) above the diaphragm and at the aortic bifurcation. Neurologic evaluation was performed by an independent observer according to Tarlov's scale (0 to 4, with 4 as normal). The lower thoracic and lumbar spinal cords were harvested at 120 hours and examined histologically with hematoxylin and eosin stain. Histologic results (number of neurons and grade of inflammation) were scored 0 to 4 (4, intact spinal cord; 0, no neurons and high inflammation) and were similarly analyzed. Results were expressed as the mean +/- the standard error of the mean, and statistical analysis used the Kruskal-Wallis test.\nGroup IV had a better neurologic outcome at 24, 48, and 120 hours in comparison with group III (P <.001), although 120 hours after the end of the experiment, the neurologic outcome in group IV was worse than at 24 hours (P =.014). The histologic changes were proportional to the neurologic test scores, with the more severe and extensive gray matter damage in the animals of group III (number of neurons, P <.001; and grade of inflammation, P <.001).\nIschemic preconditioning (late phase, 48 hours after the first occlusion) reduces spinal cord injury after aortic occlusion, as estimated with Tarlov's score and histopathology.",

    "abstract": "Venous hemodynamics evaluated during walking better reflect changes that occur under active physiologic conditions than do conventional static modes of exercise such as tip-toe exercise, knee bending, or dorsiflexion. We prospectively studied the efficacy of air-plethysmography (APG) in monitoring venous hemodynamics during ambulation, and with this method we determined the hemodynamic effects of graduated elastic compression stockings on the lower limb during walking at various speeds.\nThe residual volume fraction (RVF%) during treadmill walking was monitored with APG in 10 limbs with primary chronic venous insufficiency (CVI)(CEAP(2-4)) at four speeds (1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 km/h consecutively), with and without elastic compression (21 mm Hg at the ankle). The method was validated in comparison with standard APG, which is based on tip-toe exercise. RVF obtained during treadmill walking at 1.5 km/h was correlated with RVF measured with standard APG in 30 subjects: 12 healthy volunteers, 11 patients with primary CVI, and 7 postthrombotic limbs. Data were analyzed with nonparametric statistics.\nRVF measurements during walking were reproduced with an intra-day coefficient of variation of 5.1% to 16.5%. RVF during walking correlated well with RVF during standard APG (tip-toe) (r = 0.5, P =.004). At each of the investigated walking speeds, stockings improved venous hemodynamics by decreasing RVF, from a median of 50.5% without stockings to 40.5% with stockings at 1.0 km/h (19.8% decrease), from 49% to 39.5% at 1.5 km/h (19.4% decrease), from 50.5% to 41% at 2.0 km/h (18.8% decrease), and from 53% to 45.5% at 2.5 km/h (14.2% decrease) (all speeds, P <.02). Efficacy of the stockings in decreasing RVF (percent change in RVF) was similar across the spectrum of examined speeds (P =.47). During walking with elastic stockings, nominal RVF values were also similar across the spectrum of walking speeds, except at 2.5 km/h (P =.012). During walking without stockings, RVF did not change with treadmill speed, nor did it differ from that obtained with conventional APG (tip-toe) (P =.46). The percentage decrease in RVF generated with elastic stockings correlated with the venous filling index (r = 0.73, P =.017) at 1.0 km/h.\nAPG is a reproducible and valid method for monitoring venous hemodynamics during walking. Graduated elastic compression stockings significantly improved venous hemodynamics by reducing RVF in limbs with primary CVI at all examined walking speeds (1.0 to 2.5 km/h). The effect was linearly correlated with the amount of reflux (1.0 km/h). The modified application of APG during walking offers a new noninvasive method for assessment of venous hemodynamics in limbs with CVI, enabling quantification of the actual effect of elastic compression therapy during ambulation.",

The study was set in the 166 general practices and 116 specialist clinics in Belgium, France, Italy, and Canada (Quebec) that participated in the VEINES study plus in additional specialist clinics in Ottawa and Montreal. Field testing was carried out in three samples of patients in four countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Canada), including participants in the VEINES study (n dagger 1531) and patients recruited in additional samples of 88 English-speaking patients (Canada) and 53 French-speaking patients (Belgium, France). The reliability and validity sample (n = 615) included 527 VEINES patients and 88 patients from the supplementary English-speaking sample. The test-retest sample (n = 135) included 53 French-speaking and 82 English-speaking patients from the supplementary samples. The responsiveness sample included 1516 VEINES patients. The 26-item VEINES-QOL/Sym is a new, patient-reported questionnaire to evaluate symptoms and quality of life and is available in four language versions (English, French, Italian, French Canadian).\nStandard psychometric tests confirmed the acceptability (missing data, item endorsement frequencies, floor and ceiling effects), reliability (internal consistency, item-total, inter-item correlations) and validity (content, construct, convergent, discriminant, known groups) of the four language versions of the VEINES-QOL/Sym and the test-retest reliability of the English and French versions and provided preliminary evidence of responsiveness in a pooled language sample.\nThe VEINES-QOL/Sym is a practical and scientifically sound, patient-reported measure of outcomes in CVDL that has been developed with rigorous methods. As the only fully validated measure of quality of life and symptoms that is appropriate for use across the full spectrum of CVDL-related conditions, that is quick and easy to administer, and that is available in four languages, the VEINES-QOL/Sym provides a rigorous tool for improving the evaluation of outcomes in clinical trials, epidemiologic studies, and audit.",

    "abstract": "Aortic and carotid stiffness is elevated in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) frequently coexists with AAA and may further impair the arterial wall mechanics and increase the cardiovascular load. We therefore studied the elastic carotid and muscular femoral biomechanical properties and intima-media thickness (IMT) in this group of patients.\nThe elastic indices and IMTs of the common carotid and common femoral arteries were determined in 30 patients with AAA (15 with PVD) with a duplex scanner coupled with a wall tracking system. Fasting plasma creatinine level, glucose and lipid concentrations, and their physiologic variables known to influence the arterial wall mechanics were also assessed.\nPatients with AAA and PVD have significantly stiffer carotid (Petersen's elastic modulus, 2207 +/- 905 mm Hg versus 1268 +/- 432 mm Hg; P =.001; stiffness index, 22.73 +/- 9.63 versus 12.60 +/- 4.24; P =.001] and femoral (Petersen's elastic modulus, 4906 +/- 4057 mm Hg versus 2599 +/- 1169 mm Hg; P =.043; stiffness index, 49.02 +/- 40.04 versus 26.07 +/- 13.22; P =.044) arteries than subjects with AAA alone. Although patients with PVD have thicker carotid and femoral IMTs, no statistical difference was seen between the two groups. The subjects were matched for age, body mass index, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, total vascular risk score, plasma creatinine level, and fasting lipid and glucose concentrations.\nSubjects with PVD and AAA have significantly stiffer carotid and femoral arteries, which may indicate increased cardiovascular load and may account for the highest mortality rate seen in these patients in the UK Small Aneurysm Trial. Therefore, treatment of associated cardiovascular risk factors is important and may have to be tailored on an individual basis according to the findings of the arterial wall mechanics.",

    "abstract": "Few will debate that infrainguinal arterial reconstruction increases limb salvage. However, numerous reports describe a difference in results in coronary and peripheral arterial reconstructions between men and women. In this study, we analyze the outcome of infrainguinal bypasses performed over 30 years and stratify the results by gender.\nWe reviewed our vascular registry from 1968 to 1999 for all infrainguinal arterial reconstructions. Demographics, indications, and adverse outcomes were analyzed. Patency, limb salvage, and survival rates were determined with life-table analysis. The chi2, log-rank, and Student t tests were used to determine statistical significance.\nFive thousand eight hundred eighty procedures were performed, with 2161 in women (37%). Women were significantly older (71 versus 66 years), more often diabetic (53% versus 50%), and less often smokers (27% versus 44%) and more often had surgery for limb salvage (89.8% versus 81.0%). Mortality, complications, and need for revision did not differ. Primary patency rate was 44% versus 47%, secondary patency rate was 55% versus 58%, and survival rate was 39% versus 34% in men and women, respectively, at 10 years (all P >.05). Limb salvage rate in women exceeded that in men (93% versus 88%) at 10 years. Subgroup analysis by conduit also revealed no difference in patency.\nInfrainguinal arterial reconstruction can be performed safely with comparable results in women and men. Although women may present older and more often for limb salvage, outcomes do not appear to be adversely affected.",

    "abstract": "The traditional measure of success after exclusion and bypass of popliteal artery aneurysm (PAA) is graft patency. In addition to fate of the bypass, we hypothesize that late outcome after surgical treatment of PAA is influenced by completeness of exclusion.\nThirty patients who underwent 41 reconstructions for PAA over a 10-year period were reviewed.\nExcluded PAAs were examined with duplex ultrasound scan for size, patency, and patent feeding branches; bypass grafts and native inflow and outflow arteries were examined for patency and size. Thirty-six limbs were available for follow-up (mean follow-up period, 46 +/- 42 months). Only two aneurysms (5.6%) appeared patent on duplex ultrasound scan, but five limbs had patent arterial branches communicating with thrombosed excluded PAAs. PAA diameter decreased from 2.5 +/- 0.8 cm to 1.7 +/- 0.5 cm (P <.0001) in most. However, 12 excluded PAAs (33%) showed significant enlargement from 2.2 +/- 0.9 cm to 2.8 +/- 1.0 cm (P =.002). A quarter of enlarging excluded PAA were associated with new compressive symptoms. Three methods of PAA exclusion were used: proximal and distal ligation with short segment isolation (type 1), proximal and distal ligation with long segment isolation (type 2), and single ligature (type 3). In univariate analysis, type of exclusion significantly influenced late size of excluded PAA (P =.004). Type 1 exclusion was superior to both type 2 and 3 exclusions in producing aneurysm diameter reduction. Type 3 exclusion resulted in aneurysm growth. In addition, excluded aneurysms with visualized feeding branches were associated with significant growth compared with PAAs without feeding branches (P =.006). Graft primary and assisted primary patency rates at 5 years were 86% +/- 9.4% and 92% +/- 7.4%, respectively. Although graft diameter and native donor artery diameter significantly increased, this did not adversely affect graft patency.\nEnlargement of excluded PAA after surgical treatment can cause compressive symptoms. Exclusion requires adequate vascular isolation to prevent late PAA enlargement, with proximal and distal arterial ligation best performed adjacent to the aneurysm. Vein graft enlargement occurs, but this enlargement does not adversely influence patency.",

    "abstract": "Subintimal angioplasty (SIA) has been advocated to treat long segment lower extremity arterial occlusions, but many question its value. We evaluated the role of SIA in a group of patients with severe lower extremity arterial occlusive disease.\nDuring a 2.5-year period, 39 patients with arterial occlusions (median length, 8 cm; range, 2 to 31 cm) were treated on an intention-to-treat basis with SIA. Twenty-five patients had gangrene, five had rest pain, and nine had disabling (<one block) claudication. There were 24 superficial femoral, two superficial-femoral-popliteal, four popliteal, two popliteal-tibial, five tibial, and two external iliac artery lesions. With fluoroscopic guidance, via a prograde common femoral artery puncture (n = 29) or a contralateral common femoral artery puncture (n = 9), a subintimal dissection plane was created across the occlusion with a standard guidewire and catheter. The arterial lumen was reentered distal to the occlusion, and the recanalized segment balloon was dilated. All patients were followed prospectively with arterial duplex scan.\nSIA was technically successful in 34 of 39 patients (87%). All five failures were from an inability to reenter the patent lumen distally. These five patients underwent successful bypasses that in no case were more distal than would have been required before SIA. In the 34 technically successful SIAs, pain completely resolved (14/14) and areas of gangrene (21/25) healed. The cumulative patency rate in patients who underwent successful SIA was 74% +/- 10% at 12 months. The mean increase in ankle-brachial index after SIA was 0.34 (range, 0.1 to 0.69). There were two distal embolic events, successfully treated surgically (n = 1) or with catheter-directed techniques (n = 1). Three patients underwent subsequent bypass, and the remaining five patients remain asymptomatic.\nSIA is feasible and can be effective in some patients with lower extremity arterial occlusions and threatened limbs. These results, plus SIA's many advantages, support an increasing role for it in the treatment of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease.",

    "abstract": "Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is currently the most commonly used technique for postoperative surveillance to detect endoleaks after endovascular stent graft repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. We have evaluated the efficacy of duplex ultrasound scan with the addition of an ultrasound scan contrast agent in documenting endoleaks and compared these results with CTA.\nConventional duplex ultrasound scan with color Doppler imaging (CDI) was first done as part of routine postoperative surveillance. After the CDI study, a 1-mL bolus of ultrasound scan contrast was given via an antecubital vein, followed by a 5-mL flush with normal saline solution. The duplex ultrasound scan evaluation of the stent graft was repeated once the contrast agent was circulating throughout the blood pool, with tissue harmonic imaging to optimize visualization of the contrast agent. Status of the stent graft, the presence or absence of any endoleak, and whether these endoleaks were graft related (group I) or arterial branch related (group II) were recorded. Findings were compared with CTA studies done within a 2-week period of the ultrasound scan examination.\nTwenty patients were evaluated, 18 with modular stent grafts and two with unibody bifurcated stent grafts. Patients had a mean age of 74.5 +/- 7.6 years; 19 were male, with only one female. All stent grafts remained widely patent with normal aortoiliac flow hemodynamics. Duplex ultrasound scan with contrast identified all eight of the endoleaks seen with CTA and was able to determine whether they were group I or group II leaks. In two patients, ultrasound scan with contrast detected small endoleaks at the proximal graft attachment site, with extravasation of contrast into the aneurysm sac during systole. These endoleaks were not seen with CTA but were confirmed with conventional angiography at the time of endovascular closure. Standard duplex ultrasound scan with CDI failed to identify four of the 10 endoleaks in patients with technically difficult conditions.\nDuplex ultrasound scan, when used with an intravenously administered ultrasound scan contrast agent in the noninvasive follow-up of patients with aortic stent grafts, appears to provide good sensitivity to the presence and type of endoleaks, even in patients with technically difficult conditions not amenable to conventional duplex ultrasound scan with CDI.",

Patients had a mean age of 74.5 +/- 7.6 years; 19 were male, with only one female. All stent grafts remained widely patent with normal aortoiliac flow hemodynamics. Duplex ultrasound scan with contrast identified all eight of the endoleaks seen with CTA and was able to determine whether they were group I or group II leaks. In two patients, ultrasound scan with contrast detected small endoleaks at the proximal graft attachment site, with extravasation of contrast into the aneurysm sac during systole. These endoleaks were not seen with CTA but were confirmed with conventional angiography at the time of endovascular closure. Standard duplex ultrasound scan with CDI failed to identify four of the 10 endoleaks in patients with technically difficult conditions.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the intraoperative use of a new angle-independent ultrasound scan device (EchoFlow [EF]) in measurement of carotid artery velocities after endarterectomy. Specifically, the purpose was to determine the reproducibility of velocity measurements obtained with EF and to compare these measurements with the velocity measurements obtained with duplex ultrasound scan.\nVelocity measurements of the common, internal, and external carotid arteries were performed by the operative surgeon with EF in 65 consecutive patients after carotid endarterectomy (36 female, 29 male; mean age, 71 years). Three velocity measurements were obtained from each of the arteries with EF and compared with the velocity measurements obtained with duplex ultrasound scan performed by a radiologist.\nVelocity measurements obtained with the EF device were reproducible in the common, internal, and external carotid arteries (intrapatient correlation coefficients, 0.95, 0.96, and 0.95, respectively). Seventy-five percent of common, 88% of internal, and 78% of external carotid velocity measurements obtained with the angle-independent ultrasound scan device were within 25 cm/s of the velocities measured with duplex ultrasound scan. The mean differences in velocity measurements between EF and duplex scan were -12 cm/s in the common, -8 cm/s in the internal, and -11 cm/s in the external carotid arteries. Differences between the EF device and duplex scan velocity measurements correlated with increasing arterial velocities in each of the three arteries measured (P <.05).\nReproducible measurements of carotid artery velocity may be obtained with a new angle-independent Doppler system after endarterectomy. Most measurements obtained with the EF system are clinically comparable with those obtained with standard duplex ultrasound scan. This novel low-cost device may be useful in the intraoperative assessment of hemodynamic adequacy of carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair (EVR) of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is being performed with increasing frequency worldwide. No studies have a complete follow-up of more than 4 years. Our study objective was to assess the long-term results and the durability of a first-generation stent graft with complete 7-year follow-up.\nBetween March 1994 and May 1995, 23 consecutive patients underwent treatment with the Chuter stent graft at a single center. All patients underwent computed tomographic scan before discharge, at 3 and 6 months, and annually thereafter. The data were prospectively collected on all patients. The median follow-up period was 72.5 months (range, 0.2 to 91 months). None of the patients were lost to follow-up.\nAmong these 21 men and two women with a median age of 69 years (range, 52 to 85 years), 11 (47.8%) were at high risk. The 30-day technical success rate was 87%. Acute (30-day) complications were one graft deployment failure (4.3%) that necessitated an immediate conversion, 20 intraoperative graft limb kinks (87%), all of which needed additional Wallstent (Schneider, Minneapolis, Minn) placement, four renal failures (17.4%), one type Ia endoleak complicated with AAA rupture (4.3%), and three perioperative deaths (13%). Late complications were eight type I or II endoleaks (34.8%) after a mean delay of 23.9 months (range, 3 to 69 months), 13 proximal stent migrations (56.5%) after a mean delay of 29.6 months (range, 7 to 58 months), six graft limb thromboses (26.1%) after a mean delay of 38.7 months (range, 3 to 71 months), one AAA rupture (4.3%), and 11 deaths (47.8%), with five AAA-related deaths (21.7%). The 3-year, 5-year, and 7-year cumulative endoleak rates were 34%, 41%, and 49%, respectively; the cumulative migration rates were 66%, 75%, and 75%, respectively; and the cumulative open surgery rates were 30%, 50%, and 50%, respectively. At the same intervals, the cumulative survival rates for any death were 69%, 56%, and 49%, respectively; the cumulative survival rates for AAA-related deaths were 82%, 82%, and 73%, respectively; and the cumulative secondary success rates were 54%, 28%, and 28%, respectively.\nThis studies emphasizes the need for close lifelong surveillance of AAAs treated with EVR. Despite the small population of this series, a long-term follow-up highlights that the first-generation homemade stent graft evaluated in this study failed to adequately protect the patient from AAA-related death and that most of the serious complications were related to a late failure of the aortic neck attachment. Better proximal fixation of the aortic stent graft is essential to improve the durability of EVR.",

    "abstract": "Gangrenous bowel, intraabdominal sepsis, and previous failed mesenteric bypass are indications for use of an autogenous conduit for mesenteric arterial reconstruction. Saphenous vein (SV) is often used as the autogenous conduit of choice, but it may be prone to graft stenosis or occlusion. Recent experience with superficial femoral vein (SFV) suggests that it is an excellent alternative conduit for major arterial reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of SV and SFV for mesenteric arterial bypass.\nDuring a 7-year period, 26 patients underwent 43 mesenteric arterial bypass procedures with autogenous conduit. SV was used for 23 bypasses (53%), and SFV was used for 20 bypasses (47%). Indications for revascularization included chronic mesenteric ischemia (n = 15; 58%), acute mesenteric ischemia (n = 9; 35%), and mycotic aneurysm of the paravisceral aorta (n = 2; 7%). Three patients (11%) underwent revascularization with SV grafts and two patients (8%) with SFV grafts after previous failed mesenteric bypass.\nThe 30-day mortality rate was 15%. Three deaths occurred after SV bypass for acute mesenteric ischemia, and one death occurred after a SFV bypass for a ruptured paravisceral mycotic aneurysm. Twenty-two surviving patients were followed for a mean of 31 +/- 6 months. Three of 11 patients (27%) who survived after SV bypass had recurrent mesenteric ischemia develop (acute, n = 1; chronic, n = 2) from graft thrombosis at a mean interval of 32 +/- 22 months after surgery. No patient had recurrent symptoms develop after SFV bypass. One of the three patients with SV graft failure died of acute mesenteric ischemia, and the other two patients underwent successful bypass with SFV. Symptomatic graft failure was significantly more likely to occur in patients receiving SV grafts compared with SFV grafts (P <.05).\nSFV yields acceptable clinical outcomes for mesenteric arterial bypass compared with SV. SFV is a viable alternative to SV when autogenous conduit is indicated for mesenteric arterial reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early and late outcomes of renal autotransplantation (RAT) according to the etiology of the underlying renal artery disease.\nBetween January 1985 and April 2001, we performed 68 RAT procedures in 57 patients. The surgical indications were fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) for 34 RAT procedures in 30 patients (11 men, 19 women; mean age, 41.3 +/- 14.6 years), Takayasu's disease (TD) for 26 RAT procedures in 19 patients (five men, 14 women; mean age, 33.0 +/- 12.3 years), and atherosclerosis for eight RAT procedures in eight patients (seven men, one woman; mean age, 66.5 +/- 7.9 years). The incidence rate of hypertension was 87% in patients with FMD and 100% in patients with TD and atherosclerosis. The incidence rate of renal dysfunction was 75% in patients with atherosclerosis, 27% in patients with FMD, and 16% in patients with TD. Autotransplantation was isolated in 31 cases and was associated with another vascular procedure in 37 cases, including 22 thoracoabdominal aorta repairs and 11 abdominal aorta or iliac artery repairs. The technique used to achieve renal revascularization was direct reimplantation in 17 cases and indirect reimplantation in 51 cases. The conduit used for indirect reimplantation was an arterial autograft in 42 cases, a vein autograft in seven cases, and a prosthetic graft in two cases. Simultaneous revascularization of the contralateral kidney was performed in 21 patients and included nine RAT procedures. Contralateral nephrectomy was performed in five patients.\nIn the FMD group, early segmental infarction was observed in four cases. Secondary nephrectomy was necessary in one case (at 88 months). Actuarial survival rates were 96.2% +/- 0.03% at 5 years and 84.1% +/- 0.11% at 10 years. Secondary patency rates were 100% at 5 years and 92% +/- 0.07% at 10 years. Hypertension normalized or improved in 96% of patients. Renal function improved in 50% of patients. In the TD group, one patient died of multiple organ failure 4 days after the procedure. Nephrectomy was necessary in one case. The actuarial survival rate was 94.7% +/- 0.05% and the secondary patency rate was 91.3% +/- 0.05% at both 5 and 10 years. Hypertension normalized or improved in 89% of the cases, and kidney function improved in all cases. In the atherosclerosis group, nephrectomy was necessary during the early postoperative period in three cases and during late follow-up in two cases (at 9 months and at 68 months, respectively). Actuarial survival rates were 54.7% +/- 0.2% at 5 years and 18.2% +/- 0.16% at 10 years. The secondary patency rates were 50.0% +/- 0.17% at 5 years and 33.3% +/- 0.18% at 10 years. Hypertension normalized or improved in 50% of cases, and kidney function improved in 33% of cases.\nRAT is highly effective for treatment of complex renovascular lesions related to FMD and TD. Although RAT is less effective for atherosclerosis, it may be the only alternative in cases involving extensive renovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine the effect of gadolinium arteriography on renal function and its diagnostic accuracy in patients with azotemia with suspected renovascular disease.\nCatheter-based digital subtraction arteriographic studies with gadolinium as the contrast agent were performed on 25 occasions in 21 consecutive patients with azotemia to evaluate renal arterial circulation. Gadolinium (gadodiamide, 287 mg/mL) was the only contrast used in these studies. Quantities of gadolinium administered ranged from 40 to 264 mL (mean +/- standard deviation, 124 +/- 74 mL). Serial determinations of renal function were performed in all patients. Arteriography was undertaken 20 times after prior renal revascularizations: seven times as a routine postoperative follow-up study, nine for increasing azotemia, three for worsening hypertension, and once for evaluation of a known renal artery stenosis in patient with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Three additional arteriograms were performed as part of an evaluation for suspected renovascular hypertension. The two remaining arteriograms were performed in patients with known aortic aneurysms in whom renal artery stenosis was suspected.\nNo adverse changes in renal function followed gadolinium arteriography. Prearteriography serum creatinine values ranged from 1.6 to 9.1 mg/dL (3.0 +/- 1.4 mg/dL), compared with postangiography values that ranged from 1.2 to 8.4 mg/dL (2.9 +/- 1.3 mg/dL). Comparable blood urea nitrogen values ranged from 23 to 71 mg/dL (40.1 +/- 13.5 mg/dL) before arteriography and from 21 to 68 mg/dL (36.5 +/- 13.3 mg/dL) after arteriography. All 38 renal arteries evaluated were adequately imaged. First-order and second-order branchings were well visualized on selective renal studies. Twenty-one renal arteries showed no abnormalities, including six of seven reconstructed arteries subjected to early postoperative evaluation. Twelve renal arteries manifested significant disease, including seven with stenoses and five that had become occluded. Among five additional renal arteries studied, two exhibited obstructing thrombus, two had dissections, and one had a kinked aortorenal bypass graft.\nCatheter-based arteriography in patients with azotemia with gadolinium as a contrast agent is a safe and effective means to evaluate the renal arterial circulation. The preferential use of gadolinium in lieu of nephrotoxic iodinated contrast agents for catheter-based arteriography in patients with azotemia is supported by this experience.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated a large number of families in which at least two individuals were diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysms to identify the relationship of the affected relatives to the proband.\nFamilies for the study were recruited through various vascular surgery centers in the United States, Finland, Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom and through our patient recruitment website (www.genetics.wayne.edu/ags).\nWe identified 233 families with at least two individuals diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysms. The families originated from nine different nationalities, but all were white. There were 653 aneurysm patients in these families, with an average of 2.8 cases per family. Most of the families were small, with only two affected individuals. There were, however, six families with six, three with seven, and one with eight affected individuals. Most of the probands (82%) and the affected relatives (77%) were male, and the most common relationship to the proband was brother. Most of the families (72%) appeared to show autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, whereas in 58 families (25%), abdominal aortic aneurysms were inherited in autosomal dominant manner, and in eight families, the familial aggregation could be explained by autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. In the 66 families where abdominal aortic aneurysms were inherited in a dominant manner, 141 transmissions of the disease from one generation to another were identified, and the male-to-male, male-to-female, female-to-male, and female-to-female transmissions occurred in 46%, 11%, 32%, and 11%, respectively.\nOur study supports previous studies about familial aggregation of abdominal aortic aneurysms and suggests that first-degree family members, male relatives, in particular, are at increased risk. No single inheritance mode could explain the occurrence of abdominal aortic aneurysms in the 233 families studied here, suggesting that abdominal aortic aneursyms are a multifactorial disorder with multiple genetic and environmental risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has been advocated as a minimally invasive and inexpensive alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). However, a precise comparative analysis of the immediate and long-term costs associated with these two procedures has not been performed. To accomplish this, a Markov decision analysis model was created to evaluate the relative cost effectiveness of these two interventions.\nProcedural morbidity/mortality rate for CEA and costs (not charges) were derived from a retrospective review of consecutive patients treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital/Cornell (n = 447). Data for CAS were obtained from the literature. We incorporated into this model both the immediate procedural costs and the long-term cost of morbidities, such as stroke (major stroke in the first year = $52,019; in subsequent years = $27,336/y; minor stroke = $9419). We determined long-term survival rate in quality-adjusted life years and lifetime costs for a hypothetic cohort of 70-year-old patients undergoing either CEA or CAS. Our measure of outcome was the cost-effectiveness ratio.\nThe immediate procedural costs of CEA and CAS were $7871 and $10,133 respectively. We assumed major plus minor stroke rates for CEA and CAS of 0.9% and 5%, respectively. We assumed a 30-day mortality rate of 0% for CEA and 1.2% for CAS. In our base case analysis, CEA was cost saving (lifetime savings = $7017/patient; increase in quality-adjusted life years saved = 0.16). Sensitivity analysis revealed major stroke and death rates as the major contributors to this differential in cost effectiveness. Procedural costs were less important, and minor stroke rates were least important. CAS became cost effective only if its major stroke and mortality rates were made equivalent to those of CEA.\nCEA is cost saving compared with CAS. This is related to the higher rate of stroke with CAS and the high cost of stents and protection devices. To be economically competitive, the mortality and major stroke rates of CAS must be at least equivalent if not less than those of CEA.",

Wound complications were classified as cellulitis (I), an open/draining wound (II), or threatened/exposed graft (III). Actual hospital costs were analyzed in a subset of 84 patients without excessive preoperative stay or additional major inflow or flap procedures, and the financial data were converted to 2001 US dollars.\nFrom March 1999 to December 2001, 242 bypasses were performed with open (n = 134) or endoscopic (n = 108) vein harvest techniques. Overall (34.1% versus 20.4%; P <.02) and class II (15.9% versus 6.5%; P <.03) wound complication rates and length of stay were significantly greater in the OPEN group. Financial subset analysis revealed a significant reduction in total cost ($6203 +/- $3326 versus $7456 +/- $3186; P <.01) in the ENDO versus the OPEN group. Readmissions for wound complications were more common in the OPEN versus the ENDO group (11.4% versus 4.1%; P <.03), resulting in an additional total cost of $204,557 versus $23,797, respectively. Patency and limb salvage at a mean of 7.1 months (range, 1 to 32 months) did not differ.\nEndoscopic saphenous vein harvest results in a cost savings of more than $1200 per procedure during hospitalization and of almost $2200 per procedure including the costs of readmission. This is primarily from a shortened length of stay, a decreased rate of major wound infections, and a reduction in the need for early readmission.",

Suboptimal performance of endovascular procedures in an operative setting, or inappropriate reliance on endovascular techniques, might theoretically compromise graft patency. We questioned whether late graft thrombosis is frequently attributable to failure at the endovascularly treated site in this setting.\nBetween May 1, 1993, and June 30, 2001, we performed 125 concomitant endovascular and open arterial reconstructions (73 primary reconstructions, 52 graft revisions) in 106 patients. Endovascular techniques were used to treat inflow lesions in 72 cases, outflow lesions in 14 cases, both in four cases, and the graft itself in 35 cases. Fifty-five iliac, 18 femoral, 13 popliteal, six tibial, and 35 graft lesions were treated. For primary bypasses, 33 were to the popliteal level (21 prosthetic, 12 autogenous), 19 were to the tibial or pedal arteries (16 autogenous, three prosthetic or composite), and 12 were to the femoral arteries (one autogenous, 11 prosthetic). Nine patch angioplasties (eight femoral, one popliteal) were performed. For graft revisions, endovascular intervention was for inflow in 13 cases, outflow in three cases, both in one case, and of the graft itself in 35 cases. Surgical revisions involved segmental grafts in 33 cases, patch angioplasty in 18 cases, and both in one case.\nIn the primary group, the initial technical success rate of the endovascular procedure was 93% (68/73), with five patients needing open conversion. The 30-day mortality rate was 1.4%, and the morbidity rate was 11.0%. Of the 19 grafts in the primary group that occluded during the follow-up period (mean, 11.9 months), five thromboses could possibly be attributed to failure at the endovascular site. In the revision group, the initial technical success rate of the endovascular procedure was 88% (46/52), with six patients undergoing conversion to open procedure. The 30-day mortality rate was 0%, and the morbidity rate was 15.4%. Of 22 late graft occlusions in the revision group, only three were attributed to failure at the endovascular site.\nThis largest report to date of concomitant lower extremity endovascular and open revascularization procedures shows the approach to be safe. Few late graft occlusions were attributable to failure at the endovascularly treated site. The concomitant approach offers the efficiency and convenience of single stage therapy and allows immediate treatment for inadequate endovascular results or their complications and potential cost savings.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to review our experience over the last decade with the dorsalis pedis bypass for ischemic limb salvage in patients with diabetes mellitus.\nThe study was a retrospective analysis of a computerized vascular registry and chart review. From January 10, 1990 to January 11, 2000, 1032 bypasses to the dorsalis pedis artery were performed in 865 patients (27.6% of the 3731 lower extremity arterial bypass procedures performed in that time period). Five hundred ninety-seven patients (69%) were male, with a mean age of 66.8 years. Ninety-two percent had diabetes mellitus. All procedures were done for limb salvage. Conduits included 317 nonreversed saphenous vein (30.7%), 273 in situ (26.4%), 235 reversed vein (22.8%), 170 arm vein (16.5%), 35 other vein (3.4%), and two polytetrafluoroethylene (0.2%) grafts. The inflow arteries were as follows: 294 common femoral (28.5%), 550 popliteal (53.2%), 114 superficial femoral (11%), and 74 other (7.2%).\nThe mortality rate within 1 month of surgery was 0.9%, and 42 grafts (4.2%) failed in the same interval, although 13 were successfully revised. In a follow-up period that ranged from 1 to 120 months (mean, 23.6 months), primary patency, secondary patency, limb salvage, and patient survival rates were 56.8%, 62.7%, 78.2%, and 48.6%, respectively at 5 years and 37.7%, 41.7%, 57.7%, and 23.8% at 10 years. Both polytetrafluoroethylene grafts failed in less than 1 year. Primary graft patency was worse in female patients (46.5% female versus 61.6% male at 5 years; P <.009) but better in patients with diabetes (65.9% diabetes mellitus versus 56.3% non-diabetes mellitus at 4 years; P <.04). Saphenous vein grafts performed better than all other conduits with a secondary patency rate of 67.6% versus 46.3% at 5 years (P <.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that length of stay greater than 10 days and dorsalis pedis bypass for the surgical indication of previous graft occlusion were independently predictive of worse graft patency at 1 year and use of saphenous vein as conduit was predictive of better patency.\nDorsalis pedis bypass is durable with a high likelihood of ischemic foot salvage over many years. Saphenous vein is the preferred conduit when available. Short vein grafts from distal inflow sites are possible in more than 50% of cases. These results justify the routine use of pedal arterial reconstruction for patients with diabetes with ischemic foot complications.",

    "abstract": "Ninety-four patients (37 male, 57 female; mean age, 51.0 years) underwent reconstruction for renal artery aneurysm (RAA) between 1980 and 2001. RAAs were present in 52 patients in the right kidney, in 29 patients in the left kidney, and in 13 patients in both kidneys. Eighty-three aneurysms were located in the mainstem, 49 in a branch artery, and four in an accessory artery. Additional ipsilateral renal artery stenoses (RAS) occurred in 26 patients, bilateral RAS in 18, and contralateral RAS in six. The causes of RAA were fibromuscular dysplasia (n = 48), atherosclerosis (n = 28), dissection (n = 7), aortic coarctation (n = 5), arteritis (n = 3), giant cell arteritis (n = 1), Marfan's syndrome (n = 1), and trauma (n = 1). Seventy-five patients had hypertension, 14 were asymptomatic, and five had rupture. Indications for RAA repair concerned aneurysms with 1 cm or more diameter in combination with risk factors of hypertension, ipsilateral and contralateral stenosis, and childbearing age in women. Without risk factors, aneurysm size eligible for reconstruction was limited to 2 cm or more.\nMethods applied for reconstruction in 107 kidneys and 136 aneurysms included aneurysm resection with tailoring (n = 37), saphenous vein graft interposition (n = 40), tailoring and saphenous vein graft interposition (n = 7), resection and reanastomosis (n = 14), saphenous vein graft interposition and resection and reanastomosis (n = 3), polytetrafluoroethylene bypass (n = 5), and homologous vein graft interposition (n = 1). Four reconstructions had to be performed ex situ because of multiple branch involvement in three patients and rupture in one. In all patients, the concerned kidney was protected with hypothermic flush perfusion with addition of heparin and prostaglandin E1.\nThe overall morbidity rate was 17%, including one early graft occlusion, one partial thrombosis of the renal artery that necessitated fibrinolytic therapy, and a branch artery stenosis after tailoring managed with aortorenal bypass. The mortality in elective cases was null; one patient died of myocardial infarction 2 days after an emergency operation for ruptured RAA. The technical primary success rate was 96.8%; the secondary success rate was 98.9%. After a follow-up period from 1 to 143 months (mean, 46 months) in 83 patients (88%), 67 (81%) had patent renal arteries free of stenoses. Among six patients with RAS, four underwent successful reoperation, five had mainstem occlusions, three had segmental artery occlusions, and two underwent nephrectomy. Concerning the patients who underwent reoperation, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was considered seriously but assessed as inappropriate because of long extension of stenosis or involvement of branch arteries. Hypertension was cured in 19 patients (25%) and improved in 17 (22%).\nSurgical reconstruction of RAA is a safe procedure that provides good long-term results, prevents aneurysm rupture, cures or improves hypertension in about half of the cases, and can be achieved with autogenous reconstruction in 96%.",

We investigated the short-term and long-term results of open repair of infrarenal AAA in a high-risk and comparison low-risk patient population.\nConventional open surgical repair of nonruptured infrarenal AAA was performed in 572 consecutive patients from 1990 to 2000. Patients were considered at high risk if they had one or more of the following criteria: age 80 years or more, creatinine level 3.0 mg/dL or higher, severe pulmonary insufficiency, severe cardiac dysfunction, or hepatic failure. A retrospective review was carried out to determine relative risks, perioperative morbidity and mortality, and long-term survival. A P value of less than.05 was considered statistically significant.\nOne hundred twenty-eight of the study patients (22%) were at high risk and 444 were at low risk. Patients at high risk were older (77 versus 69 years; P <.001), were more likely female (26% versus 16%; P <.009), and had larger (mean, 5.9 versus 5.6 cm; P <.024), more symptomatic (20% versus 13%; P <.001) aneurysms. The 30-day operative mortality rate for the high-risk group was 4.7%, compared with 0.0% (P <.001) in the low-risk group. Overall and major morbidity rates were 29% and 14% in the high-risk cohort versus 17% (P <.003) and 5% in the low-risk cohort, respectively. The 5-year survival rate was 46% (standard deviation, 5.2%) in the high-risk group versus 74% (standard deviation, 2.6%) in the low-risk group (P <.001). On multivariate analysis, age 80 years or more (P <.046), creatinine level 3.0 mg/dL or higher (P <.022), prior stroke (P <.012), and pulmonary dysfunction were significant predictors of poor operative outcome (30-day mortality and major morbidity), and female gender (P <.035), cardiac dysfunction (P <.004), creatinine level 3.0 mg/dL or higher (P <.0001), prior stroke (P <.005), and pulmonary dysfunction (P <.0001) negatively impacted long-term survival rates.\nThis study shows that open repair of infrarenal AAA in patients at high risk can be performed with relative safety and with results that offer a benchmark with which endovascular repair can be compared. Poor long-term survival in this population, however, highlights the importance of patient selection and raises the question of whether repair of many patients at high risk is warranted.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to establish the risk of rupture as related to size of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), gender, and expansion of the aneurysm.\nBetween 1976 and 2001, 476 patients with conditions considered unfit for surgery with AAA 5.0 cm or more were followed with computed tomographic scans every 6 months until rupture, surgery, death, or deletion from follow-up. Surgery was performed for rupture (n = 22), improved medical condition (n = 37), increase in size (n = 95), symptoms (n = 17), and other reasons (n = 24).\nFifty ruptures occurred during the follow-up period. The average risk of rupture (and standard error) in male patients with 5.0-cm to 5.9-cm AAA was 1.0% (0.01%) per year, in female patients with 5.0-cm to 5.9-cm AAA was 3.9% (0.15%) per year, in male patients with 6.0-cm or greater AAA was 14.1% (0.18%) per year, and in female patients with 6.0-cm or greater AAA was 22.3% (0.95%) per year.\nThe risk of rupture in male patients with AAA 5.0 to 5.9 cm is low. The four-time higher risk of rupture in female patients with AAA 5.0 to 5.9 cm suggests a lower threshold for surgery be considered in fit women. The data regarding risk of rupture in patients with AAA 6.0 cm or more may allow more appropriate decision analysis for surgery in patients with unfit conditions with large AAA.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the current inpatient hospital cost and Medicare reimbursement of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) at different hospitals.\nThe cost of EVAR from October 2000 to October 2001 with two commercially available endografts (Ancure, Guidant Endovascular Solutions, Menlo Park, Calif; and AneuRx, Medtronic AVE, Santa Rosa, Calif) was retrospectively analyzed at seven hospitals. Three university (n = 111) and four community hospitals (n = 110) from different regions of the country participated in the survey. Consecutive cases with complete financial records were included. Hospital finance departments provided their best estimates of hospital costs, including overhead for operating room, endograft, medical supply, bed, radiology, laboratory, and pharmacy services and reimbursement on the basis of hospital-specific Diagnostic Related Groups (DRG) 110 or 111. Detailed hospital charges and International Clinical Diagnosis codes also were reviewed from Universal Billing-92 forms submitted to Medicare. An additional cost analysis was performed by the authors to validate the estimates of the hospital financial departments. Outliers of more than three standard deviations from the mean were excluded.\nThe mean total hospital cost was $22,999, and mean reimbursement, weighted by case mix, was $20,837, resulting in a net loss of $2162. The majority of EVAR cost was from the device (57%) and other medical supplies (16%). EVAR was reimbursed on the basis of DRG 110 in 78% of cases and of DRG 111 in 22%. Reimbursement varied widely by hospital and location (mean, $20,837; range, $14,818 to $35,343; standard deviation, $5450). With the exclusion of one hospital where reimbursement was not based on the DRG, cases reimbursed with DRG 110 resulted in an average loss of $2200, while the average loss was $9198 with DRG 111. The mean net loss for hospitals reimbursed with the DRG system was $3898.\nEVAR reimbursement is presently inadequate to cover hospital expenses. Substantial financial losses occurred at four of the participating centers. University hospitals fared surprisingly better because of higher reimbursement.",

The device is a modular bifurcated system with nitinol/expanded polytetrafluoroethylene components and a smaller profile than currently approved devices.\nIn a multicenter, concurrent controlled phase II trial, 334 patients underwent treatment with the Excluder bifurcated endoprosthesis (test, n = 235; W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif) or with standard open repair (control, n = 99). Preoperative characteristics, perioperative variables, follow-up clinical evaluations, and radiographic examination results through the first 2 years were analyzed with univariable and multivariable statistics.\nPatients in the test group had less blood loss (310 +/- 19 mL versus 1590 +/- 124 mL; P <.0001), fewer homologous transfusions (6% versus 32%; P <.0001), and shorter lengths of stay (2.0 +/- 0.1 days versus 9.8 +/- 1.4 days; P <.0001). Early major adverse events were markedly reduced in the test group (14% versus 57%; P <.0001), and this difference persisted at 2 years. No difference was seen in survival rate (P =.13). In the first 2 years, no deployment failure, early conversion, or aneurysm rupture occurred. At the 2-year timepoint, core laboratory read trunk migration in 1%, limb migration in 1%, limb narrowing in 1%, endoleak in 20%, and aneurysm growth in 14%. One wire discontinuity (0.6%) was identified in a discharge film. A 7% annual reintervention rate was seen in the test group in the first 2 years.\nThe test device is a safe and effective treatment compared with open surgical repair for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. The most striking benefits are reduced blood loss, fewer complications, and faster recovery. Two-year survival rate was similar.",

    "abstract": "Unlike abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, little information exists regarding aortic-related morbidity (synchronous/metachronous aneurysm or graft-related complications) after thoracoabdominal aneurysm (TAA) repair. This study was performed to define such events and identify factors related to their development.\nOver a 15-year interval, 333 patients underwent TAA repair (type I, n = 90; 27%; type II, n = 59; 18%; type III, n = 118; 35%; and type IV, n = 66; 20%). Late aortic events were defined as aortic disease causing death or necessitating further intervention or graft-related complications (infection, pseudoaneurysm, branch occlusion) after hospital discharge. Variables were assessed for their association with aortic events with Cox proportional hazards regression.\nIn-hospital mortality occurred in 28 patients (8.4%), which left 305 available for follow-up (mean length of follow-up, 26 months; interquartile range, 2.7 to 38.4 months). After TAA repair, aneurysm remained in 60 patients (19.7%; ascending/arch, n = 41; 68.3%; discontinuous infrarenal, n = 12; 20%; contiguous descending, n = 7; 11.7%; contiguous abdominal, n = 4; 6.7%). Events occurred in 33 individuals (10.8%) at 30 +/- 27 months after surgery. Twenty-four patients (73% of events; 7.9% of cohort) had aortic-related events, including another elective aneurysm repair (n = 16), urgent/emergent aneurysm operation (n = 5), acute dissection (n = 2), and atherothrombotic embolization (n = 1). Nine patients (27% of events; 2.9% of cohort) had graft-related incidents, including renovisceral occlusion (n = 5), visceral patch pseudoaneurysm (n = 2), graft infection (n = 2), and graft-esophageal fistula (n = 1). Variables independently predictive of events were female gender (odds ratio [OR], 2.3; P =.03), initial aneurysm rupture (OR, 4.8; P =.04), partial disease resection (OR, 4.2; P =.0008), and expansion of remaining aortic segments on imaging surveillance (OR, 2.5; P =.03). The event-free survival rates were 96% (95% CI, 93% to 98%) and 71% (95% CI, 60% to 83%) at 1 and 5 years.\nLate aortic events occur in at least 10% of patients after TAA repair and are usually the result of native aortic disease in remote (or noncontiguous) aortic segments. Graft-related complications, in particular, degeneration of inclusion anastamoses, are rare. Female gender, original presentation with rupture, and unresected disease identify those at highest risk. These findings verify the anatomic durability of TAA repair and suggest indefinite aortic surveillance is indicated for those at risk of events.",

After TAA repair, aneurysm remained in 60 patients (19.7%; ascending/arch, n = 41; 68.3%; discontinuous infrarenal, n = 12; 20%; contiguous descending, n = 7; 11.7%; contiguous abdominal, n = 4; 6.7%). Events occurred in 33 individuals (10.8%) at 30 +/- 27 months after surgery. Twenty-four patients (73% of events; 7.9% of cohort) had aortic-related events, including another elective aneurysm repair (n = 16), urgent/emergent aneurysm operation (n = 5), acute dissection (n = 2), and atherothrombotic embolization (n = 1). Nine patients (27% of events; 2.9% of cohort) had graft-related incidents, including renovisceral occlusion (n = 5), visceral patch pseudoaneurysm (n = 2), graft infection (n = 2), and graft-esophageal fistula (n = 1). Variables independently predictive of events were female gender (odds ratio [OR], 2.3; P =.03), initial aneurysm rupture (OR, 4.8; P =.04), partial disease resection (OR, 4.2; P =.0008), and expansion of remaining aortic segments on imaging surveillance (OR, 2.5; P =.03). The event-free survival rates were 96% (95% CI, 93% to 98%) and 71% (95% CI, 60% to 83%) at 1 and 5 years.",

We report delayed paraparesis after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in which one hypogastric artery was unintentionally occluded due to atheroembolism. A spinal catheter was immediately inserted after onset of paraplegia to promote cerebrospinal fluid drainage, which partially reversed the neurologic deficit. Our case underscores both the importance of the critical spinal collateral supply from the hypogastric artery and the role of spinal fluid drainage to maximize spinal cord perfusion in the setting of spinal cord ischemia.",

AEF can either be primary, arising from the aneurysm or other diseases, causing the aorta to erode into the bowel, or secondary, from previous aortic grafting. Primary aortoduodenal fistula (ADF) is a rare clinical entity that usually presents with gastrointestinal bleeding that can be occult, intermittent, or massive. We report a 71-year-old woman with acute onset of abdominal pain and massive hematemesis. Esophagogastroduodenal endoscopy (EGD) and arteriography were nondiagnostic. The patient's condition became unstable, and she was brought emergently to the operating room where the diagnosis of an ADF was made. The ADF and AAA were surgically repaired, and the patient recovered without complications. This case represents an example of a rare complication of AAA with the unusual presentation of multiple aortic aneurysms. We will address the pathophysiology, diagnostic evaluation, and management of AEF.",

Only one other report of a lateral plantar artery pseudoaneurysm was found in the literature; no reports involving the medial plantar artery have been reported. A cadaver dissection supports the hypothesis that the lateral plantar artery is more superficially located and therefore more vulnerable to injury compared with the medial plantar artery. Clinicians treating patients with lacerations of the foot should be aware that an arterial injury may be present, even in the absence of active bleeding.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular targets of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to determine whether cyclic strain induces smooth muscle cell (SMC) alignment via the ROS system. We assessed stretch-induced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H) oxidase activation and the redox sensitivity of cyclic strain-stimulated activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family.\nSMCs were seeded on flexible collagen I-coated plates and exposed to cyclic strain. NAD(P)H oxidase activation was measured with lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescent detection of superoxide. Activation of MAPK was detected by determining phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1/2), and p38 MAPK with immunoblotting. In other experiments, SMCs were exposed to diphenylene iodonium (DPI), an NAD(P)H inhibitor, 30 minutes before stretch. MAPK activation and cell orientation were then assessed.\nCyclic strain elicits a rapid increase in intracellular NADH/NADPH oxidase in SMCs. There was also a rapid and robust phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 MAPK. Cyclic strain-induced intracellular NAD(P)H generation was almost completely blocked with DPI. DPI also inhibited the strain-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 MAPK. Both the p38 MAPK specific inhibitor, SB 202190, and DPI blocked cyclic strain-induced cell alignment, but PD98059, an ERK1/2-specific inhibitor, and SP600125, an anthrazolone inhibitor of JNK, did not.\nOur results provide evidence that p38 MAPK is a critical component of the oxidant stress ROS-sensitive signaling pathway and plays a crucial role in vascular alignment induced by cyclic stain.",

Functional TF activity was assessed with chromogenic TF assay. TF antigen was determined with immunohistochemistry. Northern blot analysis was used to determine steady- state TF messenger RNA (mRNA). Electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay was performed to determine the nuclear binding activity of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappaB). NFkappaB activity was inhibited by either prior transduction of RASMCs with mutant IkappaB or treatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate.\nRASMCs exposed to SNAP or infected with AdiNOS exhibited increased functional TF activity and antigen. Regardless of the source of NO, a time-dependent and concentration-dependent increase in TF activity was observed. Steady-state TF mRNA levels were also increased by NO delivered via either method. NFkappaB nuclear binding activity was also increased by NO. Inhibition of NFkappaB activity by either pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate treatment or mutant IkappaB transduction abrogated NO-induced enhancement of TF mRNA and functional activity.\nIn RASMC, NO exposure results in upregulation of TF functional activity, antigen, and mRNA.

    "abstract": "Arterial intimal hyperplasia is induced by injury and is frequently the cause of luminal narrowing after vascular reconstruction. Smooth muscle cells (SMC) respond to injury by proliferating and migrating into the intima. This process is regulated by thrombin, endothelin, and angiotensin II, all ligands of G protein-coupled receptors. Signal transduction from these receptors in cultured cells depends in part on transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We hypothesize that EGFR has a substantial role in activation of SMC in vivo and development of intimal hyperplasia.\nIntimal hyperplasia was induced in rat carotid arteries by passage of a balloon catheter. Animals were given a monoclonal blocking antibody to rat EGFR, matched mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) control antibody, or saline solution.\nBlocking EGFR antibody inhibited medial SMC proliferation, as determined by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling at 2 days (IgG control, 8.0% +/- 2.0%; anti-EGFR, 3.2% +/- 0.8%) and intimal hyperplasia at 14 days (intimal area: IgG control, 0.07 +/- 0.01 mm(2); anti-EGFR, 0.04 +/- 0.01 mm(2)).\nActivation of EGFR is important for early induction of SMC proliferation and subsequent intimal thickening.",

OGF (10 mg/kg), the opioid antagonist naltrexone (NTX; 30 mg/kg), or saline solution (0.2 mL) was injected intraperitoneally daily for 28 days into the rats, and restenosis of the carotid artery was examined with morphometric analysis using Optimas software. Proliferation of the neointima and media was measured by radioactive thymidine incorporation over 3 hours. The presence of OGF and its receptor, OGFr, were examined with immunofluorescence microscopy.\nOGF depressed DNA synthesis in the intima and media from 16% to 78% of control levels in the first 2 weeks after deendothelialization, whereas NTX exposure elevated DNA synthesis by 21% to 89%. OGF action was receptor-mediated. In the month after injury the thickness of the intima in OGF-treated rats was decreased by 18% to 31% from control values, whereas intimal thickness was increased in the NTX group by 10% to 31%. Luminal area was almost 25% greater than control values in the OGF group, but was reduced 17% by NTX. OGF and the OGF receptor were detected in the carotid artery with immunohistochemistry.\nThese results demonstrate for the first time that a native opioid system modulates repair of vascular injury.

Both atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are inflammatory diseases tightly linked to the function of these cells. The correlation and contribution of MIF to these human diseases remain unknown, although a recent rabbit study showed expression of this cytokine in atherosclerotic lesions.\nMIF immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue sections from five normal aortas, seven atherosclerotic carotids, and six AAAs. A group of 112 men with small AAAs (defined as 3 to 5 cm) was recruited at the time of diagnosis, had serum samples taken, and was followed annually for 1 to 5 years (mean, 2.9 years) and referred for surgery if the AAA exceeded 5 cm in diameter. Of this study group, 98 had serum MIF measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 61 had detectable levels.\nIn human atherosclerotic and aneurysmal lesions, MIF protein colocalized in macrophages, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, but normal arteries had negligible MIF expression. Furthermore, serum-MIF levels correlated significantly with annual expansion rate (r = 0.28; P =.005), persisting after adjustment for initial AAA size, smoking habits, diastolic blood pressure, ankle blood pressure index, and age. After exclusion of 38 cases with MIF levels below the detection limit, initial AAA size was also significantly correlated with the MIF levels (r = 0.42; P =.001), persisting after adjustment for similar confounders, and the correlation coefficient with expansion rate increased to 0.42 (P =.001).\nHighly expressed MIF in macrophages, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in lesions from atherosclerosis and AAA and significant association between serum MIF level and AAA initial size and AAA expansion rate in a group of patients with AAA suggest a potential involvement of this proinflammatory cytokine in the pathogenesis of these cardiovascular diseases.",

Postdeployment CTA was performed in 15 of these 20 patients (75%). All preoperative CTA and MRA and postdeployment CTA data sets were analyzed with an automated software tool. The length of the stent grafts on postdeployment CTA was measured and compared with the true length of the primary component. Two readers independently evaluated 13 vessel parameters on preoperative CTA and MRA, which are considered to be important in planning stent graft deployment.\nWith the automated analysis software tool, all measurements could be performed on either CTA or MRA data sets. There was no statistically significant difference between postdeployment measurements of stent graft length on CTA and the true dimensions of the implanted stent grafts. Interobserver agreement for all of the measurements with either CTA or MRA was good to excellent (interclass coefficient, 0.71 to 0.99) with only minimal mean differences of measured dimensions between both readers (range, -2.0 to +2.3 mm, Bland-Altman). Intermodality agreement between CTA and MRA was good to excellent (interclass coefficient, 0.62 to 0.98) with small mean differences of measured dimensions between both methods (range, -4.1 to +2.1 mm, Bland-Altman).\nVolumetric measurement with an automated analysis software tool allows a fast, precise, and reliable noninvasive preoperative determination of all aortic dimensions on the basis of either CTA or MRA data sets.",

From January 1995 to December 2000, 16 consecutive patients were seen with concomitant abdominal aortic aneurysm and bladder carcinoma at our institutional referral center. All patients underwent a standard operative protocol that included aneurysm graft replacement, radical cystoprostatectomy, and urinary reconstruction. Endovascular treatment of the aneurysm was considered in the last 2 years of the study. After each simultaneous treatment case, two control patients were selected according to the same type of vascular or urinary procedure, respectively, and pathologic staging. The analyzed endpoint was mortality, and confounder variables included common and disease-specific risk factors. Frequencies of vascular, urologic, and systemic complications were carefully considered with special attention to graft infection and tumor recurrence.\nEndovascular treatment was not performed for morphologic reasons. No perioperative mortality was observed. A trend toward inferior survival rates in simultaneously treated patients was observed in the early follow-up period, but survival analysis with log-rank test showed no statistical difference among the groups (P =.19). Cox proportional hazard model results proved no influence of the different group treatments on survival (P =.49) and no influence of age and risk factors, except for preoperative renal status (P =.015). The increased mortality rate of the simultaneous treatment group could be ascribed to the presence of preoperative moderate renal insufficiency in two study group patients. Long-term survival of treated patients is mainly dependent on cancer progression. Graft infection and other vascular complications were not observed. Systemic and urologic complications were similar in study and control groups.\nThis study shows that the simultaneous surgical approach to coexisting abdominal aortic aneurysm and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder represents a suitable choice of treatment in highly specialized centers, but patients with preoperative renal insufficiency should be carefully evaluated. Endovascular treatment represents an appealing alternative whenever indicated.",

The aim of this study was to determine the relationships between the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), organ failure, and mortality after AAA repair and to determine whether the clinical monitoring of SIRS was a useful adjunct to clinical method.\nOne hundred consecutive patients undergoing open AAA repair were prospectively studied. Patients were divided into three groups: those undergoing elective AAA repair, those with symptomatic but nonruptured AAA, and those with ruptured AAA.

Multiorgan failure occurred in 3.8% of the elective group, 38% of the urgent group, and 64% of the ruptured AAA group. After ruptured AAA repair, the concurrent absence of both SIRS and any organ failure for 48 hours had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 91% as a predictive indicator of subsequent survival to hospital discharge.

    "abstract": "This study sought to identify risk factors associated with an unfavorable outcome after elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nThe clinical records of 158 patients who underwent elective open AAA repair with COPD determined from preadmission International Classification of Diseases-ninth revision codes during a 12-year period at the University of Michigan were reviewed. Patients with uncomplicated outcomes (group I) were compared with those with unfavorable postoperative outcomes (group II). The unfavorable outcomes were defined as myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, worsening respiratory insufficiency necessitating tracheostomy, or death within 30 days of surgery. Logistic regression analyses of variables that were identified as being statistically significant in the univariate analysis were used to develop a predictive model of these events.\nGroup I included 133 patients (77 men, 56 women) with a mean age of 70.1 years, and group II included 25 patients (13 men, 12 women) with a mean age of 71.4 years. Preoperative factors statistically related (P =.002) to an unfavorable outcome in group II patients included: suboptimal COPD management (fewer prescribed inhalers), lower hematocrit, preoperative renal insufficiency, and coronary artery disease. Importantly, abnormal preoperative spirometry and arterial blood gases were not predictive of a poor outcome. Univariate analysis also revealed increased hospital (25 versus 13 days; P =.0001) and intensive care unit (14 versus 4 days; P =.001) length of stays and a greater need for prolonged ventilation (8 versus 1 day; P =.039) for group II patients compared with group I patients. The 30-day mortality rate in the entire experience was 3.2% (5/158). No specific variables associated with mortality were identified.\nFewer prescribed inhalers, lower hematocrit, renal insufficiency, and coronary artery disease are preoperative factors associated with unfavorable outcomes after open elective surgical repair of AAA in patients with COPD. Intensive management of these factors may reduce the hazards of AAA operations in these patients. COPD alone should not be considered a deterrent to the surgical treatment of AAAs.",

    "abstract": "Management of asymptomatic popliteal aneurysm is controversial, and the prognosis for acutely thrombosed aneurysm is notoriously poor. We evaluated the management and outcome for popliteal aneurysm.\nA retrospective review of all patients with popliteal aneurysm between 1988 and 2000 was carried out. Fifty-two limbs were operated on in 41 patients. Data collected included findings at presentation, operative details, graft patency, limb salvage, complications, and 30-day mortality.\nInitial findings included acute ischemia (n = 14), no symptoms (n = 29), acute rupture (n = 2), chronic ischemia (n = 5), and symptoms of nerve or vein compressive (n = 2). All patients with symptomatic aneurysms and 22 patients with asymptomatic aneurysms (21 larger than 2 cm in diameter, 1 with thrombus at duplex ultrasound scanning) underwent surgery as first-line treatment. Of the 7 patients with asymptomatic aneurysm managed with surveillance with duplex ultrasound scanning, acute ischemia developed in three, 1 aneurysm ruptured, compressive symptoms developed in 1, and 2 remained asymptomatic but required surgery because of aneurysm enlargement (>2 cm). Of the 17 patients with acute ischemia, 13 had neurologic signs and underwent immediate thromboembolectomy (trifurcation alone in 8, ankle-level arteriotomy in 4) and bypass grafting (n = 12) or inlay grafting (n = 1), and the other 4 underwent intra-arterial thrombolysis initially. Of these 4 procedures, 2 were successful and had elective surgery; the other 2 required urgent surgery because of secondary distal embolism and failure of recanalization. Thirteen of the 17 grafts were to the crural vessels. Bypass grafting (medial approach) was used in 16 of the 17 patients with acute ischemia, all 5 patients with chronic ischemia, and the 8 patients with no symptoms. An inlay technique (posterior approach) was used in 16 patients with no symptoms, the 3 patients with symptoms of nerve or vein compression, and 1 patient with acute ischemia. The distal anastomoses were to the below-knee popliteal artery in 35 patients and the crural arteries in 15 patients, using autologous vein. Two of the patients with rupture underwent ligation alone, the other undergoing bypass grafting in addition. The overall 5-year primary patency rate was 69%, secondary patency rate was 87%, and limb salvage rate was 87%. Limb salvage was achieved in 14 of the 17 patients with acute ischemia. Patients with asymptomatic aneurysms had better secondary graft patency (100%) compared with symptomatic aneurysms (74%; P <.01). Acute ischemia, technique used, and crural artery grafts were not predictors of graft failure with either univariate or multivariate analysis. Symptomatic aneurysms were associated with more postoperative complications and greater 30-day mortality (4 of 28 vs 0 of 24).\nThromboembolectomy followed by crural bypass grafting is an effective treatment for popliteal aneurysm with severe acute limb ischemia. Outcome is better with surgical management of asymptomatic popliteal aneurysm compared with symptomatic aneurysm.",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction of a diseased common carotid artery may necessitate direct repair via aortic artery-based revascularization. However, carotid-carotid artery crossover grafting is an alternative extra-anatomic option that obviates the need for median sternotomy. We analyzed our results with carotid-carotid artery crossover bypass surgery.\nData were analyzed for all patients undergoing carotid-carotid crossover bypass surgery from 1995 to 2000. Data on patient demographics, indications for surgery, perioperative morbidity and mortality, and graft patency were retrieved from a vascular surgery data base and hospital records. Stroke-free survival and graft patency were determined with life table methods.\nOver 5 years, 24 carotid-carotid artery crossover bypass procedures were performed to treat both symptomatic (n = 19, 79%) and asymptomatic (n = 5, 17%) disease. Nine procedures (38%) were performed in men, 3 (13%) in patients with diabetes, 12 (50%) in active smokers, and 2 in patients with a history of Takayasu arteritis. Patient mean age was 63 years (range, 38-79 years). Twenty-three patients (96%) received polytetrafluoroethylene conduit grafts, and the remaining patients received vein grafts. Ten (42%) patients underwent concomitant endarterectomy. There were no perioperative deaths. One patient (4%) had asymptomatic early occlusion, one had transient neurologic deficit (4%), one (4%) required additional surgery because of bleeding, and one (4%) had a perioperative cerebrovascular accident (stroke). Three (17%) asymptomatic late occlusions were identified at 11, 57, and 64 months, respectively. Mean follow-up was 30 months (range, 1-70 months). Primary patency was 88%, and secondary patency was 92% at 3 years. Stroke-free survival was 94% at 4 years.\nCarotid-carotid artery crossover bypass surgery is a safe and durable procedure. Its use precludes the need for median sternotomy and provides acceptable stroke-free survival.",

The purpose of this study was to test the effect of female gender and estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy on perioperative (30-day) and long-term (5-year) outcomes after CEA.\nFrom 1988 to 1998, 361 CEAs were performed in 326 patients (246 male, 115 female) by a single surgeon. Retrospective data were collected with chart review, and follow-up data were obtained with clinical examination or telephone interview. Follow-up was possible in 95% of patients. Reoperative CEAs and combined aortic or cardiac procedures were excluded. Statistical analysis used life-table methods, Student t test, and Pearson chi(2) tests when appropriate.\nAge and preoperative risk factors were similar between women and men. CEA was performed for symptomatic (50% female, 42% male) and asymptomatic carotid stenosis (50% female, 58% male; P =.19). Perioperative (30-day) stroke rate was similar for women and men (3.6% female, 1.2% male; P =.13). No perioperative strokes occurred in asymptomatic patients. With previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, a trend was seen towards an increased perioperative stroke rate in women (7.0% female, 2.8% male; P =.25). Long-term follow-up showed a similar trend in the 5-year stroke rate in symptomatic patients (7.0% female, 2.8 male; P =.23). The stroke-free survival rate was not significantly different between genders (87% female, 75% male; P =.58). Reoperation was performed for asymptomatic recurrent carotid stenosis in five men (2.3%) and two women (1.9%; P =.84). Interestingly, the use of estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy in women showed a trend toward increasing stroke rate at 30 days (1.2% versus 8.7%; P =.08) and at 5 years (2.3% versus 8.7%; P =.16).\nThis retrospective study confirms that CEA provides long-term reduction in stroke risk and improved stroke-free survival rates in both men and women. However, women with previous neurologic symptoms and those using hormone replacement therapy appear to be at higher stroke risk at the time of surgery.",

    "abstract": "Dilatation of the artery proximal to arteriovenous fistula (AF) is not well known but is a potential serious complication in patients for renal transplant.\nFrom 1991 until 2001, the diameters of the brachial arteries of 29 patients after successful renal transplantation and with existing AF were prospectively evaluated with ultrasound scan. Nine patients with longstanding AF without transplantation were included as a control group.\nIn 1991, the mean brachial artery diameter was 6.4 mm (+/-1.8 mm) with patent AF and 5.2 mm (+/-1.5 mm) with occluded AF (P= not significant). The 1994 mean diameter was 6.6 mm (+/-1.7 mm) versus 5.3 mm (+/-2.0 mm; P =.029). In 2001, the mean diameter rose to 7.4 mm (+/-1.3 mm) versus 5.7 mm (+/-2.8 mm; P =.022). Compared with the side without fistula, the diameter of brachial artery on the AF side was significantly greater during the whole study period. The increase in the diameter correlates significantly with the time the AF had been patent (P =.001, according to Spearman test). The dilatation of the brachial arteries of patients without transplantation was smaller compared with patients after transplantation but did not reach statistical significance. Two patients had to undergo operation on a symptomatic aneurysm of the axillobrachial artery.\nAccording to our results, dilatation of the brachial artery after AV is time dependent. Higher flow in the AF seems to be the main trigger of dilatation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immediate and short-term outcome of inserted cryopreserved vein valve allografts and the clinical outcome of treated limbs.\nTwenty-seven cryovalves were inserted in 25 postthrombotic limbs because of active leg ulcer (20 limbs) or severe disabling leg pain (five limbs) as a procedure of last resort. Previous venous surgery had been performed in 80% of the limbs. Main stem superficial reflux and iliac venous outflow obstruction were controlled before cryovalve insertion. The most common insertion site was the superficial femoral or popliteal vein. Patients were followed up with clinical examination and with intermittent duplex Doppler scanning or ascending venography to assess patency and competency of the valve station.\nAfter thawing, but before insertion, 74% of the cryovalves were incompetent and needed repair with transcommissural valvuloplasty. After insertion, mortality was zero. Morbidity was 48%, mainly because of seroma formation and deep wound infection. One cryovalve was explanted because of acute rejection. Six cryovalves occluded early (<6 weeks), and five occluded late. Cumulative rates of patent cryovalves and both patent and competent cryovalves at 24-month follow-up were 41% and 27%, respectively. Cumulative ulcer recurrence-free rate at 36 months was 50%. Pain relief was poor, and degree of swelling remained the same.\nCompared with autologous vein transfer, cryovalve insertion is associated with high morbidity, high occlusion rate, poor cumulative midterm rate of patent graft with competent valve, and poor clinical results. The procedure should not be used as a primary technique for valve reconstruction, and it is questionable whether it is useful even in patients in whom autologous reconstruction techniques have been exhausted.

    "abstract": "While definitive therapy awaits level I evidence, controversy persists regarding the optimal operation for treatment of advanced chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). We propose a pragmatic approach to the correction or amelioration of venous hypertension resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic venous reflux. We evaluated a strategy of balloon dissection, subfascial endoscopic perforating vein surgery (SEPS) with routine posterior deep compartment fasciotomy, including ligation and stripping of the superficial system, for use when reflux is documented at duplex ultrasound (US) scanning.\nThis is a cooperative, multicenter, retrospective review of 832 patients stratified by CEAP classification. The series consisted of 300 patients with C4 CVI, 119 patients with C5 CVI, and 413 patients with C6 CVI. A subset of 92 patients with C4 disease were prospectively randomized, and ambulatory venous pressure (AVP) was determined preoperatively and postoperatively. All patients underwent duplex US scanning to document reflux in the deep, superficial, and perforating venous systems. Efficacy, safety, and durability were evaluated over follow-up of 1 to 9 years (mean, 31/2 years). Uniformity was attempted by adoption of the senior author's protocol and technique through on-site preceptorship in each surgeon's operative theater.\nThis technique interrupted 3 to 14 (mean, 7) incompetent perforating veins per patient. Of the 832 patients undergoing SEPS, 460 (55%) underwent saphenous vein ligation and stripping at the same operation. In 92% ulcers healed or were significantly improved within 4 to 14 weeks. In 64 (8%) patients, ulcers failed to heal or there was no benefit from the operation. Thirty-two patients (4%) experienced recurrent ulceration or skin deterioration at 6 months-2 years (mean, 15 mo). Repeat SEPS was successful in 25 of these 96 patients, and deep valve repair was successful in 4 patients. In the 92 randomized patients with C4 disease, 41 refused postoperative AVP, leaving 51 compliant patients. The SEPS group (n = 25) had significantly reduced AVP (P <.01) compared with the control group (n = 26). Complications in 825 patients were less than 3% and consisted mostly of transient neurologic disorders (eg, paradysthesia), but deep venous thrombosis occurred in 2 patients, with pulmonary embolus in 1. No operative deaths occurred. Follow-up for 1 to 9 years (mean, 31/2 years) demonstrated durability.\nThe efficacy, safety, and durability of this operative protocol proved beneficial in our clinical experience with 832 patients during 9 years of follow-up. The SEPS subset of randomized patients with C4 disease experienced significant decrease in AVP, objectively supporting the effectiveness of reflux surgery in advanced CVI. Until definitive level I evidence is available, this operative technique is advocated as optimal therapy for CVI.",

    "abstract": "This paper is an update of previously published data on the basis of a retrospective review of midterm results of ethanol sclerotherapy on 87 patients (January 1995 to December 2000) for assessment of its efficacy as an improved treatment method for venous malformation (VM). According to this assessment, VMs were defined with a new classification and studied with advanced diagnostic technology and an advanced care system.\nThe average follow-up period was 24 months after completion of a multisession treatment (mean, 8.2 months). Classification of VM was based on a modification of the Hamburg classification. Advanced diagnostic technology, mostly noninvasive, was used on 226 of 520 patients with congenital vascular malformation registered at the Congenital Vascular Malformation Clinic at the Samsung Medical Center. Of the 226 patients with VM, 87 with infiltrating extratruncular lesions had a total of 399 sessions of sclerotherapy. Follow-up assessment with periodic clinical examinations by the multidisciplinary team was supplemented with body blood pool scans, duplex scans, and magnetic resonance imaging, according to protocol, once the multisession therapy was completed. Angiographic assessment was seldom included. The endpoint of this phase II study was 24 months.\nOf 399 sessions, initial success was seen in 379 sessions (95.0%) and failure was seen in 20 sessions (5%). This was mostly caused by forced abandonment from technical difficulty in delivering ethanol safely to the lesion (eg, direct drainage of VM into normal deep vein system). Later results after completion of the multisession therapy with a minimum follow-up of 24 months on 71 VMs have shown no evidence of recurrence. Eighty-seven patients have shown the same results without recurrence on an average of 18.2 months of follow-up. Fifty-one minor to major complications, mostly skin damage, developed after 47 sessions among the 379 sessions (12.4% in 24/87 patients; 27.9%). However, complications resolved spontaneously or were managed successfully, except for one permanent facial nerve palsy and one peroneal nerve palsy.\nAbsolute ethanol sclerotherapy can deliver excellent results as an independent therapy to the infiltrating type of extratruncular form of VM, which was once taboo because of prohibitively high morbidity. Absolute ethanol may be accepted as an effective treatment method because no recurrence has been observed in the relatively long-term observation period and the morbidity has been acceptable. However, it should be reserved only for individuals and centers with expertise. The morbidity involved should be clearly understood and accepted by the patient or family, and the risk of acute and chronic complications, both major or minor, should be explained to the patient. Long-term assessment of the complication's sequelae is warranted.",

The morbidity involved should be clearly understood and accepted by the patient or family, and the risk of acute and chronic complications, both major or minor, should be explained to the patient. Long-term assessment of the complication's sequelae is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Pregnancy and the puerperium are time periods of an increased risk for venous thromboembolism. An ideal treatment should lead to complete restoration of the venous lumen, elimination of the embolic source, and prevention of severe postphlebitic syndrome. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin or thrombectomy are treatment options. In the current literature, these options are discussed controversially.\nFrom January 1982 to December 2001, 97 women underwent (93% transfemoral) thrombectomy and construction of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) for deep venous thrombosis related to pregnancy. The clinical and coagulation parameters were evaluated. The AVF was ligated 3 to 6 months later. Follow-up with duplex ultrasound scan, photoplethysmography, and strain-gauge plethysmography was completed in 87 women.\nSurgery was performed without any maternal death or pulmonary embolization. A cesarean section was carried out during the same anesthesia in 11 cases. Thrombectomy was completed with construction of a temporary AVF in 90 patients (92.8%). One fetal death occurred in the recovery room for unknown reasons. In the early postoperative course, 16 patients (16.5%) underwent redo surgery for rethrombosis with or without the occlusion of the fistula. In 14 of these patients, the venous system remained patent thereafter. Fetal or neonatal death occurred in five cases 2 to 10 weeks after surgery, mainly because of abruption of the placenta probably from anticoagulation. Among 247 preoperatively occluded anatomic regions, 221 could be restored, and the secondary patency rate amounted to 89.5%. After a mean follow-up period of 6 years, 49 patients (56.3%) were seen without a postphlebitic syndrome, and only three patients (3.5%) had had a leg ulcer develop.\nIn experienced hands, venous thrombectomy is a safe method to prevent pulmonary embolism and postphlebitic syndrome in women during pregnancy and the puerperium. The frequency of a severe postphlebitic syndrome after our surgical approach is lower than the rates published for anticoagulation treatment alone.",

    "abstract": "Lower extremity deep vein thrombosis is often isolated to the sinusoidal veins draining the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. The purpose of this study was to establish the incidence rate of propagation of isolated gastrocnemius and soleal vein thrombosis (IGSVT) into the deep veins of the calf and thigh.\nAll patients who were referred for color flow duplex ultrasonography (CFDU) for suspected deep vein thrombosis were prospectively evaluated for IGSVT. Patients with IGSVT received no systemic anticoagulation therapy and underwent serial CFDU at 5, 9, 14, 30, and 90 days after recruitment. The incidence and extent of IGSVT propagation were noted. Factors predictive of IGSVT extension were sought, including age, gender, side, symptoms, ambulatory status, and the presence of comorbid illness, including cardiac disease, cancer, hypercoagulable states, recent surgery or trauma, and previous venous disease.\nOne hundred thirty-five limbs with IGSVT were studied for 3 months, and 16.3% of cases with IGSVT extended the thrombus to the level of the adjacent tibial, or peroneal, veins or higher. Only 3% of the cases with IGSVT propagated as cephalad as the popliteal vein, and 90.9% of IGSVT propagation occurred within 2 weeks of CFDU diagnosis. No IGSVT propagated to the level of the popliteal vein beyond 2 weeks from the time of CFDU diagnosis. No IGSVT extended into the deep veins of the thigh. By the end of the 3-month study period, 45.9% of thrombi had completely resolved. Only the presence of cancer was prognostic for IGSVT progression.\nDuring the 3-month study period, the short-term incidence rate of untreated IGSVT propagation to the level of the popliteal vein, even in the presence of cancer, was only 3%. Follow-up imaging to detect IGSVT propagation beyond 2 weeks from the time of diagnosis may not be necessary.",

Although its most common cause is secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with renal failure, vascular surgeons are frequently called on to evaluate these nonhealing extremity wounds. We reviewed our experience of a multidisciplinary approach in treating patients with calciphylaxis and nonhealing ulcers.\nOver a 14-month period at a tertiary center, five patients were seen with calciphylaxis and nonhealing leg wounds. Demographics, disease characteristics, surgical treatment, and outcomes were analyzed.\nAll five patients were black women aged 40 +/- 8.9 years with hypertensive renal failure undergoing long-term hemodialysis (80 +/- 43 months). They had large, painful lower extremity wounds or necrotic ulcers (mean size, 135 cm(2)) that had developed over 2 to 4 months. Three patients had palpable pedal pulses, one patient had Doppler pedal signals, and one patient had absent pedal flow.

    "abstract": "The typical leg bypass surveillance program begins with a duplex scan evaluation of the vein graft 3 months after surgery; studies are repeated every 3 months during the first year of follow-up and are fully reimbursed by our Medicare carrier. Some authors have recommended early (before discharge or first postoperative visit) duplex scanning to identify high-risk grafts. However, the natural history of velocity disturbances detected with early scans is unclear, and furthermore, such studies are not reimbursed by Medicare.\nWe reviewed all infrainguinal vein bypass grafts prospectively entered into a surveillance protocol that included an early (<6 weeks) duplex scan study. Routine completion angiography was performed at the initial operation in all patients. Early duplex scan results, the need for graft revision, and detailed follow-up of these bypass grafts were analyzed.\nEarly duplex scans were performed in 224 bypass grafts placed in 204 patients. Early scans were abnormal (peak systolic velocity [PSV], >200 cm/s) in 58 grafts (26%). Six grafts of the 58 (10.3%; 2.7%) with an early abnormal duplex scan and unrepaired defects occluded during the follow-up period. Thirty grafts were revised on the basis of the initial early scan; 23 of these revisions were performed for critical or rapidly progressive lesions in the first 3 postoperative months. Seven lesions progressed more slowly and were repaired at a mean of 8 months after surgery. Interestingly, 22 flow abnormalities (37%) resolved or stabilized despite a PSV of more than 300 cm/s in six cases (27%). Clear duplex scan evidence of regression or progression of these early flow abnormalities occurred within 3 months in 51/58 cases (88%). A total of 68 grafts (30%) were revised during the entire study period; 30 of these (44%) were on the basis of the early abnormal scan.\nDespite normal completion arteriography, early graft velocity abnormalities are strikingly common and were detected in 26% of the 224 infrainguinal vein grafts in this series. These lesions were clinically important because 52% necessitated revision. Surprisingly, however, 38% of these early flow disturbances resolved, despite a PSV of more than 300 cm/s in 27% of cases. Early duplex scan surveillance singularly detects a clinically significant subgroup of grafts that need revision. The possible origin of these early lesions deserves further inquiry, but on the basis of its clinical yield, we recommend that early duplex scan surveillance of infrainguinal bypass grafts should be routine and should be considered for Medicare reimbursement.",

    "abstract": "Outcome with selective or systematic stenting with the Palmaz vascular stent was compared in patients with limb-threatening ischemia or persistent disabling claudication despite medical therapy, with less than 7 cm stenosis or occlusion of the superficial femoral artery.\nThis was a multicenter prospective randomized trial with centralized allocation of treatment and independent review of vascular events. The primary end point was presence of more than 50% stenosis at 1-year angiographic follow-up. Secondary end points were survival; occurrence of vascular events in the treated leg; and number of failed procedures, defined as more than 50% stenosis or death at 1 year.\nTwo hundred twenty-seven patients were enrolled in the study, 112 in the selective stent group, and 115 in the systematic stent group. Seventeen patients (15%) in the selective stent group received a stent after suboptimal results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Angiograms for 140 patients were available at 1-year follow-up and demonstrated no statistical difference between the two groups; more than 50% stenosis of the dilated site was noted in 21 of 65 patients (32,3%) in the selective stent group and 26 of 75 patients (34.7%) in the systematic stent group (P =.85, Fisher exact test). Survival in the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent groups was, respectively, 92% and 96% at 1 year, 89% and 93% at 2 years, and 82% and 80% at 4 years (P =.40, log-rank test). Survival free of new vascular events in the treated limb was 77% and 65% at 1 year, 70% and 53% at 2 years, and 57% and 44% at 4 years (P =.017, log-rank test). Number of failed procedures at 1 year was 29 of 86 (33%) and 30 of 89 (34%) (P = 0.9).\nSystematic stenting of short stenosis or occlusion of the superficial femoral artery is not justified. Palmaz vascular stent placement should be reserved for use in patients with suboptimal results of balloon angioplasty.",

Kaplan-Meier analyses of the primary outcome measures at 4 years indicate the following: a freedom from rupture rate of 98.4%; a freedom from surgical conversion rate of 90.4%; a freedom from aneurysm-related death rate of 96.9%; and a probability of survival rate, based on all-cause mortality, of 62.4%. Secondary outcome measures at 4 years include stent graft patency in 96.4%, endoleak in 13.9%, aneurysm enlargement in 11.5% and stent graft migration in 9.5% of patients.

    "abstract": "Distal embolization is a complication of aortoiliac aneurysm repair. Fluoroscopy-assisted catheter thromboembolectomy is useful in removing popliteal and tibial emboli from the femoral approach. Concomitant presence of aortoiliac and popliteal aneurysms, a known association, may present a difficult challenge to embolus extraction. Currently available embolectomy catheters large enough for thrombus extraction from a popliteal aneurysm are too large for safe tibial artery cannulation, and tibial balloon catheters cannot be enlarged sufficiently to transfer the thrombus through the aneurysmal popliteal segment. We treated a patient who embolized to his popliteal aneurysm and distal tibial circulation following aortoiliac aneurysm repair. A fluoroscopy-assisted dual-catheter technique was used to extract the thrombus through the femoral approach, eliminating the need for direct popliteal or tibial exploration. This technique uses two balloon catheters of graduated size, maneuvered concurrently under fluoroscopic guidance into the tibial and popliteal circulation. The smaller tibial catheter is inflated, and thrombus is withdrawn into the popliteal segment. The larger popliteal balloon catheter is then inflated distal to the smaller catheter, and both catheters are withdrawn simultaneously to deliver the clot through the femoral arteriotomy. This technique can be useful for successful balloon catheter extraction of thrombus via remote access, in an arterial system with variable diameter, eliminating the need for direct popliteal or tibial exploration.",

The obturator canal technique has been used to bypass an infected field in the groin, although this method has not always been definitive because of several drawbacks. We present a unique method of extra-anatomic revascularization for use in such a situation. An autogenous graft is placed just below the sartorius muscle in the thigh and penetrates the iliacus muscle near the lateral end of the inguinal ligament. Limb loss and recurrent infection are prevented postoperatively. This retro-sartorius bypass technique may be a useful alternative to obturator bypass grafting in selected patients.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic nucleotide-dependent relaxation of vascular smooth muscle is associated with increases in the phosphorylation of the small heat shock-related protein, HSP20. To determine whether phosphorylated HSP20 directly mediates relaxation, we used gene transfection and protein transduction of HSP20 analogues. Rat mesangial cells were transfected with constructs containing wild-type HSP20-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), phosphorylation site mutated HSP20 (S16A-HSP20-EGFP), or EGFP alone. Contractile properties were determined on a silicone polymer substrata. In the presence of serum, EGFP-vector transfected control cells and S16A-HSP20 transfected cells formed wrinkles on the polymer (contracted). Activation of cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways in the EGFP-vector transfected control cells led to a time-dependent decrease in the wrinkles (relaxation). The S16A-HSP20 transfected cells were refractory to cyclic nucleotide-dependent relaxation. Cells overexpressing the wild-type HSP20 did not form wrinkles on the polymer in response to serum (refractory to contraction). Treatment of precontracted strips of intact bovine carotid artery smooth muscle with synthetic peptides containing HIV-trans-activating transcriptional activator and a phosphopeptide motif of HSP20 led to dose-dependent relaxation. These data provide evidence that phosphorylated HSP20 has a direct role in smooth muscle relaxation and that small phosphopeptide motifs of HSP20 can mimic the effects of the entire molecule.",

    "abstract": "Neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) is complete by 3 weeks in rabbit vein grafts implanted into the arterial circulation. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of protein kinases is thought to be critical in remodeling events such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and migration, as found in NIH. We previously demonstrated that antisense basic fibroblast growth factor (ASbFGF) inhibited the synthesis of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the balloon injury model of NIH. We examined the effect of ASbFGF on NIH and the time course of MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and p38 kinase activation in arterialized vein grafts.\nCarotid interposition of a vein bypass graft was performed in 75 New Zealand White rabbits. Segments of the external jugular vein were transfected with a replication-deficient adenovirus containing the messenger RNA sequence for rat ASbFGF at 1 x 10(10) plaque-forming units per milliliter; control animals were given phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) alone. Rabbits were killed at 30 minutes, 4 days, 7 days, and 21 days (n = 8). Four grafts in each group were fixed with formalin and embedded in paraffin, then processed with elastin-collagen and hematoxylin-eosin stains. The other four grafts were individually frozen, and total protein was extracted. Phosphorylation of MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK, and p38, was determined with Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Groups were compared with analysis of variance.\nThe thickness of neointima in the PBS group and the ASbFGF group at 21 days was 60.2 +/- 2.1 and 39.4 +/- 2.1 microm, respectively (P <.01). In both the control and ASbFGF groups, all 3 MAPKs demonstrated activation compared with preimplantation levels. However, when compared with the PBS group the ASbFGF group showed greater than 33% inhibition of all three MAPKs by day 4 and day 7 (P <.05), but no significant difference in any MAPK activation by day 21 (P >.05, all groups). Cells staining positive for activated MAPK were found in the neointima and adventitia of vein grafts in both the PBS and ASbFGF groups.\nMAPKs are activated during the first week after vein graft implantation. Grafts treated with ASbFGF demonstrated reduced MAPK activation and less neointimal thickening. These results suggest that the process of vein graft adaptation to the arterial circulation, and subsequent NIH, may depend on basic fibroblast growth factor activity, which is mediated, at least in part, by a MAPK-dependent mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Increasing need for and potential shortage of blood products have intensified the search for alternative oxygen carriers. A solution to this problem could be use of the bovine hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier HBOC-201. While hemodynamic reactions to cell-free hemoglobin have been studied, little knowledge exists about tissue oxygenation properties of hemoglobin solutions, especially in comparison with red blood cells (RBCs).\nTissue oxygenation in skeletal muscle of 12 anesthetized dogs was examined after decrease of hemoglobin concentrations by means of hemodilution to hematocrit 10% and subsequent transfusion with either HBOC-201 or autologous banked RBCs. In addition to hemodynamic parameters, blood gas concentrations and oxygen content in arterial and muscular venous blood, tissue oxygen tension (tPO(2)) were measured in the gastrocnemius muscle with a polarographic needle probe.\nHemodilution increased muscular blood flow and oxygen extraction and decreased tPO(2). Transfusion decreased muscular oxygen extraction in the RBC group but not in the HBOC-201 group (P <.01). The 10th percentile of tPO(2) increased by 400% after the first dose of HBOC-201 (P <.001 vs posthemodilution) but only by 33% after equivalent RBC transfusion (P <.01 vs HBOC-201). Increases in the 50th (120%, P <.05) and 90th (31%) percentiles and all percentiles of tPO(2) after the second and third HBOC-201 dose were less pronounced but higher than in the RBC group.\nCompared with RBC transfusion, infusion of low doses of HBOC-201 maintain enhanced oxygen extraction after extended hemodilution and provide faster and higher increase in muscular tissue PO(2).",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury may be initiated by a number of mediators, including reactive oxygen species. Recent studies have shown that human MutY homologue (hMYH), human 8-oxo-7,8-dihydrodeoxyguanine (8-oxoG) glycosylase (hOGG1), and human MutS homologue 2 (hMSH2) are important DNA mismatch repair genes. We hypothesized that ischemia-reperfusion injury in spinal cord causes DNA damage manifested by 8-oxoG production and activates the DNA repair system involving hMYH, hOGG1, and hMSH2.\nSpinal cords of rabbits were removed at 1, 3, 6, 24, and 48 hours after 30 minutes of infrarenal aortic occlusion. DNA damage was determined with 8-oxoG staining. The expression and localization of DNA repair enzymes, such as hMYH, hOGG1, and hMSH2, were studied with Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining. The level of apoptosis was determined with TUNEL study. Activation of caspase-3, an enzyme induced by cellular injury that leads to apoptosis by degrading cellular structural proteins, was also studied.\nDNA damage monitored with 8-oxoG level was significantly present from 1 hour to 6 hours after reperfusion in gray matter neurons of ischemic spinal cord. The levels of hMYH, hOGG1, and hMSH2 were markedly increased in gray matter neurons at 6 hours after reperfusion. Caspase-3 was also induced at 6 hours to 24 hours after reperfusion in ischemic spinal cord. However, the peak level of TUNEL reactivity was found at 48 hours after reperfusion in spinal cord neurons.\nThis study has shown, for the first time, the rapid expression of DNA damage-repair processes associated with spinal cord ischemia and subsequent reperfusion.",

    "abstract": "The lack of aneurysm pulsatility after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is deemed by some an important guide to the effectiveness of exclusion. However, factors that contribute to aneurysm pulsatility after EVAR have not been elucidated. This study quantitatively analyzed the effects of systemic pressure, aneurysm sac pressure, endoleak, branch outflow from aneurysm sac, and intra-sac thrombus on aneurysm pulsatility after EVAR.\nIn an ex vivo model, an artificial aneurysm sac was incorporated within a mock circulation comprised of rubber tubing and a pulsatile pump. The aneurysm sac was then completely excluded from the circulatory circuit with two types of stent-grafts, ie, supported and unsupported, and heparinized canine blood was circulated. Systemic circulation and aneurysm sac pressure was recorded in the absence and presence of endoleaks, and simulated open and closed lumbar branch outflow from the aneurysm sac. The aneurysm sac was then filled with organized human thrombus, and all pressure measurements were repeated. Two observers blinded to the above-mentioned variables independently evaluated aneurysm sac pulsatility with palpation in five separate experiments. Analysis of variance was performed, with significance accepted at P =.05.\nSystemic pressure was simulated in the artificial circulation to range from 100/60 to 180/60 mm Hg. Regardless of the simulated lumbar branch outflow from the aneurysm, sac pressure was directly related to the presence of endoleak (P <.001). Aneurysm sac pulsatility was present only when the lumbar branch outflow was patent and not dependent on sac pressures. Aneurysm sac thrombosis or type of stent-graft did not influence sac pressure and pulsatility.\nIn this model, after EVAR pulsatility depends on aneurysm sac outflow, regardless of endoleak, sac thrombosis, sac pressure, or stent-graft. Furthermore, persistent pulsatility does not predict systemic intra-sac pressure, nor does lack of pulsatility reflect freedom of the aneurysm sac from systemic pressurization. This ex vivo model suggests that aneurysm pulsatility is an unreliable guide for predicting aneurysm sac pressurization after EVAR. Other diagnostic methods must be used to assess successful aneurysm exclusion.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to express quantitatively and noninvasively the efficiency of the venomuscular pump by using photoplethysmography (PPG). METHODS AND PATIENTS PPG was used to record volume changes induced by dorsiflexion resulting in exercise displacement volume (EDV) and subsequently by passive limb elevation resulting in tilt displacement volume (TDV). Dividing EDV by TDV yields efficiency of the venomuscular pump. Twenty-four control subjects, 21 patients with venous valvular insufficiency (VVI), and 10 additional patients with both VVI and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) were studied. Data for one leg in each subject are reported. Though calculation of efficiency does not require calibrated or quantitative PPG, in this case because we used calibrated PPG we recorded the respective values for EDV after dorsiflexion and TDV after passive leg elevation.\nEDV decreased from a normal value of 3.15% optical reflectance (% OR) to 1.68% OR in patients with VVI and 1.09% OR in patients with VVI plus DVT. TDV response was quite opposite, increasing from 6.55% OR in the control group to 10.30% OR in the VVI group and 16.66% OR in the VVI plus DVT group. Finally, efficiency decreased from the average normal value of 50.5% to 24.4% in the VVI group and 8.8% in the VVI plus DVT group.\nDividing EDV by TDV, venomuscular efficiency can be determined and may be considered a useful index of venous hemodynamics.",

    "abstract": "Clinical classifications attempt to summarize a large amount of information in a few indices. CEAP is the most comprehensive and widely used classification of chronic venous disorders. The objective was to evaluate, in a routine clinical setting, the information associated with each CEAP clinical class and their ascending severity and additivity.\nThis work was a multicenter evaluation of newly designed software dedicated to the management of venous diseases. Forty-nine angiologists from nine European countries entered a total of 872 full records of unselected patients. The data were analyzed to evaluate the informational value of each of the clinical classes and to test their ascending severity and additivity, with monovariate and multivariate statistical techniques with SPSS/PC software on the database of the 872 right lower limbs.\nThe series consisted of 700 women (80.3%) and 172 men, aged 18 to 100 years (median, 53 years). The ascending severity of the classes was shown with the statistical association of higher severity C classes with the age of the patient, a history of previous deep vein thrombosis, the diameter class of the most dilated varicose vein, venous symptoms, and the presence of a corona phlebectatica. The additivity, as measured with the Cronbach alpha coefficient analysis, was satisfactory in highest classes but poorer within the first three classes, and factor analysis of correspondences showed the heterogeneity of the variables that make the classification.\nThe information summarized with the CEAP clinical classes shows a good ascending severity but a poorer additivity. These limitations seem to be related to the heterogeneity of the information content, which suggests some refinements of this basic tool for clinical research in the field of chronic venous disorders.",

    "abstract": "Easy access to the vascular system is vital in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing long-term hemodialysis. Such patients often require multiple operations, and options for secondary or tertiary access procedures become increasingly limited. Brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistula offers excellent access in such difficult cases and is increasingly preferred over prosthetic grafts. Many surgical techniques have been described to create such fistulas. The purpose of this study was to determine the difference in long-term patency and dialysis-related complications among various techniques.\nSeventy brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistulas were constructed in 70 patients. This was the secondary or tertiary access in 88.6% of patients. The basilic vein was transposed in 30 patients and elevated in 40 patients; twenty veins were elevated with a one-stage technique, and 20 were elevated with a two-stage (delayed elevation) technique.\nThe early failure rate was 5.7% in the entire group. Sixty-six fistulas (94.3%) were successfully used for dialysis. Mean follow-up was 25.8 months (range, 4-36 months). Four fistulas (5.7%) required additional procedures during follow-up, 2 in the transposed vein group and 2 in the elevated vein group. Cumulative secondary patency rate, measured with the Kaplan-Meier survival method, was 86.7%, 90%, and 84.2% at 1 year for the transposed, one-stage, and two-stage elevation procedures, respectively, compared with 82.8%, 70%, and 68.4% at 2 years. The difference was statistically nonsignificant. Forty-two complications developed in 29 (43.9%) fistulas. Thirteen fistulas (19.7%) had more than one complication. Twelve complications in 10 fistulas (35.7%) were recorded in the transposition group, 15 complications in 9 fistulas (47.4%) in the one-stage elevation group, and 15 complications in 10 fistulas (52.6%) in the two-stage elevation group. The total complication rate was higher in the elevated fistulas (71.4% vs 28.6%); the difference was statistically highly significant (P <.001). The most common complication was arm edema (21.2%; n = 14), followed by puncture site-related hematoma (16.7%; n = 11) and thrombosis (16.7%; n = 11). Hematoma was statistically more common (P <.05) in the elevated vein group (26.3% vs 3.6%). The difference in thrombosis between the transposition and elevation groups (23.7% vs 7.1%) was not significant. Hematoma preceded thrombosis in 63.7% (7 of 11) of the fistulas, and it was the major predisposing factor for fistula failure. Transposed vein was easier to manage by dialysis staff. All nurses were satisfied with the transposed veins, but only 53.3% were satisfied with the elevated veins; the difference was statistically highly significant (P <.001).\nAvailable techniques for creating brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistula are associated with good patency rate, and most related complications can be treated conservatively without loss of the fistula. Among the various procedures, transposition has a lower complication rate and is favored by the dialysis staff dealing with such fistulas.",

    "abstract": "Patients with severe peripheral occlusive disease may present especially challenging problems because of previous bypass surgery, location of ulcers, or extremely poor runoff. We used the radial artery with its overlying skin flap as a bypass conduit, called the radial artery flow-through (RAFT) graft in 10 such patients.\nFrom November 1999 to January 2002, 10 patients had limb-threatening ischemia at presentation. All had severe inframalleolar vascular occlusive disease. Four patients had undergone previous conventional bypass procedures. Two grafts remained patent, but distal ulcers failed to heal. Eight patients were men. Seven patients had diabetes mellitus. All patients but one had nonhealing ulcers. In most cases, a composite femoral-tibial bypass graft was constructed by sewing the RAFT graft end-to-end to either the greater saphenous vein or, in one patient, to a polytetrafluoroethylene graft. In all cases, the radial venous comitans were sewn to a nearby superficial vein. In 5 patients the skin paddle was positioned to cover the ulcer; in the remaining patients the skin paddle was used to close the foot incision over the distal anastamosis. Postoperative graft surveillance was performed with Duplex scanning or contrast medium-enhanced angiography.\nThromboses developed in 2 grafts during follow-up. In 1 of these patients below-knee amputation was performed. Another patient required below-knee amputation because of continuing infection in the foot despite a patent RAFT graft. In 1 patient thrombosis developed in the vein graft, but the RAFT graft extension remained patent. All other RAFT grafts were patent in their entirety at 15 (+/-6) months.\nThe RAFT graft is a new option for treating limb-threatening ischemia. The skin paddle may be useful in selected patients for wound coverage.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to define total long-term outcome achievable with invasive treatment, ie, endovascular or surgical, in patients with claudication with infrainguinal lesions. Priority in primary treatment was given to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.\nData were analyzed for 233 consecutive patients with claudication in whom primary infrainguinal revascularization was performed in 304 limbs between 1989 and 1992. Patients were followed-up to May 2001 (mean, 81 months). Treatment included primary endovascular therapy when applicable (n = 272 limbs) or primary surgical treatment (n = 32; 10.5%). Type of further revascularization, if required, was selected on an individual basis for each patient. All procedures performed because of limb ischemia were recorded. Clinical outcome at the end of follow-up was compared with the preoperative condition. Cumulative primary, secondary, and total patency rates and development of chronic critical ischemia (CCI) were defined. Total patency reflects the ultimate achievable benefit of invasive treatment and refers to patency maintained at the primarily treated segment by means of any invasive (endovascular or surgical) therapy, including potential crossover to another treatment group.\nA mean of 2 (median, 1) operations per limb were performed during follow-up. No additional operations were needed in 50.3% (n = 153) of limbs. Fontaine classification at the end of the study was better compared with the preoperative value (P <.0005). Crossover between endovascular and surgical treatment was recorded in 21.1% (n = 64) of limbs. At 5 years, primary, secondary, and total patency rates (plus or minus standard error of estimate [SEE]) were 27% +/- 3%, 45% +/- 3%, and 61% +/- 3%, respectively, and at 10 years these rates were 16% +/- 3%, 27% +/- 3%, and 41% +/- 3%. CCI developed in 37 limbs (12.2%), of which 15 (41%) had been treated with endovascular methods only. Type II diabetes and hypertension were statistically significant predictors of increased risk for CCI.\nCombining endovascular and surgical methods when necessary improved total outcome of invasive infrainguinal treatment of claudication. Crossover between endovascular and surgical treatment was required in 21% of limbs over the long term.",

Progressive changes in vein graft geometry were measured at sites of repaired stenoses with three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging.\nTen vein graft revisions with patch angioplasty were followed up for 31 to 47 weeks. Four revisions were at valve sites, and six were at sites of diffuse intimal hyperplasia. Sets of spatially registered two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional ultrasound images were assembled to create 3D computer models of each vein graft. Cross-sectional area measurements in planes normal to the vessel center axis were calculated from the 3D surface reconstructions. Data sets from serial studies were registered in a common coordinate system, and cross-sectional area measurements were compared at matched sites.\nThree of the four vein graft revisions at valve sites changed by less than 18%, and one decreased in cross-sectional area by 61%. Five of the six revisions at sites of diffuse intimal hyperplasia demonstrated significant decreases in lumen area ranging from 26% to 61%, and one revision exhibited no significant change in cross-sectional area. Reproducibility of the cross-sectional area measurements derived from the 3D imaging technique was 6.9%.\nSequential area measurements from 3D ultrasound scans demonstrated different remodeling patterns and rates of change among revision sites within the vein grafts.

    "abstract": "Hemodynamically relevant internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis is a major cause of ischemic stroke. Despite its long-term benefit, carotid endarterectomy may also be associated with severe neurologic deficits. Intraoperative and early recognition of ischemia in the region of the ICA may reduce this risk. To date, direct imaging and quantitative analysis of microvascular structures and function in the human ICA region have not been possible. We purposed to visualize and quantify ischemia/reperfusion-induced microcirculatory changes in the terminal vascular bed of the ICA in patients undergoing unilateral ICA endarterectomy.\nSequential analysis of the ipsilateral and contralateral conjunctival microcirculation was performed with orthogonal polarized spectral imaging in 33 patients undergoing unilateral ICA endarterectomy because of moderate or severe ICA stenosis (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial score, 75% +/- 13%), before clamping the ICA (baseline), during clamping of the external carotid artery and ICA, during reperfusion of the ICA (intraluminal shunt), during the second clamping of the ICA (shunt removal), after declamping (reperfusion) of the external carotid artery and ICA, and 15 to 20 minutes after the second ICA reperfusion.\nDuring ICA clamping for shunt placement, ipsilateral and contralateral conjunctival capillary perfusion was significantly decreased, but it was completely restored after reperfusion with carotid shunting. Reclamping of the ICA for shunt removal caused microvascular dysfunction, which was significantly less pronounced than that observed during the first clamping. The individual degree of ICA stenosis was inversely correlated with the ipsilateral and contralateral decrease in conjunctival functional capillary density during the first ICA clamping.\nThese results suggest adaptive mechanisms of capillary perfusion with increasing stenosis and development of collateral compensatory circulation in the vascular region of the human ICA. Conjunctival orthogonal polarized spectral imaging during unilateral ICA reconstruction enables continuous noninvasive analysis of bilateral conjunctival microcirculation in the terminal region of the ICA and enables monitoring for efficient carotid shunt perfusion during and after endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "Nonoperative treatment of recent internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion is associated with increased recurrent stroke rates. We analyzed our results of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for treatment of symptomatic recent ICA occlusion to evaluate its feasibility, safety, and outcomes.\nFrom 1990 to 2002, all patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA), amaurosis fugax, and minor stroke underwent duplex ultrasound (US) scanning and arteriography to confirm the diagnosis of ICA occlusion. Within 2 weeks of symptom onset, patients underwent operative exploration with attempted CEA. ICA occlusion was detected at preoperative angiography and confirmed at surgery. Patients with extensive ICA plaque not amenable to endarterectomy underwent external CEA with ICA ligation.\nOver 12 years, 87 patients with symptomatic ICA occlusion underwent 90 operations for ICA exploration. In 30 patients (18 men, 12 women) with TIA (45%), amaurosis fugax (19%), or minor stroke (36%), CEA to treat ICA occlusion was technically successful. There was 1 postoperative stroke, 2 asymptomatic internal carotid occlusions, and no restenoses (mean follow-up, 26 months; range, 1-93 months). In 57 patients (37 men, 20 women) with TIA (41%), amaurosis fugax (27%), or stroke (32%) in whom CEA was unsuccessful, external CEA was performed. In this group there were no postoperative strokes, 2 asymptomatic external carotid artery occlusions, and 1 restenosis (>70%) (mean follow-up, 22 months; range, 1-73 months). There were no late strokes in either group.\nOperative exploration and endarterectomy to treat symptomatic ICA occlusion is feasible and safe. Patients with symptomatic ICA occlusion should be considered candidates for CEA.",

    "abstract": "It is believed that cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) is caused by loss of cerebral autoregulation resulting from chronic cerebral ischemia and that factors including increased intraoperative cerebral blood flow, ipsilateral or contralateral carotid disease, and postoperative hypertension may cause CHS. We describe our experience with CHS, which diverges from published reports.\nFrom March 2000 to February 2002 we performed 455 carotid endarterectomy (CEA) procedures in 404 patients at our institution. CHS developed 1 to 8 days (mean, 3.2 +/- 2.5 days) postoperatively in 9 patients (2%), 6 women and 3 men, whose age ranged from 52 to 84 years (mean, 69 +/- 8 years). Indications for surgery in 8 patients without neurologic symptoms were ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenoses ranging from 70% to 99% (mean, 80% +/- 7%); the remaining patient had an ipsilateral stroke, with good clinical recovery, 7 weeks before CEA. Only 1 patient had significant contralateral ICA stenosis (70%). However, 5 patients had undergone contralateral CEA within the previous 3 months. CHS symptoms were severe headache in 5 patients, seizures in 3 patients (1 stroke), and visual disturbance and ataxia in 1 patient. All 404 patients (455 cases) underwent intraoperative and early (2 weeks) postoperative carotid artery duplex scanning. The 9 patients with CHS also underwent carotid artery duplex scanning at the time of the neurologic event.\nMean intraoperative ICA volume flow (MICAVF) in the 9 CHS cases was not significantly different from that in the other 446 cases (170 +/- 47 mL/min and 182 +/- 81 mL/min, respectively). However, mean ICA volume flow (481 +/- 106 mL/min) and peak systolic velocity (PSV) (108 +/- 33 cm/s) for the 9 CHS cases measured at onset of symptoms were higher than those for the remaining 446 cases (267 +/- 87 mL/min and 80 +/- 26 cm/s, respectively) (P <.01). Of the 9 patients with CHS, only 3 had systolic blood pressures more than 160 mm Hg at onset of symptoms. Severity of ipsilateral and contralateral ICA stenoses was not significantly different between the 9 CHS cases and the remaining 446 cases.\nThese data do not corroborate the common belief that CHS occurs preferentially in patients with severe ipsilateral or contralateral carotid disease, increased intraoperative cerebral perfusion, or severe hypertension. Recently performed contralateral CEA (<3 months) appears to be predictive of CHS.",

    "abstract": "Results of surgical revascularization in 25 patients with renal artery dissection (RAD) over 14 years, with mean follow-up of 55.3 months (range, 10-111 months), were analyzed. Indications for surgery were renovascular hypertension and preservation or improvement of kidney function.\nTwo patients (both 20 years of age) underwent emergency surgery after severe trauma; 23 patients (mean age, 41 years) underwent elective surgery in a chronic stage of disease. Preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up examinations included duplex ultrasound scanning, determination of serum creatinine and urea concentrations, and evaluation of blood pressure control. All long-term patients underwent digital subtraction angiography preoperatively and postoperatively. All histologic specimens of resected renal arteries were re-evaluated by two independent pathologists.\nHistologic re-evaluation confirmed the traumatic origin in 2 patients who underwent emergency surgery and 1 who underwent elective surgery. Renal artery dissection developed spontaneously, with no histologic signs of trauma or fibromuscular dysplasia, in 22 patients. In 17 revascularized kidneys (61%) a kidney infarction had already developed preoperatively, and the kidneys were diminished in size or function. Results of revascularization and improvement of hypertension depended on preoperative extent of renal infarction. Hypertension resolved or improved in 86% of patients without preoperative kidney damage, but in only 38% with preoperatively damaged kidneys. Kidney function was preserved in 23 of 28 revascularized kidneys (82%). During follow-up, late renal artery occlusion developed in 3 kidneys.\nRenal artery dissection can be effectively treated with surgical revascularization. Primary nephrectomy should be considered only in patients with a large ischemic kidney infarction, with significant deterioration of kidney function, to effectively cure or improve severe renovascular hypertension.",

    "abstract": "We undertook this study to determine whether popliteal artery aneurysm diameter correlates with initial symptoms and presence of associated occlusive disease.\nDuplex arteriography before infrainguinal revascularization in 500 lower extremities enabled diagnosis of 34 popliteal aneurysms in 25 patients (24 male, 1 female) over the last 4 years. Fourteen patients (41%) had no symptoms (group 1) and 20 (59%) had symptoms (group 2) of severe claudication (n = 8), acute ischemia (n = 6), rest pain (n = 2), and tissue loss (n = 4). We compared clinical presentation with popliteal artery diameter, prevalence of thrombosis, and presence of associated occlusive disease.\nPopliteal artery aneurysm diameter averaged 2.8 +/- 0.7 cm (range, 1.8-4.5 cm) in group 1 and 2.2 +/- 0.8 cm (range, 1.3-4.0 cm) in group 2 (P <.03). Popliteal aneurysm thrombosis was present in 7 of 20 limbs in group 2. Four of these patients also had ipsilateral superficial femoral artery thrombosis. Evaluation of the infrapopliteal arteries in group 1 showed three-vessel runoff in 7 limbs, two-vessel runoff in 3 limbs, one-vessel runoff in 2 limbs, and no vessel runoff in 2 limbs. However, all infrapopliteal arteries were either occluded or significantly stenotic in 14 limbs (70%). In group 2, one-vessel runoff was observed in 5 limbs, and two-vessel runoff in 1 limb.\nSmaller popliteal artery aneurysm was associated with higher incidence of thrombosis, clinical symptoms, and distal occlusive disease. Liberal use of duplex scanning in this setting may have accounted for the increased awareness that small popliteal artery aneurysms can thrombose and present with severe ischemia.",

Evaluation of the infrapopliteal arteries in group 1 showed three-vessel runoff in 7 limbs, two-vessel runoff in 3 limbs, one-vessel runoff in 2 limbs, and no vessel runoff in 2 limbs. However, all infrapopliteal arteries were either occluded or significantly stenotic in 14 limbs (70%). In group 2, one-vessel runoff was observed in 5 limbs, and two-vessel runoff in 1 limb.",

    "abstract": "Delayed neurologic deficit after thoracoabdominal or thoracic aortic repair is an unusual complication. We previously examined the preoperative risk factors associated with immediate neurologic deficit to consider their relationship to delayed neurologic deficit. In the current study we wanted to determine whether postoperative events influence the likelihood of delayed neurologic deficit, independent of preoperative risk factors.\nWe studied postoperative hemodynamics and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drain function in patients who had delayed neurologic deficit (cases) and those who did not (controls). Our database contains data for 854 patients with descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Cases and controls were identified with a random number generator to select controls in an approximate 4:1 ratio. We identified 18 cases and 67 controls. Further data were obtained from medical records.\nWe found no differences between the groups with regard to oxygen transport abnormalities, eg, pneumothorax, repeat intubation, cardiac arrest, atrial or ventricular dysrhythmia, or dialysis. Significant differences between the groups were present for CSF drain complications (eg, kinks, blood in CSF): 6 of 18 (33%) in the case group versus 3 of 67 (4.5%) in the control group (P <.003). Wide fluctuation in mean arterial pressure (MAP) was significant (P <.02), mainly because of very low MAP in the cases (P <.006). When odds ratio was adjusted for preoperative risk factors of extent II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, acute aortic dissection, and chronic aortic dissection, MAP less than 60 mm Hg and CSF drain complications produced the highest odds of delayed neurologic deficit.\nNo single risk factor explained the onset of delayed deficit. Rather, a combination of factors, especially lowest MAP and drain complications, produced the highest odds of deficit. Vigilant optimization of hemodynamics and immediate correction of CSF drain malfunction may prevent development of delayed neurologic deficit.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to evaluate the consequences on patient selection and on early and mid-term results during the learning curve of a surgical team performing laparoscopy-assisted surgery to treat abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nBetween December 1998 and January 2002, 24 patients (22 men, 2 women; mean age, 68.2 years [range, 57-82 years]) were included in a prospective study and underwent laparoscopic transperitoneal AAA dissection followed by graft implantation through a 6 to 9 cm minilaparotomy. Perioperative data for the first 10 patients, obtained during the first 25 months of the study (group 1), were compared with data for the last 14 patients, obtained during the last 13 months of the study (group 2). Follow-up consisted of clinical examination or duplex scanning, or both, at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter, and computed tomographic scanning before discharge and yearly thereafter.\nOne patient (4.3%) died in the immediate postoperative period. In this patient and two others (12.5%), the minilaparotomy was extended intraoperatively, from 12 cm to 16 cm. With experience, initial contraindications such as obesity and short proximal or calcified aortic neck were eliminated, enabling increase in rate of patients included, from 27.7% during the first 25 first months to 56% during the last 13 months (P =.063). Mean duration of operative clamping decreased from 275 minutes in group 1 to 195 minutes in group 2 (P <.0001), and mean duration of aortic clamping decreased from 101 minutes in group 1 to 52 minutes in group 2 (P <.0001). The number of early repeat interventions was reduced from 3 (30%) in group 1 to 2 (14.3%) in group 2 (P =.61), and clinical recovery period decreased from 6.8 days to 4.3 days (P <.005). During mean follow-up of 17.1 months (range, 3-38 months), no late aortoiliac procedures were necessary and no prosthetic abnormality was detected.\nThis minimally invasive video-assisted technique provides good postoperative comfort and excellent mid-term results. Developments in experience and instrumentation have enabled us to include a growing number of patients and to reduce the duration of the procedure.",

    "abstract": "Approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration of endoluminal repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with the AneuRx stent graft was based on the outcome of a multicenter trial in which patients met strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Since widespread use of the commercially available graft, little information is available as to whether indications and outcomes have evolved. We examined this important issue at our institution.\nData concerning indications, repair, and follow-up for all patients undergoing endoluminal repair of AAA was prospectively entered into a patient registry. Group 1 comprised consecutive patients enrolled in the AneuRx Phase III clinical trial between November 1998 and September 2000. Group 2 consisted of consecutive patients who underwent implantation of the commercially available AneuRx graft between May 1999 and June 2001.\nGroup 1 included 42 patients (mean age, 72 years), and group 2 included 54 patients (mean age, 73 years). Patient demographics and risk factors were similar between the two groups. Maximum aortic aneurysm diameter was significantly greater (P =.021) in group 1 (55 mm +/- 10.9 [SD] mm) compared with group 2 (52 +/- 15.6 mm). Maximum infrarenal aortic neck length was significantly longer (P =.022) in group 1 (30 +/- 11.7 mm) than in group 2 (23 +/- 12.0 mm). Maximum left common iliac artery diameter in group 1 (13.0 +/- 3.2 mm) was significantly smaller (P =.032) than that in group 2 (14 +/- 6.5 mm). During follow-up, no differences were observed for number of endoleaks, subsequent interventions, or graft explantation between the two groups.\nIn group 2 patients AAAs were significantly smaller, infrarenal aortic neck length was shorter, and left common iliac arteries were larger. Common iliac artery ectasia and aneurysmal disease has become another indication for use of the AneuRx commercial graft at our institution, with no significant differences in intermediate outcome. Given the possibility for evolving indications compared with trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, institutions that use the AneuRx commercial graft should prospectively monitor outcomes for quality assurance.",

    "abstract": "We previously showed that peak abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) wall stress calculated for aneurysms in vivo is higher at rupture than at elective repair. The purpose of this study was to analyze rupture risk over time in patients under observation.\nComputed tomography (CT) scans were analyzed for patients with AAA when observation was planned for at least 6 months. AAA wall stress distribution was computationally determined in vivo with CT data, three-dimensional computer modeling, finite element analysis (nonlinear hyperelastic model depicting aneurysm wall behavior), and blood pressure during observation.\nAnalysis included 103 patients and 159 CT scans (mean follow-up, 14 +/- 2 months per CT). Forty-two patients were observed with no intervention for at least 1 year (mean follow-up, 28 +/- 3 months). Elective repair was performed within 1 year in 39 patients, and emergent repair was performed in 22 patients (mean, 6 +/- 1 month after CT) for rupture (n = 14) or acute severe pain. Significant differences were found for initial diameter (observation, 4.9 +/-.1 cm; elective repair, 5.9 +/-.1 cm; emergent repair, 6.1 +/-.2 cm; P <.0001) and initial peak wall stress (38 +/- 1 N/cm(2), 42 +/- 2 n/cm(2), 58 +/- 4 N/cm(2), respectively; P <.0001), but peak wall stress appeared to better differentiate patients who later required emergent repair (elective vs emergent repair: diameter, 3% difference, P =.5; stress, 38% difference, P <.0001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for predicting rupture were better for peak wall stress (sensitivity, 94%; specificity,81%; accuracy, 85% [with 44 N/cm(2) threshold]) than for diameter (81%, 70%, 73%, respectively [with optimal 5.5 cm threshold). With proportional hazards analysis, peak wall stress (relative risk, 25x) and gender (relative risk, 3x) were the only significant independent predictors of rupture.\nFor AAAs under observation, peak AAA wall stress seems superior to diameter in differentiating patients who will experience catastrophic outcome. Elevated wall stress associated with rupture is not simply an acute event near the time of rupture.",

    "results": "Analysis included 103 patients and 159 CT scans (mean follow-up, 14 +/- 2 months per CT). Forty-two patients were observed with no intervention for at least 1 year (mean follow-up, 28 +/- 3 months). Elective repair was performed within 1 year in 39 patients, and emergent repair was performed in 22 patients (mean, 6 +/- 1 month after CT) for rupture (n = 14) or acute severe pain. Significant differences were found for initial diameter (observation, 4.9 +/-.1 cm; elective repair, 5.9 +/-.1 cm; emergent repair, 6.1 +/-.2 cm; P <.0001) and initial peak wall stress (38 +/- 1 N/cm(2), 42 +/- 2 n/cm(2), 58 +/- 4 N/cm(2), respectively; P <.0001), but peak wall stress appeared to better differentiate patients who later required emergent repair (elective vs emergent repair: diameter, 3% difference, P =.5; stress, 38% difference, P <.0001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for predicting rupture were better for peak wall stress (sensitivity, 94%; specificity,81%; accuracy, 85% [with 44 N/cm(2) threshold]) than for diameter (81%, 70%, 73%, respectively [with optimal 5.5 cm threshold). With proportional hazards analysis, peak wall stress (relative risk, 25x) and gender (relative risk, 3x) were the only significant independent predictors of rupture.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to determine whether abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) regression is different with various endografts after endovascular repair.\nA four-center retrospective review of size change after endovascular AAA repair was performed. Consecutive patients with at least 1-year follow-up and available imaging studies were included. Three hundred ninety patients received either the Ancure, AneuRx, Excluder, or Talent endograft. AAA size and endoleak status were recorded from computed tomography (CT) scans at the initial postoperative follow-up visit and at 1 and 2 years thereafter. AAA size was defined as the minor axis of the infrarenal aorta on the largest axial section on the two-dimensional CT scan. A change in AAA size of 0.5 cm or greater from baseline was considered clinically significant. The effect of initial size, endoleak, and type of endograft on AAA regression was analyzed.\nMean baseline size was significantly greater with Talent endografts and smaller with Excluder endografts. Clinically significant regression in AAA size occurred in nearly three fourths of patients with Ancure and Talent endografts at 2 years. Regression in AAA size was less frequent with the AneuRx (46%) and Excluder (44%) devices. Initial size, endoleak, and endograft type were significant predictors of regression at multivariate analysis at 1 year. However, by 2 years only endograft type was still an independent predictor of AAA shrinkage.\nLong-term morphologic changes after endovascular aneurysm repair depend on endograft type.",

    "abstract": "We report results of a pivotal prospective clinical trial that compared standard surgical repair with endovascular exclusion of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with the Talent LPS stent graft system.\nBetween March 24, 1999, and September 19, 2000, 240 patients with AAA who underwent stent graft placement and 126 patients who concurrently underwent surgery to treat AAA were enrolled at 17 centers in the United States. All patients were considered to be at low risk from aortic surgery. Patients who underwent endovascular repair received a bifurcated Talent LPS stent graft; surgical control subjects underwent standard operative techniques. Inclusion criteria were AAA larger than 4.0 cm in diameter, with proximal neck > 5 mm long and 14 to 32 mm in diameter, and a 15 mm landing zone in at least one common iliac artery. Access requirements included one external iliac artery of 7 mm caliber or larger. Preoperative anatomic evaluation included computed tomography and angiography. After stent-graft placement, evaluation involved plain radiography and computed tomography performed before discharge and at 1, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter.\nThere was no significant difference in early (<30 days) or late mortality between the two groups. Complications were slightly higher in the surgical cohort. The stent graft group did better in terms of procedure duration, requirement for general anesthesia and blood transfusion, and intensive care unit and hospital stay. There were three access or deployment failures. Immediate surgical conversion was necessary in only 1 patient, and late conversion in 5 additional patients. There were no aneurysm ruptures. Endoleak rate detected at CT (core laboratory validated) was 14% at 1 month, 12% at 6 months, and 10% at 12 months.\nCompared with surgical control subjects, patients with AAA treated with the Talent LPS stent graft had fewer complications and the same low operative mortality. Likewise, endovascular repair performed better than surgery in the perioperative period, as measured with several key procedural indicators. Long-term follow-up of patients with the stent graft will be essential to assess durability of these early results.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making in regard to elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) requires careful assessment of factors that influence rupture risk, operative mortality, and life expectancy. Individualized consideration of these factors in each patient is essential, and the role of patient preference is of increasing importance. It is not possible or appropriate to recommend a single threshold diameter for intervention which can be generalized to all patients. Based upon the best available current evidence, 5.5 cm is the best threshold for repair in an \"average\" patient. However, subsets of younger, good-risk patients or aneurysms at higher rupture risk may be identified in whom repair at smaller sizes is justified. Conversely, delay in repair until larger diameter may be best for older, higher-risk patients, especially if endovascular repair is not possible. Intervention at diameter <5.5 cm appears indicated in women with AAA. If a patient has suitable anatomy, endovascular repair may be considered, and it is most advantageous for older, higher-risk patients or patients with a hostile abdomen or other technical factors that may complicate standard open repair. With endovascular repair, perioperative morbidity and recovery time are clearly reduced; however, there is a higher reintervention rate, increased surveillance burden, and a small but ongoing risk of AAA rupture. There is no justification at present for different indications for endovascular repair, such as earlier treatment of smaller AAA. Until long-term outcome of endoluminal repair is better defined and results of randomized trials available, the choice between endovascular and open repair will continue to rely heavily on patient preference.",

    "abstract": "Genitourinary anomalies can present a formidable challenge to the vascular surgeon at abdominal aortic reconstruction. We saw a case of crossed renal ectopia without fusion, a rare anomaly, associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm. Because of risk for injury to the kidney during surgery, preoperative evaluation of this anomaly must include computed tomography, angiography, and intravenous pyelography. Preoperative placement of a ureteral catheter may prevent injury to the anomalous ureter. Renal failure of the ectopic kidney during aortic reconstruction can be a serious problem. We used in situ hypothermic perfusion with cold (4 degrees C) Ringer solution for renal protection, and reimplanted the aberrant renal artery. The postoperative course was good, without major complications. The procedure for renal preservation must be selected on the basis of anatomic findings. We review the literature and present the first case of crossed renal ectopia.",

    "abstract": "Takayasu aortitis (TA) is a chronic inflammatory disease predominantly seen in young Asian women. The disease is idiopathic and largely affects the aorta and its major branches. The basic pathologic changes in TA are fibrosis and subsequent occlusion of the large arteries. TA is classically termed \"pulseless\" disease, with manifestations during the occlusive stage including limb ischemia, renovascular hypertension, and heart failure. Arterial dilation and aneurysm are largely unappreciated manifestations of TA, but they occur in as many as 32% of affected patients. We report chronic \"burned out\" TA in a 23-year-old Hispanic woman with isolated aneurysms of the descending thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta, and common iliac arteries, without occlusive disease.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular device-centered infections are a major cause of hospital morbidity, mortality, and expense. Caused by opportunistic bacteria, this phenomenon is thought to arise because of a defect in neutrophil bacterial killing. We have shown that neutrophils that adhere to polystyrene remain viable, whereas neutrophils that adhere to the vascular biomaterials expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) and Dacron undergo a rapid nonapoptotic death. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that surface topography is a determinant of the nonapoptotic death response of neutrophils to biomaterials.\nWe took advantage of the ease with which a polystyrene surface can be manipulated to examine the effect of surface topography on neutrophil viability. Neutrophils were exposed to smooth or roughened polystyrene surfaces both in vivo and in vitro. Changes in cell membrane permeability and production of reactive oxygen species by individual cells were monitored with fluorescent dyes.\nHost cells and isolated human neutrophils died rapidly after adhesion to roughened polystyrene. Neutrophils adherent to roughened surfaces produced more reactive oxygen intermediates than those adherent to smooth surfaces and were first to die. The cell death response precipitated by expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, Dacron, or the roughened surfaces was significantly reduced with treatment of the neutrophils with catalase, diphenylene iodonium, or the src kinase inhibitor PP2 before adhesion.\nNeutrophil adhesion to roughened materials triggers rapid production of reactive oxygen species and precipitates a nonapoptotic cell death. Understanding the material properties that trigger these responses is essential to development of the next generation of implantable biomaterials.",

    "abstract": "R136K is a mutation of fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) in which arginine replaces lysine at the primary thrombin cleavage site. This may be important in vivo in inducing endothelial cell (EC) migration and coverage of arterial injury sites by allowing R136K to be used in a fibrin glue delivery system, without thrombin-induced degradation, in the absence of heparin. The objectives of this study were to determine whether R136K, with and without heparin, can induce migration of EC and smooth muscle cells (SMC) through fibrin glue, and to compare these results with those of wild-type FGF-1; and to determine the resistance of R136K to thrombin-induced degradation versus FGF-1.\nThe dose-response migration through fibrin glue induced by wild-type FGF-1 and the R136K mutant in the presence and absence of heparin was tested with EC and SMC. Migration was tested with 50, 100, and 200 ng/mL of both FGF-1 and R136K, either with or without 5 U/mL of heparin. Migration of EC was also assessed after growth inhibition with mitomycin C. A novel modified Boyden chamber-type migration assay using fibrin glue on the upper surface of the chamber filter was used to test migration. The fluorescent marker calcein was used to identify those cells that had migrated through the fibrin glue and were embedded in the filter. Molecular degradation by thrombin was assessed with sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\nFor EC, R136K in the absence of heparin induced significantly more migration than did FGF-1 at 50 (P <.002), 100 (P <.0001), and 200 (P <.0001) ng/mL. In the presence of heparin, a chemotactic response of EC to cytokine was seen at all doses, with no significant difference between FGF-1 and R136K. A dose-dependent difference was noted in this group between the 100 and 200 ng/mL concentrations of cytokine (for FGF-1, P <.0001; for R136K, P <.0001). SMC showed no difference in migration with FGF-1, R136K, or negative control at any dose in the presence or absence of heparin. Gel electrophoresis demonstrated that R136K was more resistant to thrombin degradation than was FGF-1.\nSite-directed mutagenesis of FGF-1 to R136K enables induction of heparin-independent migration of EC through fibrin glue at an optimal concentration of 100 ng/mL. Neither FGF-1 nor R136K elicits SMC migration through fibrin glue. The ability of R136K to induce EC migration through fibrin glue in the absence of heparin may prove useful in vivo by inducing EC migration and coverage of arterial injury sites, thus potentially reducing thrombogenicity and intimal hyperplasia.",

We modified blood flow to evaluate the effects of wall shear stress (WSS) and relative wall strain (RWS) on aneurysm structure and cellularity.\nRodent AAAs were created with porcine pancreatic elastase infusion. In group 1 AAA WSS was increased with left femoral arteriovenous fistula creation, whereas in group 2 AAA WSS was decreased with left iliac artery ligation. Aortic flow, wall motion, and blood pressure were recorded in both groups. AAA diameter, endothelial and smooth muscle cellularity (CD31 and alpha-smooth muscle actin immunostaining), markers for cell proliferation (5-bromodeoxyuridine), endothelial and smooth muscle cell growth factor production (vascular endothelial growth factor-D and platelet-derived growth factor-beta, respectively), and apoptosis (deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeled [TUNEL] stain) were compared between groups when the animals were killed.\nArteriovenous fistula creation increased WSS (high-flow AAA) by 300% and RWS by 150%. Iliac ligation reduced WSS (low-flow AAA) by 60%. Neither procedure significantly altered systolic, diastolic, or mean aortic pressure. When the animals were killed 7 days after elastase infusion, low-flow AAAs were significantly larger than high-flow AAAs. High-flow AAAs also contained more endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, and evidence of increased growth factor production, cell proliferation, and decreased apoptosis. No difference in type or severity of AAA inflammatory cell infiltrate was noted between groups.\nHigh flow conditions stimulate endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell proliferation in experimental aneurysms. Enhanced cellularity may stabilize aortic integrity, limiting aneurysm growth. Increased lower extremity activity may prevent or retard AAA disease through salutary effects on aortic remodeling mediated by endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells.",

    "abstract": "This investigation was undertaken to determine whether intrinsic or regional factors at different anatomic sites of the aorta affect expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs).\nAortas from Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 22) were divided into arch, descending thoracic, and infrarenal abdominal segments. Specimens were stimulated with interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) (2 ng/mL) for 72 hours. In separate experiments, syngeneic aortic segments were transplanted from the thoracic or abdominal aortas of donor rats into the infrarenal aortic position of recipient rats (n = 12 each). At 4 weeks, aortas from rats who had received transplants were harvested, sectioned into arch, thoracic, and transplanted thoracic or transplanted abdominal segments, and stimulated with IL-1beta. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, zymography, and reverse zymography were performed to assess MMP-9, MMP-2, and TIMP-1 in all aortic segments. Differences were assessed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc Tukey test.\nIn control rats, abdominal segments had significantly higher MMP-9 expression compared with arch and thoracic segments (P <.002). Total MMP-9 activity was also higher in abdominal segments (P <.02). In rats who received transplants, transplanted thoracic (P <.004) and transplanted abdominal (P <.05) segments demonstrated upregulation of MMP-9 expression, compared with control arch and thoracic segments. Zymography documented increased total MMP-9 activity in transplanted thoracic (P <.03) and transplanted abdominal (P <.04) segments versus arch and thoracic segments. No significant difference in MMP-9 expression was found between control abdominal, transplanted thoracic, or transplanted abdominal segments. No significant differences in MMP-2 or TIMP-1 expression or activity were demonstrated in either control or transplanted segments.\nThese data demonstrate that variations in aortic MMP-9 expression and activity result from regional factors affecting the aorta rather than intrinsic aortic wall differences. Increases in abdominal aortic MMP-9 may contribute to the predilection for aneurysm to develop in the infrarenal aorta.",

Angiographic studies showed occlusion or stricture of the central venous tract and venous outflow compromise. All patients had multiple temporary and long-term vascular access sites for hemodialysis, which were revised several times. Venous decompression was performed with a bridge to the ipsilateral femoral vein. A 6 mm reinforced polytetrafluoroethylene graft was tunneled subcutaneously along the thoracoabdominal wall. Patients were released 48 hours after the procedure, and periodic follow-up was carried out to detect changes in graft patency and function.\nThere were no preoperative or intraoperative complications. Clear improvement in signs and symptoms of venous hypertension were observed. Venous pressures decreased. Average follow-up was 16.3 months.

In this cohort study of patients undergoing hemodialysis and receiving a new synthetic vascular graft, detailed intraoperative procedural data were examined as predictors of graft dysfunction and failure.\nA prospective cohort study of patients receiving hemodialysis who had undergone synthetic (polytetrafluoroethylene) graft placement over 4(1/2) years were followed up until either the graft was no longer usable, kidney transplantation was performed, the patient died, or the study ended. The principal methods of analysis used were the Kaplan-Meier method, to compute survival function for primary and secondary graft patency, and Cox proportional hazards regression, to model associations between predictor variables and graft failure.\nOf 284 patients enrolled in the study, 172 patients (61%) had at least one graft-related event, ie, temporary graft dysfunction or graft failure, during follow-up. Three-year cumulative graft survival was 54% (95% confidence interval, 45%-62%). Using proportional hazards analysis, history of claudication (rate ratio [RR], 2.14 [range, 0.97-4.73]; P =.06), number of previous permanent grafts (1 graft: RR, 1.49 [range, 0.88-2.51]; 2 or more grafts: RR, 2.85 [range, 1.43-5.69]; P =.01), dialysis dependency at surgery (RR, 2.96 [range, 1.23-7.12]; P =.02), and use of arterial clamps in construction of the graft (RR, 2.32 [range, 1.14-4.73]; P =.02) were associated with lower survival, even after accounting for medical history.

    "abstract": "Conventional end-to-side anastomosis to establish venous outflow for prosthetic arteriovenous grafts often requires operative patch angioplasty within 1 year because of venous stenosis. Rather than conventional venous anastomosis, a modified end-to-side anastomosis at a 15-degree angle with a flow diffuser was constructed. Such diffusers allow decreased flow velocity and increased pressure, inhibiting boundary layer separation.\nTen brachial artery to axillary vein 6 mm straight se-polytetrafluoroethylene prosthetic arteriovenous grafts were created with this technique. Patients included 6 men and 4 women (mean age, 66.4 years; range, 54-80 years), all with renal failure and a history of diabetes. The degree of stenosis at the venous anastomosis was determined with duplex scanning at intervals of 6 months. Analysis of survival and cumulative primary patency estimates were determined with the Kaplan-Meier method.\nPrimary cumulative patency estimate of 100% for the modified group at 18 and 24 months was significantly greater than that for age-matched historic control fistulas with the conventional end-to-side anastomosis (n = 20): 18 months, 32%; 24 months, 32% (P <.05). Although venous stenosis could not be quantitated for thrombosed conventional fistulas, modified anastomoses had minimal stenosis at 24 months: mean area reduction, 30% (range, 20%-45%).\nIncorporation of a flow diffuser and a 15-degree anastomotic angle significantly increases patency of prosthetic brachial artery to axillary vein grafts.",

C pneumoniae antibodies were measured with a microimmunofluorescence test.\nC pneumoniae DNA in atherosclerotic carotid plaques was detected in 44.4% of patients with symptomatic disease and in 30.3% of those with asymptomatic disease (P =.48). C pneumoniae DNA in lymph nodes was detected in 33.3% of patients with symptomatic disease and 18.2% of those with asymptomatic disease (P =.19). Prevalence of C pneumoniae DNA in PBMCs was significantly higher in patients with symptomatic disease (72.2%) compared with those with asymptomatic disease (30.3%) (P =.01). Serologic results support the association between C pneumoniae DNA in PBMCs and symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease, because seropositivity for anti-chlamydial immunoglobulin (Ig) A antibodies was significantly higher in PCR-positive PBMCs in patients with symptomatic disease compared with patients with asymptomatic disease (P =.02).\nDetection of C pneumoniae in PBMCs shows that C pneumoniae may be associated with symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease. Although we believe there is need for standardization of PCR methods and for assessing sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the tests, we suggest that presence of C pneumoniae DNA in PBMCs is a valid surrogate marker of risk for endovascular chlamydial infection. Only long-term cohort studies and interventional trials will clarify the etiopathogenic role of C pneumoniae.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to review the long-term results of catheter-directed thrombolysis in treatment of infrainguinal bypass graft occlusion.\nFrom January 1987 to December 1998, 67 patients with 69 acutely occluded infrainguinal arterial bypass grafts (48 vein grafts, 21 prosthetic grafts) underwent treatment with catheter-directed thrombolysis with urokinase. Long-term results were assessed with Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis, and factors predictive of success were determined with multivariate analysis.\nThrombolysis was aborted in 7 patients (10%) because of major complications or technical failure and was unsuccessful in restoring graft patency (</=90% lysis) in 13 patients (19%). Successful lysis was achieved in 49 patients (71%). A causative lesion was identified and treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) or limited operative revision in 33 patients. Diffuse vein graft intimal hyperplasia or poor runoff was identified in the remaining 9 patients, who were offered no further intervention. Cumulative patency at 60 months was 65% +/- 8% for successfully lysed vein grafts; however, only 3 of 16 successfully lysed prosthetic grafts were patent at 9 months. Although univariate analysis identified several factors associated with successful long-term vein graft function, only white race was significant at multivariate regression analysis.\nCoupled with identification and aggressive treatment of underlying causative lesions, catheter-directed thrombolysis can salvage many thrombosed vein grafts, with expectation of long-term patency similar to that with repeat bypass grafting. Poor short-term results of thrombolysis of occluded prosthetic grafts support repeat operation with a completely new bypass graft as a more appropriate option.",

All five had arterial hypertension. The diagnosis of inflammatory aneurysm was made on the basis of clinical suspicion supported by characteristic features on CT scans. Endoaneurysmorraphy was performed in all cases; a tube graft was inserted in three cases, and bifurcation was performed in 2. The macroscopic appearance of periaortic fibrosis was detected at the infrarrenal portion of the aneurysm in the 5 patients, but no retroperitoneal fibrosis was found at the level of the distal thoracic aorta in any case.\nThere was no operative mortality. Paraparesis was not detected in any patient. One patient had acute kidney failure, and another required an extended stay in the intensive care unit because of respiratory insufficiency. Pathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of inflammatory aneurysm in all 5 patients, with characteristic adventitial thickening caused by lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and fibrosis around the ganglionic and nerve structures.\nType IV thoracoabdominal aneurysm with inflammatory changes can be treated at surgery with a retroperitoneal approach.

    "abstract": "Cytokines are the primary mediators of inflammation and also influence matrix metalloproteinase expression, both of which are important in development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). A significant, but as yet unknown, familial factor contributes to the pathogenesis of AAA. Many cytokine genes contain polymorphic sites, some of which affect cytokine production in vitro. Cytokine gene polymorphisms may therefore influence the pathogenesis of AAA. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is any association between cytokine gene polymorphisms and AAA.\nThis case-control study comprised 100 patients with AAA and 100 age-matched and sex-matched control subjects. For each case and control subject in the study, genotypes at the following cytokine gene polymorphic loci were determined: interleukin (IL)-1beta +3953, IL-6 -174, IL-10 -1082, IL-10 -592, and tumor necrosis factors-alpha -308. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between AAA and control groups, and odds ratios (OR) were calculated for the presence of AAA with each allele at each locus examined as risk factors. The IL-10 -1082 A allele was significantly more common in the AAA group than the control group (P =.03). The OR for the IL-10 -1082 A allele as a risk factor for AAA was 1.8 (95% confidence interval, 0.9-3.6).\nThese associations suggest a significant role for IL-10 in the pathogenesis of AAA. This association of AAA with the IL-10 -1082 A allele is also biologically plausible; the IL-10 -1082 A allele is associated with low IL-10 secretion, and it may be that AAA develops in patients who are unable to mount the same anti-inflammatory response as those who do not have AAA.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms, while advantageous because of its minimally invasive nature, falls short of achieving the long-term durability of traditional open surgical repair. Problems such as device migration, continued sac pressurization from endoleak, and graft limb thrombosis culminate in a high rate of secondary procedures and failure to protect against aneurysm rupture. While prior studies hint at a correlation between these postprocedural events and specific device design, a single comparative analysis that correlates device attributes with clinical outcome has not been performed.\nOver 6 years ending in 2002, 703 patients underwent endovascular treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms. During this time, five devices were used, ie, Ancure, AneuRx, Excluder, Talent, and Zenith, and six device-specific groups were analyzed; the Zenith group was subdivided into those placed as part of the multicenter trial (Zenith-MCT) and those under a sponsor-investigator investigational device exemption trial (Zenith-SIT). Results were assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method for censored data, and the log-rank test was used to ascertain differences between device groups.\nWhile overall survival was diminished in the Zenith-SIT group (P =.046), risk for aneurysm-related death was similar in all groups (P =.336), averaging 2% or less at 12 months. Among the total cohort of patients, freedom from rupture was 98.7% +/- 0.9% at 24 months, without demonstrable differences between groups (P =.533). There were no statistically significant differences in rate of secondary procedures, conversion to open repair, or migration. There were, however, significant differences in risk for graft limb occlusion and rate of endoleak between groups. Limb occlusion occurred most often with Ancure devices (11% +/- 4.6% at 12 months, P =.009). Endoleak of any type was most common with Excluder devices (64% +/- 11% at 12 months, P =.003), a finding directly related to increased frequency of type II leaks in that group (58% +/- 11% at 12 months, P =.001). While there were no differences in frequency of type I or type III endoleak, a trend toward increased risk for microleak was observed with AneuRx devices (4.0% +/- 1.3%, P =.054), and more modular separations were observed with Zenith devices (3.5% +/- 2.3%, P =.032). Shrinkage at 12 months correlated with frequency of endoleak in the device groups, and was most common in the two Zenith groups (54% +/- 7.3% in the Zenith-MCT group and 56% +/- 7.8% in the Zenith-SIT group) and the Talent group (52% +/- 9.7%) and was least in the Excluder group (15% +/- 7.9% at 12 months, P <.001). By contrast, sac growth occurred most often in the Zenith-SIT group (13% +/- 4.5% at 12 months, P =.034), possibly as a result of the challenging aortoiliac anatomy frequently present in these patients.\nThere are significant differences in frequency of limb occlusion and endoleak between groups with different endovascular devices. Knowledge of these and other differences is instructional in development of next-generation endovascular devices, incorporating design features linked to satisfactory outcome while abandoning those associated with device failure.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular placement of prosthetic valves is currently in clinical trials as treatment for lower extremity venous hypertension caused by valvular insufficiency. Femoropopliteal vein sizing is a critical factor in treatment planning. A wide diameter range could influence selection of an endoprosthesis. Quantitative data describing intrasubject vein diameter variation are scant. We measured vein diameters with ultrasound imaging to assess minimum-maximum diameter range under forced conditions of venoconstriction and venodilatation.\nDiameter of the common femoral vein (CFV), proximal femoral vein (PFV), mid-femoral vein (MFV), and distal femoral vein (DFV) in the thigh and the popliteal vein (PV) was measured in the morning under conditions of minimal venodilation and in the afternoon under conditions of stressed venodilatation that included activities of daily living and a 5-minute treadmill walk. Measurements were obtained twice on two different days in both extremities in 20 subjects with CEAP clinical classification C(0) (n = 10), C(3) (n = 7), C(4) (n = 1), or C(5) (n = 2).\nAverage vein diameter increased, from 11.2 +/- 2.5 (SD) mm to 14.5 +/- 2.3 mm at the CFV, from 6.9 +/- 1.8 mm to 9.4 +/- 1.9 mm at the PFV, from 6.9 +/- 1.6 mm to 9.0 +/- 1.8 mm at the MFV, from 7.3 +/- 1.7 mm to 9.1 +/- 1.5 mm at the DFV, and from 8.4 +/- 1.4 mm to 9.7 +/- 1.8 mm at the PV (P <.001 for all differences). Maximum diameter change was 8.2 mm at the CFV, 7.0 mm at the PFV, 6.6 mm at the MFV, 6.0 mm at the DFV, and 5.1 mm at the PV. Dilatation of 4 mm or greater occurred in 43% of CFV, 15% of PFV, 11% of MFV, 3% of DFV, and 1% of PV. Minimum vein diameter was found at PFV in 41%, MFV in 34%, and DFV in 23% of morning measurements and at PFV in 21%, MFV in 38%, DFV in 28%, and PV in 16% of afternoon measurements.\nFemoropopliteal veins demonstrated a wide range of diameters, and significant diameter changes were detected in all vein segments. Variations in vein diameter must be evaluated in candidates for endovascular venous valve prostheses. Such devices must adapt to a wide range in vein diameter.",

    "abstract": "The role of prophylactic vena cava filters (VCF) in patients with cancer is debated. Although VCF are often placed in patients with cancer after recurrence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE), identification of this subset of patients has not been well-defined. This study was undertaken to assess factors associated with increased risk for recurrent VTE.\nAll patients with a history of thromboembolism or malignant disease and who required a VCF because of failure of or contraindication to anticoagulation therapy were abstracted from the Michigan Filter Registry. Univariate analysis of potential risk factors for recurrent VTE and logistic regression models were used to identify associations between these variables and recurrent VTE.\nNinety-nine patients (49 men, 50 women) with a mean age of 58 years were included in the study. New metastases occurred in 55% of patients, and 12% of patients had a history of VTE before cancer diagnosis. Corticosteroid agents were used during therapy in 48% of patients. Acute VTE was present in 52% of patients at cancer diagnosis, and in 34% of patients VTE was associated with new metastases. Recurrent VTE occurred in 40% of patients, and significant risk factors included presence of new metastases (odds ratio [OR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-9.09; P =.02) and history of VTE (OR, 10.6; CI, 1.98-57.2; P =.006). Whereas a single episode of neutropenia did not reach significance (OR, 1.1; CI, 0.97-1.35; P =.11), multiple neutropenic episodes were significantly associated with recurrent VTE (P =.04). Smoking, hormone replacement therapy, decreased mobility, post-surgical state, and obesity were not independently associated with increased risk. Mean survival in this series was 30 months, and was significantly worse in patients with VTE at cancer diagnosis and with inability to tolerate anticoagulant therapy in conjunction with VCF.\nPatients with malignant disease may be at increased risk for recurrent VTE after development of new metastases or multiple episodes of neutropenia, especially those patients with a history of VTE. VCF may be a reasonable alternative to long-term anticoagulation therapy in this subgroup of patients at high risk patients, provided their quality of life is reasonable.",

    "abstract": "Aorto-bifemoral bypass (AFB) is commonly performed in US hospitals. Durable long-term outcome is achieved after AFB performed to treat aortoiliac occlusive disease. However, short-term outcome for complex surgical procedures is not uniform across medical centers. The objective of the current study was to define the relationship of hospital volume to operative mortality after AFB.\nThe study included 3073 patients with a primary procedure code for AFB and a diagnostic code for peripheral vascular occlusive disease who received treatment during 1997 at 483 hospitals in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). The NIS represents a 20% stratified random sample representative of all US hospitals. Unadjusted and case mix-adjusted analyses were performed.\nOverall AFB-related mortality was 3.3%. Hospitals that performed more than 25 AFB per year (33% of patients at 37 hospitals in the NIS) had a lower crude mortality rate (3.7% vs 2.2%) compared with hospitals that performed fewer AFB. In a multivariate analysis adjusting for case mix, AFB at a high- volume hospital was associated with 42% decreased risk for in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34-0.97; P =.04) compared with low-volume hospitals. Two other important risk factors associated with increased mortality in the multivariate analysis included age more than 65 years (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.0-5.4) and history of chronic pulmonary disease (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-2.9).\nAFB operative mortality was significantly lower at high-volume hospitals in this nationally representative database. The effect of hospital volume of AFB procedures on outcome should be of importance to patients, providers, and health policy makers.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the utility of color duplex ultrasound (CDU)-derived common femoral artery (CFA) hemodynamics for detecting significant aortoiliac occlusive disease and predicting its severity.\nFrom January 1997 to June 2001, 132 consecutive patients with lower extremity arterial insufficiency underwent both femoropopliteal CDU scanning and aortography with runoff studies. CDU-derived CFA waveform contour (monophasic, biphasic, or triphasic), peak systolic velocity (PSV), and acceleration time were recorded for each patient. Severity of aortoiliac occlusive disease was classified by arteriography into three distinct groups: normal or minimal disease (<50%, group 1), significant focal or diffuse stenoses (>/=50%, group 2), or total occlusion (group 3). Using probability and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, waveform contour and PSV were compared alone and in combination with the arteriographic groups to identify waveform contours and threshold PSV, which may accurately differentiate the three categories of aortoiliac occlusive disease.\nOf 214 limbs available for study, 112 composed group 1, 70 composed group 2, and 32 composed group 3.

    "abstract": "Popliteal artery aneurysms (PAA) are frequently treated with ligation and exclusion bypass grafting. It is assumed that these aneurysms will shrink and remain asymptomatic. This may not always be true. We sought to elucidate the fate of excluded PAA over time.\nData for all PAAs treated with ligation and exclusion bypass grafting between 1986 and 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. Computed tomography (CT) scans and duplex ultrasound scans provided aneurysm patency data and maximal transverse diameter measurements of the popliteal artery during late postoperative follow-up. This information was compared with that from similar preoperative studies.\nForty-one patients (39 men, 2 women) underwent 57 ligation and exclusion bypass grafting procedures. Both preoperative and late postoperative (mean, 4.0 years; range, 0.43-13.5 years) CT scans or duplex ultrasound scans were available for review of 25 PAAs in 18 patients (ages 42-80 years; mean, 63 years). Preoperative PAA size ranged from 14 to 45 mm (mean, 28.7 mm). In late follow-up, 12 (48%) PAA had decreased in size (mean, 7.3 mm), 5 (20%) remained unchanged, and 8 (32%) increased in mean transverse diameter (mean, 5.9 mm). One large aneurysm increased by 50%. Contrast material enhancement was identified in the excluded sac in 11 aneurysms.\nPAA treated with ligation and exclusion bypass grafting often expand and can become symptomatic. This may be analogous to type II endoleak or endotension noted after aortic endovascular repair. We recommend PAA excision or endoaneurysmorrhaphy when feasible.",

    "abstract": "Internal iliac artery (IIA) coil embolization as an adjunct to endovascular stent grafting (ESG) is common practice for treating abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in patients with a substantially enlarged common iliac artery requiring extension of the stent-graft limb into the external iliac artery. The literature describing pelvic ischemia in association with IIA coil embolization contains conflicting reports of symptom severity. We studied IIA occlusion outcome as a function of coil placement in the IIA.\nFrom August 1997 to March 2002, 20 patients with AAA underwent ESG with unilateral IIA coil embolization. Coils were placed proximal to the first branch of the IIA in 8 patients and distal to the first branch in 12 patients. Symptoms of pelvic ischemia and mid-term outcome were studied.\nPatients included 18 men and 2 women with mean age of 70(1/2) years (range, 53-86 years). Mean diameter of AAA was 54.4 mm (range, 38-80 mm), and of common iliac artery was 24.2 mm (range, 15-48 mm). Ten patients (50%) had new onset of symptoms of pelvic ischemia after endograft procedures: 1 of 8 patients (13%) with proximal IIA embolization had buttock claudication, and 9 of 12 patients (75%) with distal IIA embolization had pelvic ischemic symptoms, including buttock claudication in 8 and impotence in 1 (P =.02, Fisher exact test). No colonic ischemia occurred in this series. At 12-month follow-up, 4 patients with distal IIA embolization were symptom-free. At further follow-up to 24 months, 4 patients remained significantly limited with symptoms of claudication.\nA significantly higher incidence of symptoms of pelvic ischemia occurred with more distal placement of coils for IIA embolization. Failure to control for extent of coil placement may account for the apparently conflicting results in published studies. IIA coil embolization should be performed as proximal as possible to prevent interference with pelvic collateral circulation.",

Follow-up evaluation included clinical examination, laboratory evaluation of serum creatine concentration, computed tomographic angiography, and renal duplex scanning.\nThirty-seven patients underwent transrenal fixation of aortic stent-grafts as part of a Phase II US Food and Drug Administration study. Two patients subsequently underwent follow-up at institutions closer to their homes, and thus provided clinical information but no long-term renal or aneurysm morphologic data. There were no perioperative deaths. Five patients died during follow-up, at a mean of 9 months, because of myocardial infarction in 4 patients and respiratory failure in 1 patient. Thirty patients, ages 75 +/- 8 years, have been followed up for 28.5 +/- 7.2 months. Aneurysm diameter at follow-up was 5.0 +/- 0.8 cm, compared with 5.7 +/- 0.8 cm preoperatively. In 5 patients, endoleak developed during follow-up: 1 type I leak was treated with an aortic cuff, with temporary stabilization of the aneurysm and correction of the endoleak; 2 type II endoleaks were treated with translumbar coil embolization, and 1 resolved spontaneously; and 1 type III endoleak was treated with a combination of coil embolization and stent-graft extension to cover a graft defect. Preoperatively, serum creatinine concentration was normal in 23 patients, but increased persistently in 2 patients and was abnormal in 7 patients. Postoperatively, creatine concentration increased in 4 patients to greater than 20% of baseline level. Seventeen patients had no evidence of renal artery stenosis, compared with 13 patients with renal artery stenosis. Of 41 normal renal arteries, 90% remained unchanged, 1 became occluded, 3 demonstrated 60% stenosis. Nephrectomy was necessary in 1 patient because of cancer. Of 19 abnormal renal arteries, progression of disease was noted in 3 arteries.\nTransrenal fixation of aortic stent-grafts can be performed with acceptable mid-term outcome with respect to mortality, need for follow-up intervention, and aneurysm exclusion with protection from rupture. Postprocedural stenosis can develop in both normal and abnormal renal arteries. Rate of progression of disease was greater in patients with preprocedural renal dysfunction compared with patients with normal renal arteries. This is merely an observation, and may not be related to transrenal fixation. Long-term follow up is needed.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular stent grafting offers a potentially less invasive option for treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Clinical benefit has been demonstrated with respect to early parameters such as blood transfusion, return of gastrointestinal function, and length of hospital stay. Endovascular repair, however, has been criticized on the basis of inferior long-term outcome. Secondary procedures may be necessary to address durability issues such as migration, high-pressure endoleak, graft limb thrombosis, and degeneration of the stent-fabric structure itself, issues that may compromise the primary goal of aneurysm repair, protection from rupture.\nBetween 1996 and 2002, 703 patients underwent endovascular treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm at The Cleveland Clinic Foundation. During this time, five devices were used: Ancure, AneuRx, Excluder, Talent, and Zenith. Outcome was assessed with physical examination, lower extremity arterial studies, plain abdominal radiography, and computed tomography at discharge, at 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, and annually thereafter. Secondary procedures were defined as any procedure, exclusive of diagnostic angiography, performed after stent graft implantation, directed at treatment of aneurysm-related events. Multivariable statistical techniques for censored data (Cox proportional hazards modeling) were used to determine baseline parameters associated with need for secondary procedures over follow-up, with calculation of hazards ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).\nPatient follow-up averaged 12.2 +/- 11.7 months. Patient survival was 90% +/- 1.4% at 1 year, 78% +/- 2.6% at 2 years, and 70% +/- 3.8% at 3 years. Aneurysm rupture occurred in 3 patients (0.4%), accounting for rupture risk of 1.4% over the first 2 years of follow-up (Kaplan-Meier method). Overall, 128 secondary procedures were required in 104 patients (15%), with a cumulative risk of 12% +/- 1.5% at 1 year, 24% +/- 2.8% at 2 years, and 35% +/- 4.4% at 3 years after stent graft implantation. Among the secondary procedures, new stent grafts and extensions were placed in 34 patients (27%), embolization of endoleak was performed in 33 patients (26%), and open surgical conversion was undertaken in 11 patients (9%). Periprocedural mortality of secondary procedures was 8% overall, but was 18% for patients undergoing open surgical conversion. Multivariable modeling identified the date the procedure was performed (HR, 1.53 per 3-month period of study; CI, 1.22-1.92; P <.001) and aneurysm size (HR, 1.35 per centimeter of minor axis; CI, 1.13-1.60; P <.001) as independent predictors of need for secondary procedures.\nCurrent endovascular devices are associated with a relatively high rate of complications over mid-term follow-up, culminating in frequent need for secondary remedial procedures. With strict follow-up imaging compliance, however, risk for rupture and aneurysm-related death remain exceedingly low. Newer technology may achieve improved durability and a lower requirement for secondary procedures, while maintaining the minimally invasive nature of presently available devices.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of Medicare prospective payment systems, health care entities and physicians were forced to decrease expenses by sharing services and to increase revenue by attempting to jointly negotiate better reimbursement from third- party payers. Both activities have raised the specter of prosecution under antitrust laws that have been with us for more than a century but are poorly understood by practicing physicians. Recent monopolistic activities in the health care arena have prompted the Federal Trade Commission to file actions under specific acts of Congress, eg, the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, Clayton Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, Robinson-Patman Act, and Celler-Kefauver Act. Inasmuch as it is likely that specialties such as vascular surgery as a business will undergo substantial transformation, physicians need to be aware of the severe civil and criminal sanctions imposed if they are found guilty; fines that are several times actual damages; activities that raise antitrust issues including utilization review, medical staff privileges for competing specialties, participating provider agreements, and predatory pricing; and affirmative defenses and relief available in terms of specific exemptions. As health care providers react, innovate, and adjust to stay solvent, their business strategies will surely continue to be scrutinized for antitrust behavior by federal and state officials. The physician must have a basic understanding of the groundrules that govern any contemplated business strategy so that common pitfalls may be averted.",

    "abstract": "Paraplegia is rare after open repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, and only two cases have been reported after endovascular repair, both due to atheroembolism. Incidence of renal failure after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR) in patients with normal preoperative renal function is about 8.7%, but is much higher in those with preexisting renal impairment, possibly because of administration of nephrotoxic contrast media during EVAR. We report a case in which contrast medium-induced acute renal failure is believed to have led to delayed paraplegia after EVAR.",

    "abstract": "A young, otherwise healthy man had chronic cough of 16 months' duration. Evaluation revealed an aberrant right subclavian artery. Kommerell's diverticulum without aneurysmal degeneration was present. Imaging studies showed compression of the esophagus but not the trachea. Results of methacholine challenge test were negative for evidence of reactive airway disease, but suggested mild variable intrathoracic obstruction. While aberrant right subclavian artery syndrome most commonly involves dysphagia, our patient's only symptom was cough. Right subclavian artery to right common carotid artery transposition was performed, with oversewing of the subclavian artery stump to the left of the esophagus through a right supraclavicular incision. This treatment was curative, with complete resolution of symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Identification of molecular factors involved in artery wall stabilization after extracellular matrix injury elicited by inflammation and proteolysis has a major role in the development of new therapies for atherosclerosis. A study from our group demonstrated that endovascular seeding of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) promotes healing and stabilizes experimental aneurysms by downregulating matrix metalloproteinase and upregulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase and collagen gene expression. We analyzed expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and its receptors in experimental aneurysms treated with endovascular VSMC therapy.\nAneurysms were generated in Fischer 344 rats by 14-day orthotopic implantation of a segment of guinea pig abdominal aorta (xenograft). During an endovascular repeat operation, syngeneic VSMCs were seeded in the aneurysm, always resulting in aneurysm diameter stabilization after 8 weeks, whereas diameter of control aneurysms infused with culture medium further increased. Seven days after repeat operation the intima or thrombus was separated from the aneurysmal wall in the two groups. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction with the domestic gene 18s as a standard demonstrated that aneurysm stabilization was associated with a statistically significant increase in TGF-beta(1), but not TGF-beta(2) or TGF-beta(3), messenger RNA levels in the intima. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated increased TGF-beta(1) protein in the aneurysmal wall. mRNA levels of the two serine and threonine kinase TGF-beta receptors remained unchanged.\nHealing and stabilization of aneurysms with endovascular cell therapy is associated with a specific pattern of gene expression, resulting in paracrine secretion of TGF-beta(1). Our study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms of arterial aneurysm healing and stabilization.",

Experiments were conducted in vitro to demonstrate selective SMC cytotoxicity and in vivo to demonstrate reduced neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) in a clinically relevant animal model.\nIn vitro: Cultured human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (UASMC) and venous endothelial cells (HUVEC) were exposed to varying multiplicities of infection (MOI) of a gamma(1)34.5-deleted HSV-1 virus (R849). Cell survival was assessed at 48 and 72 hours with a colorimetric MTT viability assay. In vivo: New Zealand White rabbit external jugular veins (n = 21) were exposed to R849 (2.5 x 10(6) pfu/mL) or culture medium at 110 to 120 mm Hg for 10 minutes, then fashioned as vein patches on carotid arteries. Carotid arteries were ligated distally to decrease blood flow and stimulate a hyperplastic response (ultra-low shear stress model). After 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks, patched segments were perfusion-fixed with glutaraldehyde and morphometrically examined for NIH formation.\nIn vitro: At 48 hours, R849 exhibited preferential cytotoxicity to UASMC compared with HUVEC, with 11% +/- 10% of UASMCs and 49% +/- 8% of HUVECs surviving after infection with MOI = 25 (P <.05). Higher MOI resulted in poor survival of both cell lines. In vivo: Blood flow was similarly reduced in all animals both at surgery (0.9 +/- 0.1 mL/min vs 1.6 +/- 0.3 mL/min) and at harvest (2.7 +/- 0.4 mL/min vs 2.5 +/- 0.5 mL/min).

    "abstract": "Venous ulcer fibroblasts demonstrate decreased proliferative responses to growth factor stimulation, suggesting cellular senescence. However, the role of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) disease progression and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in agonist-induced cellular proliferation is ill-defined. We hypothesize that CVI-induced fibroblast proliferative resistance to growth factors worsens with disease progression and is regulated by the composition of ECM.\nFibroblast explants were isolated from biopsy specimens from two patients without CVI and 16 patients with CVI of the lower calf (LC) and lower thigh (LT) and stratified according to CEAP disease severity: non-CVI (NC; n = 2), class 2-3 (n = 5), class 4 (n = 5), class 5 (n = 3), and class 6 (n = 3). Proliferation experiments were standardized with a neonatal foreskin fibroblast cell line (HS68). A 10-day course and dose response experiment with 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 ng/mL of transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) demonstrated maximal cell proliferation at 5 ng/mL of TGF-beta(1) on day 4. Under these conditions, CVI dermal fibroblasts were challenged with and without TGF-beta(1) and evaluated for proliferative responses on plates coated with polystyrene, collagen, and fibronectin.\nNo differences in unstimulated proliferation were observed in LT and LC fibroblasts from patients with class 2-3 disease and LT fibroblasts from patients with class 4 and 5 disease, compared with NC and HS68 cells. LC fibroblasts from patients with class 4 disease (P <.05) and class 5 disease (P <.001), and LC (P <.001), and LT fibroblasts from patients with class 6 disease (P <.001) proliferated to a lesser degree than did NC and HS68 cells. The diminished proliferation observed in class 4 LC cells was reversible with TGF-beta(1) stimulation (P <.004); however, class 5 and class 6 LC and LT fibroblasts did not respond to stimulation with TGF-beta(1). Collagen increased proliferation of HS68 cells with (P <.05) and without (P <.01) TGF-beta(1), compared with cells grown on polystyrene, but did not increase proliferative responses in NC or CVI fibroblasts with and without TGF-beta(1). Similarly, fibronectin increased proliferation of HS68 cells (P <.05) compared with cells grown on polystyrene, but did not alter proliferation in CVI fibroblasts. Fibronectin did seem to inhibit TGF-beta(1)-induced proliferation observed in class 4 LC cells.\nThese data indicate that clinical disease progression correlates with cellular dysfunction. Fibroblasts from patients with class 2-3 disease retain their unstimulated and agonist- induced proliferative capacity, compared with NC and HS68 cells. The onset of inflammatory skin changes (class 4 and class 5 disease) diminishes agonist-induced proliferation, and ulcer formation (class 6 disease) severely inhibits it. In addition, the composition of ECM does not affect TGF-beta(1)-induced proliferation of fibroblasts in CVI.",

However, the effects of oscillatory shear stress (SS) on SMC proliferation and signal transduction pathways that control survival are not well described.\nBovine aortic SMC were exposed to arterial levels of oscillatory SS (14 dyne/cm(2)) with an orbital shaker; control cells were exposed to static conditions (0 dyne/cm(2)). Cell number and (3)[H]thymidine incorporation were measured after 1, 3, or 5 days of SS. Activation of the Akt pathway was assessed with the Western blot technique. Specificity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway was determined with the Western blot technique with the inhibitors LY294002 (10 micromol/L) or wortmannin (25 nmol/L).\nArterial levels of oscillatory SS increased SMC cell number by 20.1 +/- 3.7% and (3)[H]thymidine incorporation by 33.4% +/- 6.8% at 5 days. To identify whether SS increased activity of the SMC survival pathway, Akt activation was measured. SMC exposed to SS demonstrated increased Akt phosphorylation compared with control cells, with maximal phosphorylation at 60 minutes. Both PI3K inhibitors specifically inhibited the increase in Akt phosphorylation in SMC exposed to oscillatory SS.\nSMC directly respond to oscillatory SS by increasing DNA synthesis, proliferation, and activation of the PI3K-Akt signal transduction pathway. These results suggest a mechanism of SMC survival and proliferation in response to endothelial-denuding arterial injury.",

    "abstract": "The abdominal aorta (AA) has a predilection for aneurysm formation. An etiologic factor may be underlying aortic wall stress. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the intima-media thickness (IMT) of the AA, as a surrogate to arterial wall thickness, can be measured noninvasively with satisfactory results to calculate circumferential wall stress, and to evaluate regional and gender differences in wall stress.\nSixty-five middle-aged healthy subjects were examined with B-mode ultrasound to determine the diameter and IMT in the infrarenal AA, common carotid artery (CCA), common femoral artery (CFA), and popliteal artery (PA). Blood pressure was measured noninvasively in the brachial artery. Wall stress was calculated according to the law of LaPlace.\nIntraobserver variability for the IMT in the AA showed a coefficient of variation of 11%. IMT was thickest in the AA compared with the CCA, CFA, and PA (P <.001). There was a gender difference in IMT in the CFA (P <.05) and PA (P <.01) but not in the AA. Greater wall stress was found in the AA than in the CCA (P <.001) and PA (P <.001), with men having greater wall stress in all studied arterial regions.\nAortic IMT can be satisfactorily studied in vivo with noninvasive B-mode ultrasound. There are gender differences in IMT and wall stress, and the largest wall stress is found in the AA in men, which might be important in aneurysm development.",

    "abstract": "Reports of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) bypass grafting to the infrapopliteal arteries have often used survival analysis of acceptable quality to describe a wide range of long-term results. In theory, these results may be combined if variability between series and time intervals is considered.\nMeta-analysis was performed to gain insight into long-term graft patency and foot preservation after PTFE bypass grafting to infrapopliteal arteries.\nStudies published from 1982 through 2001 were identified from the PubMed database and pertinent original articles.\nThree investigators selected 43 studies that used survival analysis, reported 2-year patency rates, and included at least 15 bypass procedures. Data extraction and transformation: Based on standard life-tables or survivor curves, an interval success rate was calculated for each month in each series. The monthly success rates were combined across series, enabling construction of pooled survivor curves.\nRandom-effects meta-analysis yielded 5-year pooled estimates (SE) of 30.5% (7.6%) for primary graft patency, 39.7% (5.5%) for secondary graft patency, and 55.7% (5.0%) for foot preservation. During the entire follow-up, pooled estimates were slightly higher for series of PTFE grafts with adjunctive procedures compared with series of PTFE grafts only. Sensitivity analysis: A simulation using only unfavorable assumptions showed a decrease of less than 5% at 5 years for all outcomes, and smaller differences at subgroup meta-analysis. Funnel plots suggested that publication bias was unlikely.\nThis meta-analysis indicated moderate success for PTFE bypass grafts to infrapopliteal arteries, but the role of adjunctive procedures at the distal anastomosis remains uncertain.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of substituting multi-station total outflow contrast medium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) for color duplex ultrasound (US) scanning on treatment planning in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected or known peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Patients and methods One hundred consecutive patients referred because of suspected or proved peripheral arterial occlusive disease to a University Hospital underwent both aortoiliac duplex US scanning and multi-station total outflow CE-MRA. For 73 of these patients (57% men; mean age, 62 years) treatment or treatment plans could be retraced. Eighteen patients also underwent femoro-popliteal duplex US scanning. Three experienced vascular surgeons retrospectively formulated two sets of treatment plans based on standardized clinical parameters and either duplex US scanning or CE-MRA. The main outcome measure was proportion of patients for whom the treatment plan matched actual treatment without additional use of intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography. Actual treatment, based on all available information, including results of duplex US scanning, CE-MRA, and any other diagnostic tests, served as the standard of reference.\nDuplex US scanning provided enough information for treatment planning in 46, 45, and 53 patients versus 67, 68, and 66 patients when CE-MRA was used (surgeons 1, 2, and 3, respectively; surgeons 1 and 2, P <.001; surgeon 3, P =.007). Treatment plans based on duplex US scanning exactly matched actual treatment in 37 of 73 patients (51%; surgeon 1), 36 of 73 patients (49%; surgeon 2), and 46 of 73 patients (63%; surgeon 3). Treatment plans based on CE-MRA exactly matched actual treatment in 56 of 73 patients (77%; surgeon 1), 55 of 73 patients (75%; surgeon 2), and 51 of 73 patients (70%; surgeon 3). Positive predictive value and negative predictive value of duplex US scanning as measures of ability to discriminate between surgical and nonsurgical treatment were 0 of 0 (undefined) and 43 of 46 (93%), 1 of 2 (50%) and 40 of 43 (93%), and 5 of 5 (100%) and 44 of 48 (92%) for surgeons 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

    "abstract": "This is a computational analysis of the effects of external carotid artery (ECA) flow, waveform, and occlusion geometry on two hemodynamic wall parameters associated with intimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis. Study design Transient three-dimensional fluid mechanics analysis was applied to a standard carotid artery bifurcation. Mean internal carotid artery (ICA) flow was maintained at 236 mL/min with a normal waveform. ECA flow was increased from zero to 151 mL/min (64% of ICA flow) with both a normal biphasic waveform and a damped waveform. Geometry of five ECA occlusions was studied: distal, proximal stump, smooth, smooth without carotid sinus, and optimal reconstruction.Primary outcome measures Two time-averaged and area-averaged hemodynamic wall parameters were computed from the velocity and wall shear stress (WSS) solutions, ie, wall shear stress angle gradient (WSSAG) and oscillatory shear index (OSI). Both local and area-averaged hemodynamic wall parameters were computed for the distal common carotid artery (CCA) and the proximal ICA.\nWhen ECA flow with a normal waveform is increased from zero to 151 mL/min, area-averaged WSS values increase in the CCA, from 3.0 to 4.4 dynes/cm(2) (46%), and in the ICA, from 16.5 to 17.1 dynes/cm(2) (4%); minimum local WSS values in the carotid sinus remain less than 1 dyne/cm(2); maximum local values of WSSAG and OSI are observed in the carotid sinus and increase from 3.5 to 9.1 radian/cm (160%) and 0.23 to 0.46 (100%), respectively; CCA plus ICA area-averaged WSSAG increases by 52%, and OSI increases by 144%; and damping of the ECA waveform has little effect on local or area-averaged WSSAG but reduces OSI to 68%. When the ECA is occluded, the minimum local WSS in the carotid sinus is less than 1 dyne/cm(2). However, if the carotid sinus is removed or the CCA-ICA geometry hemodynamically optimized, the minimum WSS is approximately 4 dynes/cm(2). Similarly, eliminating the carotid sinus markedly reduces local maximum WSSAG, from 3.0-3.5 radian/cm to 0.3 radian/cm, and reduces local maximum OSI from 0.22-0.49 to 0.04. Area-averaged WSSAG and OSI over the CCA and ICA are reduced by approximately 50% with elimination of the carotid sinus.\nThe degree of adverse carotid bifurcation hemodynamics as measured with WSSAG and OSI is directly proportional to ECA flow. The marked difference in normal ICA and ECA flow waveforms does not contribute to adverse wall hemodynamics. Location of an ECA occlusion (distal, proximal, stump, smooth) does not affect adverse carotid hemodynamics; however, marked improvement is obtained with elimination of the carotid sinus.",

When the ECA is occluded, the minimum local WSS in the carotid sinus is less than 1 dyne/cm(2). However, if the carotid sinus is removed or the CCA-ICA geometry hemodynamically optimized, the minimum WSS is approximately 4 dynes/cm(2). Similarly, eliminating the carotid sinus markedly reduces local maximum WSSAG, from 3.0-3.5 radian/cm to 0.3 radian/cm, and reduces local maximum OSI from 0.22-0.49 to 0.04. Area-averaged WSSAG and OSI over the CCA and ICA are reduced by approximately 50% with elimination of the carotid sinus.",

    "abstract": "Validity of a method to improve the accuracy of carotid artery duplex scanning was tested in comparison with arteriography.\nIn 489 patients who had not previously undergone arteriography, 978 carotid arteries were examined with duplex ultrasound scanning. In method A, a linear array 7.5 MHz transducer with pulsed-wave 4.7 MHz Doppler scanning was used. For the diagnosis and grading of carotid stenosis, peak systolic and end-diastolic velocity of the Doppler waves were recorded. Method B consisted of complete ultrasound imaging and color-flow mapping with a convex array 3.5 MHz transducer with pulsed-wave 2.8 MHz Doppler scanning in all patients who had previously undergone method A. Further velocity measurements were performed at the sites of stenosis. The results of methods A and B were compared with data from neurologic assessment and arteriographic studies.\nMethod B showed significantly higher diagnostic agreement with arteriography than did method A (K 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-0.93 vs 0.79-0.85; P <.05), and the number of mistakes in grading stenosis was significantly lower (primarily because of decreased overestimation) in patients with internal carotid kinking (>60 degrees of angulation) (P <.05), distal stenosis (>20 mm from bifurcation) (P <.01), or wide acoustic shadowing (>1 cm) (P <.01) and in those without these conditions (P <.05). Compared with arteriography, diagnostic accuracy with the new method proved higher for carotid stenoses 50% or greater, 60% or greater, 70% or greater, and 80% or greater; no statistically significant difference was found for carotid stenosis 96% or greater or for carotid occlusion. Compared with data from neurologic assessment and arteriography, method B proved more accurate than method A in designating patients for carotid endarterectomy (P =.014).\nThe new method significantly improved diagnostic reliability of duplex ultrasound scanning, especially in carotid arteries with kinking, distal stenosis, or wide acoustic shadowing (32.2% of all arteries studied). In clinical practice, we suggest additional use of a lower frequency transducer in cases in which these three conditions are found or suspected at first scanning.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been recommended as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) by some clinicians. However, recently published clinical trials have reported 30-day stroke and death rates of 10% to 12%. This prompted review of our experience with CAS in patients at high risk, to document our results and guide further use of CAS.\nFrom September 1996 to the present, we performed 114 consecutive CAS procedures in 105 patients. Sixty-three patients were men (60%) and 42 patients were women (40%), with mean age of 70 years (range, 45-93 years). Indications for CAS included recurrent stenosis after previous CEA in 74 patients (65%), primary lesions in 32 patients at high risk (28%), and carotid stenosis with previous ipsilateral radiation therapy in 8 patients (7%). Asymptomatic stenosis (>80%) was managed in 70 patients (61%), and symptomatic lesions (>50%) were treated in 44 patients (39%).\nCAS was technically successful in all patients. Mean severity of stenosis before CAS was 87% +/- 6%, compared with 9% +/- 4% after CAS. Two patients (1.9%) died, 1 of reperfusion-intracerebral hemorrhage and 1 of myocardial infarction 10 days after discharge; and 1 patient (0.95%) had a stroke (retinal infarction), for a 30-day stroke and death rate of 2.85%. Two patients (1.9%) had transient neurologic events. No cranial nerve deficits were noted. No neurologic complications have been noted in the last 27 patients (26%).\nA 30-day stroke and death rate of 2.85% in our experience demonstrates acceptability of CAS as an alternative to repeat operation or primary CEA in patients at high risk or in patients with radiation-induced stenosis. We recommend further clinical investigation of CAS and participation in clinical trials by vascular surgeons.",

The presence of ICAS or AAA was determined with duplex scanning and ultrasonography.\nThe prevalence of ICAS 70% or greater is low in patients with risk factors for atherosclerosis only (1.8%-2.3%), intermediate in patients with angina pectoris or MI (3.1%), and highest in patients with PAD (12.5%) or AAA (8.8%). The prevalence of AAA 3 cm or larger is low in patients with risk factors for atherosclerosis only (0.4-1.6%), intermediate in patients with angina pectoris or MI (2.6%), and highest in patients with PAD (6.5%) or TIA, stroke, or ICAS (6.5%). The prevalence of AAA larger than 5 cm is low in all of the considered patient groups. The yield of screening can be optimized through selection on the basis of simple patient characteristics. In patients with PAD, selecting those with advanced age (>54 years) increased the prevalence of ICAS to 21.8%.

    "abstract": "On the basis of the widespread belief that aortobifemoral bypass (ABF) represents the optimal mode of revascularization for patients with diffuse aortoiliac disease, vascular surgeons are often aggressive about its application in young adults. We undertook this retrospective evaluation of ABFs performed from 1980 to 1999 to determine whether the results justify this approach. Patients of less than 50 years of age (n = 45) were compared with those aged 50 to 59 years (n = 93) and those aged more than 60 years (n = 146).\nYounger patients were more likely to undergo operation for claudication than were older patients (72% versus 59% and 55%; P <.04). Younger patients were significantly more likely to be smokers (87%) but less likely to have diabetes, hypertension, or cerebrovascular disease. Bypasses were constructed in an end-to-end fashion in 71.1% of patients of less than 50 years versus 68.8% and 71.2% of older patients (P = not significant). The mean diameter of aortic grafts was significantly smaller in younger patients (14.6 mm) than in older patients (15.6 mm and 15.5 mm; P <.01). The need for a subsequent infrainguinal reconstruction was highest in the youngest patients (24% versus 17% and 7%; P <.01). Surgical mortality rates were low in all groups (0%, 1%, and 2.0% for increasing age groups; P = not significant). Five-year primary and secondary patency rates increased significantly with each increase in age interval: 5-year primary patency rate: less than 50 years, 66% +/- 8%; 50 to 59 years, 87% +/- 5%; more than 60 years, 96% +/-2% (P <.05 for all comparisons). Five-year secondary patency rates were: less than 50 years, 79% +/- 7%; 50 to 59 years, 91% +/- 4%; more than 60 years, 98% +/- 2% (P <.05 for all comparisons). Five-year survival rate was comparable in all three groups: less than 50 years, 93% +/- 5%; 50 to 59 years, 92% +/- 4%; more than 60 years, 87% +/- 4% (P = not significant).\nIncreased virulence of aortic disease, smaller aortic size, and more progressive infrainguinal disease may all negatively impact the results of ABF in younger patients. Although 5-year results are acceptable, increased caution is warranted in the routine application of ABF in young patients without limb-threatening ischemia.",

Plasminogen, alpha(2)-plasmin inhibitor, alpha(2)-plasmin inhibitor-plasmin complex, fibrin degradation products fragment E (FDP-E), and fibrin degradation products d-dimer were monitored as markers of fibrinolysis. Blood samples were collected before surgery and on postoperative days 1, 3, 7, and 14.\nIn both groups platelet count significantly decreased on postoperative days 1 and 3, and increased on postoperative day 14. AT III significantly decreased on postoperative day 1, but recovered after postoperative day 7. FDP-E significantly increased on postoperative day 1 in both groups. There was significant correlation of aneurysm diameter with alpha(2)-plasmin inhibitor-plasmin complex, fibrin degradation products, and d-dimer in the dissection group on postoperative day 1.\nActivation of coagulation and fibrinolysis was observed after stent-grafting to treat thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection. However, no patients exhibited consumption coagulopathy postoperatively. Therefore we believe there is little risk for consumption coagulopathy after stent-grafting.",

    "abstract": "The size of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is the most important parameter for determining whether repair is appropriate. This decision, however, must be considered in the context of long-term outcome of treatment, balancing risk for rupture with mortality from the initial procedure and all subsequent secondary procedures necessary when durability is not ideal. Information on the results of endovascular repair of small versus large aneurysms has not been available.\nPreoperative imaging studies and postoperative outcome were assessed in 700 patients who underwent endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm over 6 years at a single institution. Patients were divided into two groups: 416 patients (59.4%) with aneurysms smaller than 5.5 cm in diameter and 284 patients (40.6%) with aneurysms 5.5 cm or larger in diameter. Outcome variables were assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test.\nPatients with small and large aneurysms were comparable with regard to all baseline parameters assessed, with the single exception of a small increase in age (2.3 years) in patients with large aneurysms (P =.031). While there were no differences in rate of type II endoleaks, mid-term changes in sac diameter, or aneurysm rupture between the two groups, at 24 months patients with large aneurysms had more type I leaks (6.4% +/- 2.3% vs 1.4% +/- 0.6%; P =.011), device migration (13% +/- 4.0% vs 4.4% +/- 1.8%; P =.006), and conversion to open surgical repair (8.2% +/- 3.2% vs 1.4% +/- 1.1%; P =.031). Of greatest importance, at 24 months patient survival was diminished (71% +/- 4.6% vs 86% +/- 2.8%; P <.001) and risk for aneurysm-related death was increased (6.1% +/- 2.6% vs 1.5% +/- 1.0%; P =.011) in the group with large aneurysms.\nOutcome after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm depends on size; results appear inferior in patients with larger aneurysms. These differences attain importance when choosing between observation and repair, balancing risk for rupture against size-dependent outcome.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have suggested that proximal aortic neck dilatation (AND) is a frequent event after balloon-expandable endografting. Yet few data are available on AND after repair with self-expandable stent grafts. To investigate incidence, predictive factors, and clinical consequences of AND, computed tomography (CT) scans obtained at intervals during follow-up of 230 patients who had undergone endoluminal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair with self-expandable stents were reviewed.\nBetween April 1997 and March 2001, 318 patients underwent endoluminal AAA repair with a self-expandable endograft at our unit. CT scans obtained at 1 and 12 months after surgery and yearly thereafter were prospectively stored in a computer imaging data base. Two hundred thirty patients were available for minimum 1-year assessment. Two vascular surgeons with tested interobserver agreement reviewed 686 CT scans. Diameter of the proximal aortic neck was measured as the minor axis of the first CT section that contained at least half of the proximal portion of the endograft. For endografts with suprarenal attachment the first scan below the lowest renal artery was considered. Diameter change of 3 mm or more between the CT scan at 1 month and subsequent evaluations was defined as AND. Nine possible independent predictors of AND were analyzed with Cox regression analysis.\nMedian follow-up was 24 months (range, 12-54 months). In 2 patients, AAA ruptured during follow-up. CT scans for 65 patients (28%) showed AND. Thirteen patients with AND (5.6%) underwent repeat intervention, including positioning of the proximal cuff in 8 patients and late conversion to open repair in five patients. Of the nine variables examined with multivariate analysis, only 3, ie, presence of neck circumferential thrombus (hazard ratio [HR], 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-5.01; P =.008), preoperative proximal neck diameter (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.07-135; P =.001), and preoperative AAA diameter (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.06; P =.046) were positive independent predictors of AND, whereas the other 6, ie, neck angulation more than 60 degrees, neck length, suprarenal fixation, oversizing more than 15%, endoleak at 30 days, and increased AAA diameter during follow-up, showed no significant correlation. Probability of AND at 48 months was 59 +/- 6.1 at analysis with the Kaplan-Meier method.\nAND is a frequent sequela of endoluminal repair in the mid-term. Severe AND developed in a small percentage of our patients, compromising integrity of AAA repair. Patients with large aneurysms and aortic necks and patients with aortic neck circumferential thrombus are at high risk for aortic neck enlargement after endoluminal repair of AAA.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for prevention of stroke has been demonstrated in randomized trials; however, the optimal approach in patients excluded from these trials or who have other significant comorbid conditions remains controversial, particularly with the advent of percutaneous interventions. We examined the influence of putative risk factors on outcome of CEA in a single-center experience.\nA retrospective analysis of 1370 consecutive CEA performed from 1990 to 1999 was undertaken. Preoperative risk factors examined included age older than 80 years, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure (serum creatinine concentration > 2.0 mg/dL), contralateral carotid artery occlusion, recurrent ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis, ipsilateral hemispheric symptoms within 6 weeks, and recent coronary bypass grafting (CABG). The Fisher exact test was used to identify baseline variables associated with perioperative (30 days) risk for stroke or death. Multivariate analysis with Poisson regression was used to study the effect of all univariate criteria in combination.\nIn the overall cohort, there were 32 adverse events (2.3%), including 11 deaths (0.8%), 6 disabling strokes (0.4%), and 10 nondisabling strokes (0.7%). There was no significant difference in incidence of perioperative stroke or death between patients with one or more risk factors (n = 689) and those with no risk factors (low risk, n = 681). Thirty-day mortality was significantly greater in patients with two or more risk factors compared with patients with no risk factors (2.8% vs 0.3%; P =.04), but no significant difference was noted in perioperative stroke rate (2.3% vs 1.0%). Univariate analysis demonstrated that contralateral carotid occlusion (n = 75) was the only significant predictor of adverse outcome (5 events, 6.7%) among the variables tested; this was confirmed with multivariate analysis (relative risk, 4.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.3; P =.01). Five-year survival for patients with two or more risk factors was notably diminished compared with that for patients with no risk factors (38.7% +/- 5.9% vs 75.0% +/- 2.6%; P <.001). Contralateral occlusion was also associated with reduced 5-year survival (38 +/- 11% vs 67 +/- 2%; P <.004).\nCEA can be safely performed in patients deemed at high risk, including those aged 80 years or older and others with significant comorbid conditions, with combined stroke and mortality rates comparable to those found in randomized trials, ie, the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study and the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. Contralateral occlusion may be a predictor for moderately increased perioperative risk and for reduced long-term survival. Caution may be warranted in asymptomatic patients with multiple risk factors, in whom presumed long-term benefit of CEA may be compromised by markedly reduced 5-year survival.",

    "abstract": "We examined whether preoperative duplex ultrasound scanning (DU) could replace contrast material-enhanced arteriography (CA) in selecting the recipient artery of tibial or peroneal artery bypass grafts.\nIn patients who underwent tibial or peroneal artery bypass grafting because of critical ischemia, images were obtained of the lower extremity arterial circulation with both DU and CA. Vascular surgeons, blinded to the operation performed, reviewed either DU or CA images for arterial visualization and patency. The tibial or peroneal artery best suited to receive the bypass graft was selected by surgeons using only data from either DU or CA images. This selection was compared with the artery actually used at bypass surgery.\nPreoperative DU and CA data for 40 lower extremities in 38 patients undergoing bypass grafting at the level of the tibia provided 110 arteries: 38 anterior tibial arteries, 32 peroneal arteries, and 40 posterior tibial arteries. Ten arteries (8 peroneal, 2 anterior tibial) were not identified with DU, and 1 artery (anterior tibial) was not identified with CA. DU enabled prediction of the artery actually used in 88% of patients (35 of 40), whereas CA enabled prediction of the artery actually used in 93% of patients (37 of 40; P =.59). Duplicate findings at DU and CA enabled selection of 85% of arteries actually used (95% confidence interval, 71%-93%). Arteries used for bypass grafting had significantly higher peak systolic velocity (35 cm/s vs 25 cm/s; P =.04), higher end-diastolic velocity (15 cm/s vs 9 cm/s; P =.005), and greater diameter (2.4 mm vs 1.7 mm; P =.003) compared with arteries not selected for bypass grafting.\nFindings at DU and CA typically agree when used to select tibial or peroneal arteries for bypass grafting. With DU there is occasional difficulty in identification of the peroneal artery, but selection of the actual artery used is accurate. Peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, and diameter characteristics correlate with arteriographic criteria for tibial bypass target artery selection. If DU enables adequate identification of a target artery for bypass grafting, and especially if the peroneal artery is seen, findings at CA are not likely to alter bypass execution.",

With DU there is occasional difficulty in identification of the peroneal artery, but selection of the actual artery used is accurate. Peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, and diameter characteristics correlate with arteriographic criteria for tibial bypass target artery selection. If DU enables adequate identification of a target artery for bypass grafting, and especially if the peroneal artery is seen, findings at CA are not likely to alter bypass execution.",

    "abstract": "Although evidence suggests that end-stage renal disease is associated with poor limb salvage and patient survival after arterial revascularization, little is known about the effect of renal transplantation. We analyzed the outcome in patients with renal transplants who underwent infrainguinal bypass procedures.\nData prospectively entered into our vascular registry were reviewed for all patients who underwent lower extremity bypass procedures from January 1, 1990, through January 31, 2002. Sixty patients were identified who had a functioning renal allograft at infrainguinal revascularization. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for limb salvage, patency, and patient survival and were compared with the Mantel-Cox log- rank test.\nSixty patients (40 men, 20 women; mean age, 47.1 years) underwent 76 bypass procedures in 71 limbs. Preoperative demographic data included diabetes (59 of 60 patients, 98.3%), coronary artery disease (26 of 60 patients, 43.3%), and preoperative serum creatinine concentration (SCr) greater than 2.0 mg/dL (9 of 60 patients, 11.7%). Mean follow-up was 25.1 months. Overall major complication rate was 11.8%, and 30-day mortality rate was 1.3%. Survival was 93.3% at 1 year and 66.6% at 5 years. Limb salvage was 87% at 1 year and 78% at 5 years. Primary graft patency was 78% at 1 year and 44% at 5 years. Preoperative SCr less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL was associated with improved overall patient survival (5-year survival, 73.4% vs 37.5%; P =.01, log-rank test). Limb salvage and patency rates were not significantly affected by preoperative SCr greater than 2.0 mg/dL.\nLower extremity bypass can be performed safely and effectively in patients who have undergone renal transplantation. However, the importance of a well-functioning renal allograft at surgery is demonstrated by marked improvement in patient survival.",

We evaluated the results of stent-graft placement as an option for treatment of these diseases.\nDemographic data for patients undergoing stent-grafting in one or more iliac artery segments were recorded. Technical, clinical, and hemodynamic success, and aortoiliac primary and secondary patency were analyzed with Society for Vascular Surgery/American Association for Vascular Surgery criteria.\nThirty-four consecutive patients underwent stent-graft treatment because of rest pain (65%) or tissue loss (35%). Mean patient age was 63 years, and 38% of patients were women. Ninety-one percent of patients had hypertension, 71% had coronary artery disease, 21% had renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL), and 26% had diabetes; 71% were active smokers. TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus C or D disease was present in 85% of patients, complete common or external iliac artery occlusion was present in 41%, and external iliac artery disease requiring treatment was present in 94% of patients. Mean lesion length was 13.7 +/- 8 cm. Technical, hemodynamic, and clinical success was achieved in all patients in whom the lesion could be crossed with a wire.

Eighty percent (four of five) of primary patency failures were in patients who did not undergo concomitant common femoral endarterectomy at initial stent graft placement.\nEarly results of stent-graft placement to treat diffuse aortoiliac occlusive disease appear better than our recent experience with stenting alone.

    "abstract": "Surgical treatment of intact thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) is crucial to prevent rupture but is associated with high perioperative mortality. We tested the hypothesis that provider volume of surgical treatment of TAAA is an important determinant of operative outcome. Patients and methods Clinical information regarding repair of intact TAAA in 1542 patients from 1988 to 1998 was obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), a stratified discharge database of a representative 20% of US hospitals. Demographic data included age, sex, race, nature of admission, and comorbid conditions. Annual hospital volume of TAAA treated was grouped into terciles and defined as low (LVH; 1-3 cases [median, 1]), medium (MVH; 2-9 cases [median, 4]), or high (HVH; 5-31 cases [median, 12]). Annual surgeon volume was defined as low (LVS; 1-2 cases [median, 1]) or high (HVS; 3-18 cases [median, 7]). The primary outcome measure was in-hospital postoperative mortality. Secondary outcome measures included length of stay, and cardiac, pulmonary, and renal complications. Adjusted and unadjusted analyses were conducted.\nOverall mortality was 22.3%. Mortality improved over time. LVH and HVH differed in mortality rates (27.4% vs 15.0%; P <.001). Mortality between LVS and HVS also differed significantly (25.6% vs 11.0%; P <.001). When controlling for patient demographic data, comorbid conditions, and postoperative complications, both hospital and surgeon volume were significant predictors of mortality for intact TAAA repair (LVS: odds ratio [OR] 2.6, P <.001; LVH: OR 2.2, P <.001; and MVH: OR 1.7, P =.004).\nGreater hospital and surgeon TAAA treatment volumes contribute to better outcome. Given the relative high perioperative mortality associated with TAAA repair, regionalization of care to high-volume providers with consistently lower postoperative mortality deserves consideration by patients, physicians, and health care planners.",

    "abstract": "Suprarenal fixation of aortic endografts appears to be a safe option in patients with a short or conical proximal aortic neck. However, concern persists regarding the long-term effect on renal function when renal artery ostia are crossed by the uncovered stent. We investigated the effect of suprarenal versus infrarenal endograft fixation on renal function and renal artery patency after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair.\nRecords of 91 patients who underwent endovascular aortic aneurysm repair with a modular bifurcated stent graft between November 1999 and January 2002 were reviewed retrospectively. Two patients receiving dialysis because of chronic renal failure were excluded. Infrarenal fixation was used in 57 patients (group 1), and suprarenal fixation was used in 32 patients (group 2). In two patients in group 1 a Gianturco Z stent was inserted transrenally because of intraoperative proximal type I endoleak, and data for these patients were excluded from analysis. Follow-up evaluation was performed at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter, and included clinical assessment, measurement of serum creatinine concentration (SCr), and computed tomography angiography, per standard protocol. Median follow-up was 12 months (range, 1-36 months).\nThere was no statistically significant difference in patient demographic data, aneurysm size, or preoperative risk factors. Median SCr was significantly higher in group 2 (suprarenal fixation) than in group 1 (infrarenal fixation) preoperatively (1.2 mg/dL [range, 0.6-2.3 mg/dL] vs 0.9 mg/dL [range, 0.6-1.9 mg/dL], P =.008) and at 1 month postoperatively (1.1 mg/dL [range, 0.8-5.6 mg/dL] vs 1.0 mg/dL [range, 0.6-2.1 mg/dL], P =.045). There was a significant increase in median SCr in both groups at 1 month postoperatively (group 1, 1.0 mg/dL [range, 0.6-2.1 mg/dL], P =.05; group 2, 1.1 mg/dL [range, 0.8-5.6 mg/dL] [mean SCr, 1.35 mg/dL vs 1.15 mg/dL, respectively], P <.05). In group 1 SCr was increased significantly at 6 and 12 months (P <.001), whereas in group 2 SCr also increased at 6 and 12 months, but not significantly. The change in SCr over time was not significantly different between the two groups. In two of 32 patients in group 2, renal artery occlusion developed, associated with perfusion defects in renal parenchyma and persistently elevated SCr. Analysis of renal artery patency did not demonstrate any association between patency and treatment. No patient developed hypertension during follow-up.\nSuprarenal endograft fixation does not lead to significant renal dysfunction, and renal artery occlusion is uncommon within 12 months. A larger study with longer follow-up is essential to determine overall effects on renal function and renal artery patency.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) may be limited by persistent perfusion of the aneurysm sac (endoleak). Endoleak that results in persistent systemic pressurization of the aneurysm or in continued AAA expansion is believed to require treatment to prevent rupture. This report describes the results of three techniques used to treat endoleak.\nEndovascular repair of AAA was performed in 597 patients between January 1996 and September 2002. Seventy-three endoleaks that required treatment developed in 70 patients (11.7%). These involved the graft attachment site (type I) or the graft junction site (type III) or originated from collateral side-branch vessels (type II) and were associated with an increase in aneurysm size. Endoleak type was confirmed at angiography in all cases. Average time between the initial endovascular procedure and endoleak treatment was 14.5 +/- 5.7 months. The techniques used for endoleak treatment were deployment of an endovascular extension graft or cuff (n = 44), coil embolization (n = 24,) and conversion to conventional open repair (n = 5). Configurations of endovascular grafts in which endoleak developed were bifurcated (n = 44), aortouniiliac (n = 15), and aortoaortic-tube (n = 11). Mean follow-up after endoleak treatment was 24.5 +/- 12.2 months (range, 1-60 months).\nEndovascular extension grafts or cuffs were used to treat 41 attachment site endoleaks and 3 graft junction endoleaks, with overall technical success rate of 97%. Embolic coils were used to treat 16 retrograde side-branch endoleaks and 8 attachment site endoleaks, with overall technical success rate of 87%. Conversion to open surgery was performed in 4 patients with attachment site endoleaks and 1 patient with a graft junction site endoleak, and was successful in all cases. After endoleak treatment, aneurysm size decreased (>5 mm) in 38% of patients, stabilized in 58% of patients, and increased (>5 mm) in 4% of patients. Major morbidity occurred in 7.0%, with no perioperative deaths.\nEndovascular extension grafts, coil embolization, and conversion to open surgery each may be used to effectively repair endoleak. Selection of the treatment method used is determined by the anatomic characteristics of the endoleak and the patient's ability to tolerate conventional repair. Conversion to open repair was uniformly successful. Deployment of an extension cuff was successful when complete closure of the endoleak was achieved. Embolic coils were effective for retrograde endoleaks and provided stabilization of AAA size in selected patients with attachment site endoleaks in limited follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing midline incision for abdominal aortic reconstruction appear to be at greater risk for postoperative incision hernia compared with patients undergoing celiotomy for general surgical procedures. Controversy exists as to whether incidence of abdominal wall hernia and increased risk for incision hernia is higher in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) than in patients operated on because of aortoiliac occlusive disease (AOD). We conducted a prospective multi-institutional study to assess frequency of incision hernia after aortic surgery through a midline laparotomy and of previous abdominal wall hernia.\nPatients with AAA (n = 177) or AOD (n = 82) from three major institutions were prospectively enrolled in the study and examined. Data collected included demographic data, cardiopulmonary risk factors, smoking status, history of previous or current abdominal wall hernia (incision, inguinal, umbilical, femoral), previous midline incision, suture type, and postoperative complications. At a minimum of 6 months after laparotomy, patients were evaluated clinically for a new incision hernia. Differences were tested with the unpaired t test, X(2) test, or Fisher exact test, and multiple logistic regression was used to control for confounding variables.\nMean follow-up of the cohort was 32.8 +/- 2.3 months. Rate of abdominal wall hernia and inguinal hernia in patients with AAA versus AOD was 38.4% versus 11% (P =.001) and 23.7% versus 6.1% (P =.003), respectively. Rate of postoperative incision hernia in patients with AAA was 28.2%, and in patients with AOD was 11.0% (P =.002). Adjusting for age, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, body mass index, diabetes, bowel obstruction, and suture type, patients with AAA had almost a ninefold risk for postoperative incision hernia formation (odds ratio [OR], 8.8; P =.0049).\nCompared with patients with AOD, patients with AAA have a higher frequency of abdominal wall hernia and inguinal hernia, and are at significant increased risk for development of incision hernia postoperatively. The higher frequency of hernia formation in patients with AAA suggests the presence of a structural defect within the fascia. Further studies are needed to delineate the molecular changes of the aorta and its relation to the abdominal wall fascia.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated mid-term results of the multicenter EVT/Guidant aortouniiliac endograft (AI) trial and ascertained the durability of this endovascular technique in patients unable to undergo standard bifurcated endografting.\nFrom November 1996 to December 1998, 121 patients were enrolled to receive the AI device on the basis of complex iliac artery anatomy contraindicating bifurcated endografting. Clinical data were centrally collected, and radiographic data were evaluated by core facility.\nAI placement was technically successful in 113 of 121 patients. At operation, patients who underwent AI had significantly more arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and peripheral occlusive disease (P <.05) compared with patients who underwent open aneurysmorrhaphy in the EVT/Guidant trials, indicating comorbid features in this anatomic cohort. Distal AI attachment was performed to the external iliac artery in 40 (36%) patients. Median follow-up was 38 months. In the AI group, overall aneurysm diameter decreased over the duration of study from 54.4 +/- 9.6 mm to 44.4 +/- 16.4 mm (P =.004). At 24 and 36 months after repair, reduction in aneurysm size was associated with absence of endoleak (P =.003 and P =.008, respectively). Aneurysms shrunk or remained stable in 109 (96.5%) patients. Endoleak was identified in 52.3% of patients at discharge, and at follow-up in 30.9% at 1 year, 34.8% at 2 years, 28.6% at 3 years, and 30.4% at 4 years. Type II endoleak predominated. Leak from failure to completely occlude contralateral iliac flow accounted for 8 of 58 endoleaks (13.8%) at discharge. Sixteen patients (14.2%) underwent postoperative endoleak treatment; in one of these patients open conversion was necessary at 20 months. Post-procedure thigh or buttock claudication developed in 16 patients (14.2%). Thirteen patients (81.3%) had either distal attachment in the external iliac artery or contralateral type IIA occlusion. Fifteen patients (13.3%) required intervention because of reduced limb flow; one of these patients underwent open conversion at 27 months, and another underwent axillofemoral grafting at 28 months. Device migration was confirmed in 2 (1.8%) patients, without current clinical sequelae. Whereas no femorofemoral graft thromboses occurred, graft infection developed in 3 patients (2.6%). During follow-up, aneurysm in 2 patients ruptured. Late death occurred in 41 patients (36.3%). Twenty-four patients (58.5%) died of cardiopulmonary disease; one death was endograft-related after aneurysm rupture; and one death was related to femorofemoral bypass infection. Actuarial survival was 78.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71%-86%) at 2 years and 63.4% (95% CI, 54%-73%) at 4 years.\nIn patients with significant comorbid conditions and complex iliac anatomy unfavorable for bifurcated endografting, AI with femorofemoral bypass grafting is safe and effective. In most patients this endovascular option provides satisfactory mid-term results.",

    "abstract": "Exposed or infected peripheral vascular grafts pose a significant challenge to the vascular surgeon. Although graft removal and extraanatomic bypass is feasible in selected circumstances, this procedure is generally not applicable for bypass to the pedal vessels. Preservation of patent grafts is almost always required for limb salvage. We present a case report of an exposed vein graft to the dorsalis pedis artery. We conclude that a local fasciocutaneous flap is an excellent treatment option, and describe the procedure in detail.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is distinctly uncommon in infants and children, and usually results from infection, iatrogenic trauma, vasculitis, connective tissue disorder, or tuberous sclerosis. Congenital \"primary\" neonatal AAA is exceedingly rare. The few reported cases of repair of congenital AAA describe use of synthetic graft material or aneurysmorrhaphy. We report the first successful treatment of a known 6 cm congenital infrarenal AAA repaired with a 5 mm cryopreserved allograft in a 4-month-old infant girl. The graft was pretreated with an antigen reduction process (SynerGraft), which preliminary studies suggest may inhibit allograft degeneration. The postoperative course was unremarkable. Lower extremity pulses and results of duplex ultrasound flow studies remained excellent at 14-month follow-up. Panel reactive antibodies against class I alloantigens remain negative. The use of an antigen-reduced allograft provides an acceptable conduit, which potentially may decrease allograft degeneration and relative graft stenosis associated with growth of the child, but requires follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Effective endovascular repair of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) requires adequate proximal and distal landing zones to allow secure endograft attachment. We report a patient with an infrarenal AAA originating 3 mm below the left renal artery with cardiac morbidity that precluded open AAA repair. Left renal artery relocation with retroperitoneal iliorenal bypass grafting was performed to lengthen the proximal landing zone, which facilitated successful endovascular AAA repair. Postoperative surveillance after 3 years showed aneurysm reduction with a patent iliorenal bypass graft. This case underscores the utility of a combined open and endovascular approach in treatment of a challenging aortic aneurysm.",

Angiography revealed peripheral arterial occlusion of both legs and arms. Detailed laboratory examination excluded collagen disease, a hypercoagulable state, and juvenile atherosclerosis. Below-knee amputation of the left leg was performed. Typical histologic findings of Buerger's disease were observed in the crural arteries and saphenous veins. The clinical course was uneventful after the patient stopped smoking. This is the second case report of Buerger's disease in a woman in the second decade of life. It is important that a correct diagnosis of Buerger's disease be established, because the disease process is benign, compared with collagen disease, if the patient stops smoking.",

Emergency laparotomy was performed because of suspected intestinal ischemia, and the terminal ileum and cecum and part of the ascending colon were resected. In total, the patient underwent laparotomy four times. Histopathologic findings revealed that the arteries and veins of the resected small intestine were occluded with organized thrombi. Inflammatory cell infiltration was recognized mainly in the intima. These findings are compatible with Buerger disease.",

    "abstract": "Although varicose veins are a common cause of morbidity, etiologic factors predisposing to dilatation, elongation, and tortuosity of the saphenous vein and its tributaries are poorly understood. We compared histologic features of normal and varicose saphenous veins and investigated the role of enzyme or inhibitor imbalance in development of varicosities.\nEight normal and 10 varicose (C(2,3)E(P,S)A(S)P(R,O)) vein segments were used for this analysis. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and activity were analyzed with Western blotting and zymography. Venous architecture and protein localization were determined with histology and immunohistochemistry.\nWestern blot analysis demonstrated the presence of MMP- 1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-12, as well as small quantities of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 in protein isolates from normal and varicose veins. Both vein types demonstrated MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-12 activity by gelatin zymography, although varicose vein expressed less MMP-9 activity than normal vein did. Compared with normal veins, changes in varicose veins were not uniformly distributed along the circumference; areas of intimal thickening were often interspersed with focal areas of dilatation. Fragmentation of elastic lamellae and loss of circular and longitudinal muscle fibers were evident in the varicosities. Focal aggregates of macrophages were detected within the media and adventitia of both normal and varicose veins. MMP-1 and MMP-9 were expressed in both types of vein segments; however, their immunohistochemical localization was distinctly different. In normal vein, endothelial cells, occasional smooth muscle cells (SMC), and adventitial microvessels expressed MMP-1, whereas its expression was localized to fibroblasts, SMC, and endothelial cells throughout involved portions of varicose veins. MMP-9 was localized to endothelial cells, medial SMC, and adventitial microvessels in both normal and varicose veins, although varicose veins demonstrated increased medial smooth muscle cell staining. MMP-12 was found in SMC and fibroblasts in both normal and varicose veins. Neither TIMP-1 nor TIMP-2 were detected with immunohistochemistry in any specimens examined.\nThere are distinct differences in the structural architecture and localization of MMP expression in normal and varicose veins. Although the changes observed are not sufficiently definitive to enable a causal relationship, they do suggest a possible mechanism for the alterations in matrix composition observed between normal and varicose veins.",

Focal aggregates of macrophages were detected within the media and adventitia of both normal and varicose veins. MMP-1 and MMP-9 were expressed in both types of vein segments; however, their immunohistochemical localization was distinctly different. In normal vein, endothelial cells, occasional smooth muscle cells (SMC), and adventitial microvessels expressed MMP-1, whereas its expression was localized to fibroblasts, SMC, and endothelial cells throughout involved portions of varicose veins. MMP-9 was localized to endothelial cells, medial SMC, and adventitial microvessels in both normal and varicose veins, although varicose veins demonstrated increased medial smooth muscle cell staining. MMP-12 was found in SMC and fibroblasts in both normal and varicose veins. Neither TIMP-1 nor TIMP-2 were detected with immunohistochemistry in any specimens examined.",

    "abstract": "Microemboli passing through the cerebral artery downstream from high-grade carotid artery stenosis produce transient ischemic symptoms and may result in stroke. Rupture of carotid artery plaque is the main source of microemboli in high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis. However, the mechanisms underlying plaque rupture are unclear. We hypothesized that vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from plaque in patients with symptoms of carotid artery stenosis undergo increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation, compared with VSMC in patients without symptoms.\nVSMC were isolated by means of enzymatic dissociation from plaque removed at carotid endarterectomy in patients with symptoms of carotid artery stenosis, eg, hemispheric transient ischemic attacks, amaurosis fugax, or stroke, and patients with high-grade stenosis without symptoms. VSMC were cultured and immunostained with smooth muscle alpha-actin and caldesmon antibodies to ensure purity. TUNEL assay and annexin V labeling were performed to identify VSMC undergoing apoptosis. Proliferation assay with [(3)H] thymidine incorporation was performed in VSMC stimulated with fetal bovine serum (FBS), and cell cycle profile was analyzed with DNA staining with Vindelov reagent.\nWe isolated VSMC from symptomatic plaque that showed gross ulceration, and asymptomatic plaque. Apoptosis, as measured with the TUNEL assay, in VSMC from symptomatic plaque was 5.45% +/- 0.8%, and in asymptomatic plaque was 1.20% +/- 0.2%. Annexin V labeling revealed that 26.8% +/- 3.8% cells were labeled for phosphatidylserine in VSMC in symptomatic plaque, compared with 4.8% +/- 0.3% cells in asymptomatic plaque. VSMC in asymptomatic plaque showed significantly increased uptake of [(3)H] thymidine at all concentrations of FBS, compared with symptomatic plaque. In the presence of 10% FBS, VSMC from asymptomatic plaque progressed through the S phase of the cell cycle, whereas significantly increased numbers of VSMC from symptomatic plaque were arrested in the S phase.\nIncreased numbers of VSMC from symptomatic plaque undergo apoptosis, compared with VSMC from asymptomatic plaque. This could be due to inability of VSMC from symptomatic plaque to progress beyond the S phase of the cell cycle. Decreased proliferation and increased loss of VSMC as a result of apoptosis in symptomatic plaque may result in plaque rupture, leading to development of symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), an extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein, is associated with a variety of cellular processes relevant to atherosclerosis and intimal hyperplasia, including vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) is associated with basement membrane and ECM degradation, important processes for cell migration. We hypothesized that TSP-1 modulates MMP2 activity in VSMCs and is critical for VSMC migration.\nQuiescent bovine aortic VSMCs (48 hours) were incubated in serum-free media (SFM) with or without TSP-1 (10 or 20 microg/mL). Gelatinase activity was measured with zymography to determine pro-MMP2 and MMP2 activity. MMP2 messenger RNA expression was determined with Northern blot analysis. Invasion assays were performed. A binding assay was used to determine the specificity of TSP-1 binding to MMP2. Blots were quantified with densitometry, and all comparisons were made with a paired t test.\nTSP-1 induced production of activated forms of MMP2, as well as upregulation of pro-MMP2. MMP2 mRNA was upregulated 1.7-fold by TSP-1 at 10 and 20 microg/mL. GM6001, an MMP inhibitor, inhibited VSMC migration across the matrix barrier, whereas migration that occurred in the absence of the matrix barrier was unaffected. With a binding assay, TSP-1 interacted physically with MMP2, and TSP-1-bound MMP2 showed the strongest binding activity in comparison with collagen I, fibronectin, and elastin.\nTSP-1 induced MMP2 activation through transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is associated with chronic transmural inflammation and destruction of the elastic media. The purpose of this study was to elucidate molecular mechanisms that might orchestrate leukocyte recruitment into the outer aortic wall by determining whether CC chemokines contribute to development of aneurysm degeneration in an elastase-induced mouse model of AAA.\nAdult male C57BL/6J mice underwent transient elastase perfusion of the abdominal aorta to induce development of AAA. At various intervals after elastase perfusion (0, 4, 7, 14 days), real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure aortic wall expression of the CC (beta) chemokines, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). Expression of these chemokines by cultured mouse aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMC) was similarly assessed after transient (5 minutes) exposure to elastase solutions in vitro.\nMouse aortic diameter (mean +/- SEM) increased to aneurysmal proportions by 14 days after elastase perfusion (from 0.51 +/- 0.03 mm to 1.34 +/- 0.32 mm; 163% increase; P <.05), with macrophage infiltration of the outer aortic wall beginning within 7 to 10 days. Increased aortic wall messenger RNA expression for MCP-1 (28-fold) and RANTES (11-fold) was observed on day 4, with maximal production of chemokine protein on day 7 (MCP-1, from 7.07 +/- 0.06 ng/mL to 19.60 +/- 0.19 ng/mL; P <.001; RANTES, from 0.23 +/- 0.006 ng/mL to 2.03 +/- 0.057 ng/mL; P <.001). Neither MCP-1 nor RANTES was detected in normal mouse aorta with immunohistochemistry, but both chemokines were abundant in AAA. Within 48 hours of transient exposure to elastase, cultured mouse AoSMC exhibited pronounced induction (>90-fold) of MCP-1 and RANTES, despite concomitant decrease in cell numbers.\nIncreased mouse aortic wall expression of MCP-1 and RANTES occurs early in development of elastase-induced AAA and before onset of the chronic inflammatory response. Moreover, elastase directly stimulates AoSMC chemokine production in vitro. Elastase-induced medial SMC production of CC chemokines may therefore provide an important link between enzymatic injury, leukocyte recruitment, and aneurysmal degeneration of the aortic wall.",

Thus the role of CEA in the treatment of extracranial carotid artery occlusive disease in black patients remains unclear. We undertook this study to determine the effect of black race on early and late outcome of CEA.\nA retrospective review was performed of records for patients who underwent CEA from 1990 to 1999. Data on demographics, operative indications, hospital course, and long-term follow-up were obtained for each patient. Patients were stratified by race for comparison of perioperative course and late outcome. Risk factors were compared using chi(2) methods, and life table analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier survival plots.\nOne thousand forty-five CEA procedures were performed during the study period, 133 (13%) in black patients and 912 (87%) in white patients. Demographic risk factors were similar in both groups, except for hypertension (P =.003), diabetes (P <.001), and renal insufficiency (P =.03), which were more prevalent in blacks. Just over half of patients had symptoms at presentation, with equal racial distribution. The perioperative stroke and death rate was 3.3% (blacks, 5.3%; whites, 3.1%; P =.19). The 8-year actuarial ipsilateral stroke rate was 7% in patients without symptoms and 8% in patients with symptoms, with no racial variation. There was, however, a racial difference in the long-term \"all strokes\" rate (P =.002), regardless of vascular territory. This difference was largely due to the high late stroke rate in black patients with symptoms at presentation. A Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that only black race was a significant predictor of any stroke.\nCEA can be accomplished with acceptable morbidity and mortality in black patients with an expectation of similar protection from ipsilateral ischemic stroke as in white patients. Black patients, however, have a higher incidence of all strokes at long-term follow-up due to the higher risk of stroke in patients with symptoms of carotid bifurcation disease.",

    "abstract": "The external iliac artery has physical characteristics, in particular, caliber and length, similar to those of the renal artery and would thus seem to be an ideal substitute for it. However, there are no studies in the literature designed to confirm this possibility. The present study was designed to demonstrate the feasibility of use of the external iliac artery as a substitute for the renal artery in surgical revascularization of renal artery fibrodysplasia and to assess the long-term biologic behavior of the external iliac artery so used.\nTwelve patients (11 female, 1 male), ages 1 to 43 years (mean, 24.4 years), with severe hypertension underwent aortorenal bypass grafting with use of the external iliac artery to treat preocclusive stenotic lesions (n = 7), complete occlusion (n = 3), or aneurysm (n = 2) of the renal artery. It was considered unnecessary to reestablish circulation in the donor limb in 2 patients (young children), and transposition of the ipsilateral internal iliac artery was performed in 9 patients; in the remaining patient circulation was reestablished with insertion of an iliofemoral prosthesis.\nThere were no operative deaths. In 1 patient nephrectomy was necessary because of occlusion of the graft as a consequence of technical complications. In 8 patients there was immediate normalization of blood pressure without aid of medication, and in the remaining 3 patients an antihypertensive drug was prescribed. Two patients were lost to follow-up; the other 9 were assessed with angiography at a mean of 8.8 years after the operation. All grafts were found to be in excellent condition, with no evidence of dilatation, kinking, twisting, anastomotic fibroplasia, or wall irregularities.\nOn the basis of this experience, the external iliac artery is confirmed as a substitute for the renal artery, and the excellent long-term results would seem to make it particularly useful in young patients with long life expectancy, such as those with renal artery fibrodysplasia.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral vascular occlusive disease (PVOD) and rheumatologic disease (RD) are common in older patients. The effect that coexistence of these diseases may have on patient health has not been rigorously investigated. The present study was undertaken in an attempt to characterize patients with PVOD plus RD in terms of inflammatory serologic disorders, medications, and procedures, and their relation to limb salvage.\nMedical records were reviewed retrospectively for all patients with diagnosed coexistent PVOD and non-arteritis RD treated over 15 years at the University of Michigan Hospital. Demographics, operative and medical therapies, and serologic studies were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analysis and the Kaplan-Meier method were used to assess these variables in relation to limb salvage.\nForty-one patients (34 women, 7 men), with mean age of 67 years, were studied. Mean antinuclear antibody titer was 274, C-reactive protein concentration was 3.1 mg/mL, and sedimentation rate was 49. Twenty-nine percent of patients had claudication, 49% had rest pain, and 32% had tissue loss. Mean ankle brachial index was 0.55. Medications included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (67% of patients), corticosteroids (54%), and specific immunosuppressive agents (27%). Operative therapy included aortofemoral bypass grafting (n = 4), infrainguinal bypass grafting (n = 14), embolectomy (n = 4), and primary amputation (n = 7). Overall 5-year limb salvage rate was 70% in patients undergoing bypass surgery. Comparison of surgical with nonsurgical patients showed no significant differences in baseline risk factors, serologic disorders, or anatomic location of vascular disease. Multivariate analysis revealed that rest pain and lack of immunosuppression were significantly predictive of need for revascularization or amputation (P <.05).\nPatients with RD should receive treatment on the basis of standard criteria for limb ischemia, in that surgical revascularization outcomes are satisfactory. Immunosuppressive agents may confer a protective effect against progression of PVOD.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to investigate the extent to which health-related quality of life (HQOL) is reduced in young women with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) compared with age-matched and gender-matched control subjects. Moreover, potential determinants of HQOL in young women with PAD were studied, ie, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, location of stenosis and time since diagnosis.\nThis was a population-based case-control study. Subjects were 208 young (<50 years) women with PAD diagnosed at angiography and 471 population-based age-matched and gender-matched control subjects. All participants completed the RAND-36 questionnaire, which produces a HQOL profile. The questionnaire contains 36 items that assess 8 domains of HQOL. Each domain is given a mean score ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of better quality of life.\nPAD had a deleterious effect on HQOL in young women. Ability to deal with the physical requirements of daily life was affected, and physical capabilities limited activity to a considerable extent. Mean differences observed for 2 domains, ie, Physical functioning and Role-physical, were -25.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], -28.8,-21.4) and -22.5 (95% CI, -28.9,-16.0). Within the group of young women with PAD, HQOL did not depend on age, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, or education. However, women with hyperglycemia, hypertension, or increased body mass index scored lower on 1 or more domains of RAND-36. Location of stenosis was also related to HQOL; patients with more proximal stenosis scored slightly higher on the domain Physical functioning, compared with women with more distal stenosis. Time (0-10 years) between diagnosis (1990-1999) and when RAND-36 was filled out (2000) is related to score on the Mental health domain; score increases over time. Scores on the other 7 domains of HQOL showed no significant relation to duration of disease.\nQuality of life in young women with PAD was statistically significant diminished for all domains of RAND-36 in comparison with HQOL in healthy age-matched control subjects. HQOL of patients with recently diagnosed PAD is comparable to that of patients in whom the diagnosis was made several years previously. Effective therapy might stabilize, albeit not improve, quality of life in this specific patient population.",

    "abstract": "The outcome for a wide variety of diseases and treatment methods varies by gender. In an effort to determine whether gender has a role in the outcome of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair, we analyzed data from consecutive patients treated at a single institution over 6 years.\nOver 6 years ending in March 2002, 704 patients underwent endovascular repair of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm at The Cleveland Clinic. Six hundred six patients (86.1%) were men and 98 patients (13.9%) were women. Preprocedure and postprocedure imaging studies were evaluated to determine the frequency of aneurysm sac shrinkage or growth, defined as diameter change equal to or greater than 5 mm. Presence and type of endoleak was assessed with non-contrast material-enhanced, post-contrast-enhanced, and delayed post-contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans. These and other clinical variables were assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox-Mantel log-rank test, and values were expressed as mean +/- SE.\nMale and female patients were comparable with respect to baseline comorbid conditions. Women, however, were slightly older (76.7 +/- 0.7 years vs 74.4 +/- 0.3 years; P =.009), and had slightly smaller aneurysms (5.2 +/- 0.1 cm vs 5.4 +/- 0.04 cm; P =.033). There were no gender-specific differences in perioperative mortality (men, 1.3%; women, 3.1%; P =.197) or mid-term (24 months) survival (men, 80% +/- 2.6%; women, 78% +/- 8.1%). Similarly, there were no differences at 24 months in risk for graft migration (7.5% +/- 2.0% vs 5.4% +/- 3.2%), need for secondary remedial procedures (24% +/- 2.9% vs 21% +/- 6.3%), conversion to open surgery (3.9% +/- 1.5% vs 3.8% +/-2.7%), or post-repair aneurysm rupture (1.1% +/- 0.9% vs 2.2% +/-2.2%) in male and female patients, respectively. In contrast, risk for graft limb occlusion at 24 months was significantly higher in women than in men (11% +/- 5.2% vs 3.3% +/- 1.1%; P =.022). While frequency of endoleak of any type did not differ among male and female patients, aneurysm sac shrinkage at 24 months was more rapid in women (76% +/- 8.1% vs 57% +/- 3.5%; P =.019).\nWith the exception of slightly older age and somewhat smaller aneurysm, female patients are similar to male patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair. A greater frequency of graft limb occlusion was observed in female patients, but no statistically significant differences were detected in survival, rupture risk, or need for secondary procedures. Moreover, a more rapid rate of aneurysm sac shrinkage was detected in women. These observations suggest that endovascular aneurysm repair should be offered to suitable candidates irrespective of gender.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has been suggested as a technique to improve outcome of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Whether this technique becomes an established treatment will depend, in part, on the anatomy of ruptured AAA.\nThe anatomy of intact and ruptured AAA seen in a university department of vascular surgery over 5 years was reviewed. Aneurysm anatomy was assessed with spiral computed tomographic angiography. Suitability for EVAR was assessed from the dimensions of the proximal neck and common iliac arteries. Neck length less than 15 mm, neck width greater than 30 mm, and common iliac artery diameter greater than 22 mm were declared unsuitable for EVAR.\nThree hundred sixty-three patients with intact AAA and 46 with ruptured AAA were identified. Larger intact aneurysms were significantly associated with longer renal artery-bifurcation distance and more complex proximal neck architecture. In this sample, patients with ruptured AAA were more likely to have larger aneurysms with shorter and narrower proximal necks. Significantly more intact aneurysms were morphologically suitable for endovascular repair compared with ruptured AAA (78% vs 43%; P <.001).\nRuptured AAA are less likely to be suitable for endovascular repair than are intact AAA, most probably because of larger diameter at presentation. Open repair will likely remain the treatment of choice in most patients with ruptured AAA, because of current morphologic constraints of endovascular repair.",

    "abstract": "Use of percutaneous suture closure devices after catheter-based interventions is increasing. We recently have seen several severe femoral arterial wall infections after use of such devices. The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence, comorbid associations, and management of femoral arterial infections associated with percutaneous suture closure devices.\nWe retrospectively reviewed all infectious complications that occurred after 2223 consecutive cardiac catheterization procedures performed over 12 months in a university-affiliated community teaching hospital. Outcome variables included demographics, procedural details, infection, type of arterial reconstruction required, mortality, and limb loss.\nDuring this study, 822 patients received percutaneous suture devices. Infection developed in 6 patients (0.7%). The incidence of diabetes in the population undergoing percutaneous suture closure was 219 of 822 patients (26.6%). Three comorbid conditions, noted in multiple patients with infectious complications, included diabetes mellitus, obesity, and placement of a percutaneous suture closure device within the past 6 months. Invasive femoral endarteritis developed in 4 patients. Gram-positive cocci predominated in 4 patients. In 1 patient with polymicrobial infection catastrophic complications developed, including multiple anastomotic ruptures and hemorrhage. A new method of repair that incorporated double-thickness everted saphenous vein was used in 2 patients, and safe arterial closure was achieved. There was 1 late fatality on postoperative day 36. Limb salvage was achieved in all patients.\nFemoral endarteritis complicating percutaneous suture closure is a challenging new problem for vascular surgeons and can result in catastrophic complications. Customary techniques that use saphenous vein patch or interposition grafting are not adequate in all circumstances. Successful outcome requires operative exploration in patients with suspected infection. Removal of the percutaneous suture closure device and debridement to normal arterial wall is recommended in all patients with suspected femoral endarteritis, based on positive intraoperative Gram stains or abnormal appearance of the adjacent femoral artery. Early success with an autologous bolstered repair is reported. Caution is advised when considering the use of a percutaneous suture closure device in patients with comorbid conditions including diabetes, obesity, and previously implanted devices.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate safety and cost benefits of the percutaneous technique for treatment of aortic aneurysm, a prospective randomized study was performed that compared the endovascular suture technique with conventional cutdown access and repair.\nFrom January 2002 through July 2002, 30 endografts, including 14 Talent stent-grafts (Medtronic, Sunrise, Fla) and 16 Zenith endografts (Cook, Bloomington, Ind) were implanted in 30 patients for endovascular aneurysm treatment. The patients were randomized to either percutaneous technique (group A) or conventional cutdown (group B). Fifty-five femoral arteries were cannulated with large-bore (14F-25F) introducers and were included in the study. Safety and efficiency of both techniques were assessed by recording the complication rates, operation time, discharge, and time to ambulation. Comparison of selected estimated costs included both variable and fixed costs for femoral access and expenses for treatment of complications.\nNo operative deaths occurred. The complication rates were similar and included 1 arterial thrombosis in each group, 3 lymphoceles in group B, and 1 conversion to cutdown because of bleeding in group A. Mean surgery time (86.7 +/- 27 minutes vs 107.8 +/- 38.5 minutes; P <.05) and time to ambulation (20.1 +/- 4.3 hours vs 33.1 +/- 18.4 hours; P <.001) were significantly shorter in the group treated percutaneously. Because of the cost of the closure device, total cost of the percutaneous technique averaged 99.2 euro; more than cutdown.\nThe percutaneous technique decreases the invasiveness of endovascular therapy of aortic aneurysm and reduces operative time and time to ambulation. Complications were roughly equivalent in severity. The additional cost for the device appears to justify its use for this form of aneurysm treatment.",

Men older than 50 years were screened for asymptomatic AAA. Outcome measures included cost per life-year saved and number of men needed to be screened to save one life.\nThe incidence of ruptured AAA was 2.6 per 10,000 person- years in the screening group and 7.1 per 10,000 person-years in the control group. Screening is estimated to have prevented 10.8 ruptured AAA and 8 deaths per year, gaining 51 life-years per year for the study population, and to have reduced the incidence of ruptured AAA by 64% (95% CI, 42%-77%). Each life-year gained during the first screening round cost $1107. To save one life, 1000 men need to be screened and 5 elective operations performed. We predict that a second round of screening can be cost neutral.\nThe cost-effectiveness of screening for AAA compares favorably with screening programs for other disorders in adults.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine the results of subfascial endoscopic perforator vein surgery (SEPS) combined with ablation of superficial venous reflux.\nClinical data were retrospectively analyzed for 74 consecutive limbs (65 patients) in which this combination treatment was performed at a university medical center. Preoperatively, 58 lower extremities had an open venous ulcer (CEAP clinical class 6 [C(6)]) and 16 had healed ulceration (C(5)). Preoperative and postoperative ulcer care remained constant. Main outcomes measured included perioperative complications, ulcer healing, and ulcer recurrence. Clinical severity and disability scores were tabulated before and after surgery. Mean patient follow-up was 44 months.\nGreater saphenous vein (GSV) stripping and varicose vein excision accompanied SEPS in 57 limbs (77%), and SEPS was performed alone or with varicose vein excision in 17 limbs that had previously undergone GSV stripping. Postoperative complications occurred in 12 limbs (16%), all with C(6) disease (P =.04). Ulcer healing occurred in 91% (53 of 58) of limbs with C(6) disease at a mean of 2.9 months (range, 13 days-17 months). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that ulcer healing was negatively affected by previous limb trauma (P =.011). Ulceration recurred in 4 limbs (6%) at 7, 20, 21, and 30 months, respectively. This was associated with a history of limb trauma (P =.027) and preoperative ultrasound evidence of GSV reflux combined with deep venous obstruction (P(R,O); P =.043). Clinical severity and disability scores improved significantly after surgery (both, P <.0001).\nMost venous ulcers treated with SEPS with ablation of superficial venous reflux heal rapidly and remain healed during medium-term follow-up. Ulcer healing is adversely affected by a history of severe limb trauma, and ulcer recurrence is similarly affected by a history of limb trauma in addition to superficial venous reflux combined with deep venous obstructive disease. Overall, there was marked improvement of postoperative clinical severity and disability scores compared with those obtained before surgery.",

Increase in aneurysm diameter and perigraft findings on contrast material-enhanced computed tomography scans prompted arteriography. Procedures were performed solely by vascular surgeons in a surgical angiography suite. In 7 patients aneurysm access was via the iliolumbar branches of the internal iliac artery, and in 1 patient aneurysm access was via the inferior mesenteric artery through the arc of Riolan from the superior mesenteric artery. Coaxial catheters were placed to gain access to the aneurysm (8F to 5F to 3F, or 5F to 3F). A 3F Tracker18 was the most distal catheter through which an assortment of 0.018 microcoils were deployed within the aneurysm, and the origin of the feeding vessels when possible.\nAneurysm diameter increased 0.48 +/- 0.2 cm over 10.8 +/- 5 months before superselective coil embolization. In 6 of 8 patients superselective coil embolization embolization resulted in a mean decrease in aneurysm diameter of 1.3 +/- 1.2 cm over 9 +/- 3.2 months. Failure was presumed due to inability to reach the aneurysm sac in 1 patient and was associated with oral anticoagulation in 1 other patient.\nProper identification of the source of type II endoleak and its complete occlusion, combined with aneurysm sac coiling, may result in prompt decrease in aneurysm size.",

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair have a high incidence of coexisting cardiac disease. The traditional cardiac risk stratification for open abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery may not apply to patients undergoing endoluminal graft exclusion. The purpose of this study was to examine predictive risk factors for perioperative cardiac events.\nAs part of multiple prospective endograft trials approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, data for 365 patients who underwent endoluminal graft repair from 1996 to 2001 were collected. Variables included for analysis were age and sex; history of smoking; presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or renal insufficiency; Eagle clinical cardiac risk factors; American Society of Anesthesiologists index; type of anesthesia administered; estimated blood loss; preoperative hemoglobin level; preoperative use of beta-blocker therapy; duration of surgery; need for iliac artery conduit; and concomitant other vascular procedures. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to determine which variables were predictive of an adverse perioperative cardiac event, eg, Q wave and non-Q wave myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF), severe arrhythmia, and unstable angina.\nThe study cohort included 322 men and 43 women (mean age, 74.2 years). Fifty-two (14.2%) postoperative cardiac events occurred: severe dysrhythmia in 15 patients (4.1%), MI in 14 patients (3.8%), non-Q wave MI in 8 patients (2.2%), CHF in 8 patients (2.2%), and unstable angina in 7 patients (1.9%). Univariate analysis demonstrated that age 70 years or older (P =.034), history of MI (P =.018), angina (P =.004), history of CHF (P <.001), two or more Eagle risk factors (P <.001), and lack of use of preoperative beta-blocker therapy (P =.005) were predictors of perioperative cardiac events. Multivariate analysis identified only age 70 years or older (P =.026), history of MI (P =.024) or CHF (P =.001), and lack of use of preoperative beta-blocker therapy (P =.007) as independent risk factors for an adverse cardiac event.\nAge 70 years or older, history of MI or CHF, and lack of use of preoperative beta-blocker therapy are independent risk factors for perioperative cardiac events in patients undergoing endoluminal graft repair.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to compare 1-year and 5-year results of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with the Guidant/EVT bifurcated graft system with results of open repair.\nThis was a prospective, nonrandomized, concurrent controlled study that compared results of endovascular versus open repair of AAA. The Phase II study with the EGS delivery system included 268 patients in 18 US medical centers; and the Phase III trial with the Ancure delivery system incuded 305 patients in 21 US institutions. Data were internally and externally audited and subjected to periodic review by the US Food and Drug Administration. The control group of 111 patients were excluded from endovascular repair with a tube graft because of anatomic considerations, but were otherwise comparable to the experimental group. Patients in the control group underwent conventional open surgical repair concurrently with patients who underwent EGS repair in 18 US institutions.\nFive hundred thirty-one of 573 patients (92.7%) underwent successful implantation of the Guidant/EVT bifurcated endograft. The combined major morbidity and mortality in the endograft group was 28.8%, compared with 44.1% in the open control group. Additional benefits in the endograft group included shorter hospital stay (2 days vs 6 days), less surgical blood loss (400 mL vs 800 mL), and less intensive care unit use (33% vs 94%). These early results are reported on an intent-to-treat basis; in all patients an attempt was made to treat with the endovascular graft, including those patients in whom conversion to standard open repair was necessary during the primary procedure. Three hundred nineteen patients were selected for long-term follow-up to 5 years, on the basis of date of implantation; ie, patients with the earliest implantations were followed up for 5 years. The primary purpose of long-term follow-up was to obtain data on long-term efficacy of the graft; thus only patients in whom implantation was successful were selected. No patient has experienced an aneurysm rupture to date. Survival (Kaplan- Meier method) in the experimental group was 68.1%, compared with 77.2% in the control group (P = NS). At 60 months, 74.4% of patients (32 of 43) were free of endoleak. There were no type I or type III endoleaks remaining. Aneurysm sac diameter decreased or remained stable in 97.6% of patients (41 of 42) and increased in only 1 patient. During the course of long-term follow-up, post-procedural conversion to open repair was required in only 9 patients (2.8%).\nThe EVT/Guidant bifurcated graft is effective in preventing AAA rupture, and long-term survival is comparable to that with open repair.",

    "abstract": "Non-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) carotid imaging with the time-of-flight (TOF) technique compares favorably with angiography, ultrasound, and excised plaques. However, gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) has almost universally replaced TOF-MRA, because it reduces imaging time (25 seconds vs 10 minutes) and improves signal-to-noise ratio. In our practice we found alarming discrepancies between CE-MRA and TOF-MRA, which was the impetus for this study.Study design To compare the two techniques, we measured stenosis, demonstrated on three-dimensional images obtained at TOF and CE-MRA, in 107 carotid arteries in 58 male patients. The measurements were made on a Cemax workstation equipped with enlargement and measurement tools. Measurements to 0.1 mm were made at 90 degrees to the flow channel at the area of maximal stenosis and distal to the bulb where the borders of the internal carotid artery lumen were judged to be parallel (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria). Experiments with carotid phantoms were done to test the contribution of imaging software to image quality.\nTwelve arteries were occluded. In the remaining 95 arteries, compared with TOF-MRA, CE-MRA demonstrated a greater degree of stenosis in 42 arteries, a lesser degree of stenosis in 14 arteries, and similar (+/-5%) stenosis in 39 arteries (P =.02, chi(2) analysis). The largest discrepancies were arteries with 0% to 70% stenosis. In those arteries in which CE-MRA identified a greater degree of stenosis than shown with TOF-MRA, mean increase was 21% for 0% to 29% stenosis, 36% for 30% to 49% stenosis, and 38% for of 50% to 69% stenosis. The carotid phantom experiments showed that the imaging parameters of CE-MRA, particularly the plane on which frequency encoding gradients were applied, reduced signal acquisition at the area of stenosis.\nCollectively these data demonstrate that CE-MRA parameters must be retooled if the method is to be considered reliable for determination of severity of carotid artery stenosis. CE-MRA is an excellent screening technique, but only TOF-MRA should be used to determine degree of carotid artery stenosis.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the technical success, safety, and short-term effectiveness of percutaneous intentional extraluminal recanalization (PIER) in patients with limb-threatening ischemia and no autologous vein or with a major contraindication to surgery.\nFrom 1999 through 2002, 25 patients with femoropopliteal occlusion and rest pain or tissue loss underwent PIER. Thirteen patients had undergone one or more failed bypass surgeries in the treated lower extremity, and no patient had suitable vein for bypass grafting. In four patients the ejection fraction was less than 15%; four patients had severe nonreconstructable coronary artery disease; and two patients with metastatic cancer refused amputation. All patients underwent subintimal wire placement, followed by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and intracoil stent placement. Occlusions ranged in length from 6 to 18 cm, and 1 to 10 stents were placed. Technical success required no residual stenosis greater than 30% on arteriography, velocity ratio less than 1.5 on duplex ultrasound scanning, and improvement in ankle-brachial index of 0.15 or greater. Follow-up duplex scanning was performed every 3 months.\nInitial success was obtained in 23 of 25 patients (92%), with ankle-brachial index improvement of.31 to.54. All successful procedures resulted in symptomatic improvement. Mean follow-up was 13.3 months (range, 4-30 months). During follow-up, 10 patients died and 2 arteries demonstrated recurrent occlusion. With life table analysis, success rate was 92% at 12 months. Of the 4 patients in whom the procedure failed, 3 required major amputation and symptoms persisted in one. Complications occurred after two procedures, one myocardial infarction and one groin hematoma.\nPIER is technically possible in patients with femoropopliteal occlusion, and the procedure is associated with a low complication rate. Most procedures provide at least short-term clinical success and have enabled successful wound healing and pain relief in patients without other effective options. Further studies and longer follow-up are required to determine long-term success and the role of PIER in treatment of femoropopliteal occlusion.",

    "abstract": "Many lower extremity vein graft procedures require revision. Although morbidity associated with revision procedures is assumed minimal, this has not been previously quantified and may be underestimated. In this study, patient outcome after initial vein graft procedures and revisions are compared.\nRecords for all patients undergoing vein graft revision from January 1995 to August 2002 were reviewed for operation time, estimated blood loss, blood transfusion, hospital length of stay, perioperative complications, and functional status at discharge and at 2-month follow-up. Revisions were compared with the original operation and by revision type.\nOne hundred sixty-five vein graft revisions were performed in 137 patients. In comparison with the initial bypass procedure, mean operation time (3.35 +/- 1.41 hours vs 2.58 +/- 1.04 hours; P <.001), estimated blood loss (272.4 +/- 249.9 mL vs 174.8 +/- 140.8 mL; P <.001), hospital length of stay (10.15 +/- 4.85 days vs 7.05 +/- 5.14; P <.001), and overall complication rate (35.8% vs 22.4%; P =.015) were significantly less for revision procedures. Revision of more than one site on the graft resulted in longer operation time (P =.003) and estimated blood loss (P <.001), but similar complication rates (P = NS), compared with revision at only one site. Revisions that involved only the graft resulted in decreased hospital length of stay compared with revisions involving extension to native inflow or outflow vessels (P <.02). Return to preoperative ambulatory status at discharge was 71% after initial operation, and was 92% after revision (P <.001). Return to independent living at discharge was 66% after the initial operation, and was 80% after revision (P <.01).\nOperative revisions were better tolerated than initial vein graft procedures, but are still major procedures. Hospital length of stay is longer for patients undergoing proximal or distal extension of the graft to native vessels and in patients who are not ambulatory and living independently at discharge. Patients undergoing vein graft revision should be counseled about potential morbidity.",

In comparison with the initial bypass procedure, mean operation time (3.35 +/- 1.41 hours vs 2.58 +/- 1.04 hours; P <.001), estimated blood loss (272.4 +/- 249.9 mL vs 174.8 +/- 140.8 mL; P <.001), hospital length of stay (10.15 +/- 4.85 days vs 7.05 +/- 5.14; P <.001), and overall complication rate (35.8% vs 22.4%; P =.015) were significantly less for revision procedures. Revision of more than one site on the graft resulted in longer operation time (P =.003) and estimated blood loss (P <.001), but similar complication rates (P = NS), compared with revision at only one site. Revisions that involved only the graft resulted in decreased hospital length of stay compared with revisions involving extension to native inflow or outflow vessels (P <.02). Return to preoperative ambulatory status at discharge was 71% after initial operation, and was 92% after revision (P <.001). Return to independent living at discharge was 66% after the initial operation, and was 80% after revision (P <.01).",

    "abstract": "Cryopreserved saphenous vein allografts (Cryograft; CryoLife, Kennesaw, Ga) have been used as conduit in infrainguinal revascularization when autogenous vein is inadequate or unavailable. Although some studies of Cryografts report poor long-term patency, an anticoagulation protocol may improve outcome. We evaluated our experience with Cryografts to further define their role in lower extremity revascularization. Patients and methods Between March 1992 and March 2002, 240 infrainguinal revascularization procedures with Cryografts were performed in 199 limbs of 177 patients. Eighty-nine percent of procedures were performed because of ischemic rest pain or tissue loss, and 75% of vein grafts were implanted into infrapopliteal targets. Most patients received anticoagulation therapy with warfarin sodium or aspirin, or both, postoperatively. Mean age of the cohort was 78 years; 61% were women; 75% had hypertension, 58% had diabetes, and 38% had renal dysfunction; and 47% were current or past smokers.\nMean follow-up was 7 months (range, 0-48 months). Primary patency rate was 83% at 1 month, 50% at 6 months, 30% at 12 months, and 18% at 24 months. Diabetes adversely affected graft patency. Warfarin sodium or antiplatelet therapy did not significantly improve graft patency. Limb salvage was 80% at 1 year and 71% at 2 years.\nCryografts have low primary patency rates that are not affected by anticoagulation with warfarin sodium. Short-term patency of these grafts may be sufficient to heal ischemic wounds and thereby prevent limb loss. However, other less expensive alternatives, eg, prosthetic grafts with vein cuffs, are available and appear to have better patency. Accordingly, use of Cryografts should be limited to revascularization through infected fields in patients without autogenous conduit.",

    "abstract": "We undertook this study to document the functional natural history of patients undergoing major amputation in an academic vascular surgery and rehabilitation medicine practice.\nA retrospective review was conducted of consecutive patients undergoing major lower extremity amputation and rehabilitation in a university and Department of Veterans Affairs hospital. Main outcome variables included operative mortality, follow-up, survival, median time to incision healing, secondary operative procedures for wound management, and conversion from below-knee amputation (BKA) to above-knee amputation (AKA). For surviving patients, quality of life was determined by degree of ambulation, eg, outdoors, indoors only, or no ambulation; use of a prosthesis; and independence, eg, community housing or nursing facility.\nFrom August 1997 through March 2002, 154 patients (130 men; median age, 62 years) underwent 172 major amputations, 78 AKA and 94 BKA, because of either critical limb ischemia (87%) or diabetic neuropathy (13%). Thirty-day operative mortality was 10%. Mean follow-up was 14 months. Healing at 100 and 200 days, as determined with the Kaplan-Meier method, was 55% and 83%, respectively, for BKA, and 76% and 85%, respectively, for AKA. Twenty-three BKA and 16 AKA required additional operative revision, and 18 BKA ultimately were converted to AKA. Survival was 78% at 1 year and 55% at 3 years. Function in surviving patients at 10 and 17 months, respectively, was as follows: 21% and 29% of patients ambulated outdoors, 28% and 25% ambulated indoors only, and 51% and 46% of patients were nonambulatory; 32% and 42% of patients used prosthetic limbs; and 17% and 8% of patients who lived in the community before amputation required care in a nursing facility.\nWe were surprised to find that vascular patients in a contemporary setting who require major lower extremity amputation and rehabilitation often remain independent despite infrequent prosthesis use and outdoor ambulation. Although any hope for postoperative ambulation in this population requires salvaging the knee joint, because of the morbidity incurred in both wound healing and rehabilitation efforts, aggressive effort should be reserved for selected patients at good risk. Ability to predict ambulation after BKA in the vascular population is poor.",

    "abstract": "Because of reduced reimbursement and introduction of endovascular techniques into practice, vascular surgeons have increased clinical commitments. Therefore we hypothesized that the scholarly productivity of vascular surgeons has decreased. Study design An author-based Medline search was carried out for members of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS). The search included the period from 1985 to 1989 (era 1) for members in 1990, and from 1995 to 1999 (era 2) for members in 2000. Citations were assigned a type: basic science, clinical, case report, letter, or other; and a topic: cardiac, vascular, endovascular, transplantation, or miscellaneous. The main outcome measures were the proportion of members who published in each era and the rates of publication among authors.\nFor era 1, 7069 citations were identified for 529 members, and for era 2, 6823 citations were identified for 615 members. Four hundred forty-two members were cited in era 1 (84%), compared with 443 (72%) in era 2 (P =.01). A significantly smaller proportion of members published clinical research, case reports, and other publications, but not basic science or letters. Excluding unpublished members, there was a median of 11 total publications per author in each era. There were significant reductions in the proportion of members publishing papers related to cardiac (from 36% to 21%), transplantation (8% to 4%), and miscellaneous (43% to 31%) topics, and a significant increase in papers related to endovascular topics (from 19% to 28%) from era 1 to era 2. Moreover, there was a significant increase in median number of vascular (from 5 to 8) and endovascular (1 to 2) papers per published member. Further, the proportion of vascular and endovascular citations compared with total citations increased from 44% to 56% in era 1 and from 3% to 10% in era 2. On a yearly basis, there was a steady decrease in the number of citations throughout era 2, whereas the number of citations in era 1 was relatively constant.\nAcademic productivity was maintained for individual members who published across both eras, but a smaller proportion of the SVS membership published in era 2. There was also a progressive reduction in the number of publications during the 1990s.",

    "abstract": "Complications of endovascular aneurysm repair can be difficult to manage. One of the more difficult situations is conversion to open surgery because of a failed endograft. We describe a technique for conversion that allows the proximal attachment system to remain intact. It may also enable infrarenal clamping of the aorta during the operation. The anastomosis is performed by incorporating the proximal attachment system of the endograft. This technique simplifies both vascular control of the aorta and the necessary reconstruction during creation of the proximal anastomosis. We believe this technique has important advantages when conversion of a failed endograft is required.",

    "abstract": "Penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (PAU) is an ulceration of an atherosclerotic plaque penetrating through the intima, which may lead to intramural hematoma, aneurysm formation, or rupture. This disease is predominantly found in the thoracic aorta and is uncommon in the infrarenal aorta. The effectiveness of endovascular repair of PAU in the infrarenal aorta was retrospectively investigated.\nFrom 1999 to 2002, PAU was diagnosed with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the abdominal aorta in four patients. All patients were men; their average age was 78 years. All four patients had hypertension, and two patients had concomitant coronary artery disease. Three patients had abdominal pain or lumbago.\nAll patients underwent endovascular grafting with a Gianturco Z-stent covered with thin-wall woven Dacron graft. Indications for endovascular intervention were aneurysm formation with or without intramural hematoma in two patients and contained rupture with extraaortic hematoma in two patients. The postoperative course was uneventful in all cases, and no endoleak or aneurysm expansion was recognized during follow-up (4-32 months; average, 14 months).\nInfrarenal aortic lesions caused by PAU were generally localized, and endovascular grafting appears to be a feasible alternative to surgical repair.",

    "abstract": "We undertook this study to evaluate in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) the relationship of endothelial dysfunction, which is directly related to progression and clinical complications of atherosclerosis, with variables including classic risk factors, inflammation, severity of peripheral circulatory impairment, and atherosclerotic burden.\nThis cross-sectional study included outpatients seen in an academic angiologic unit. Eighty-eight consecutive patients with PAD (ankle/brachial index [ABI] < 0.90) were studied. The control group consisted of 30 age-matched and sex-matched healthy subjects. Main outcome measures were endothelial function in the form of brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen, severity of PAD according to ABI, and atherosclerotic burden, ie, atherosclerosis in one leg or in two or more other sites.\nCompared with patients with FMD greater than 6.2% (ie, 5th percentile of FMD in control subjects), patients with FMD less than 6.2% had a similar prevalence of classic risk factors but higher median levels of CRP (1.6 vs 6.0 mg/L; P <.01) and fibrinogen (200 vs 374 mg/dL; P <.01). The two inflammatory markers were negatively correlated with FMD (P <.01). ABI was higher in patients with FMD greater than 6.2% than in those with worse endothelial function (0.72 +/- 0.15 vs 0.62 +/- 16; P <.01); there was no difference with respect to atherosclerotic burden. Multivariate analysis showed that the association of CRP, fibrinogen, and ABI with FMD less than 6.2% was unrelated to classic risk factors. In a second model, which included CRP, fibrinogen, and ABI, all three variables were independently related to FMD less than 6.2%.\nInflammation and severity of circulatory impairment are implicated in the pathophysiology of dysfunctional endothelium in PAD.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to investigate whether infection of a vascular graft with Staphylococcus aureus can be treated in situ by applying antibiotic-loaded porous apatite ceramic, in a rabbit model.\nTeicoplanin (TEIC) was loaded onto a beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) block, a type of porous apatite ceramic. The activity of TEIC released from the antibiotic-loaded TCP block was examined in vivo. A vascular graft was patched onto the abdominal aorta in 24 rabbits, and S aureus was applied directly on it. Seven days postoperatively, each rabbit underwent repeat laparotomy, and retroperitoneal abscess around the prosthetic vascular patch was debrided. Animals were divided into four groups of 6 rabbits each. In group 1 only debridement was carried out. In groups 2 and 3, solution containing 40 or 60 mg of TEIC, respectively, was applied to the prosthetic vascular patch. In group 4, an antibiotic-loaded TCP block (63 +/- 6.6 mg of TEIC) was placed around the graft. Three weeks after the second operation, the graft, the tissue around it, and arterial blood were collected and cultured.\nTEIC activity was maintained for 28 days in vivo. In group 1, bacterial cultures of the prosthetic vascular graft and the tissue around it were positive in 5 animals and negative in 1 animal (infection rate, 83%). In both groups 2 and 3, cultures were positive in 3 animals and negative in 3 animals (infection rate, 50%). In group 4, cultures were negative in all animals (infection rate, 0%). Blood cultures were negative in all animals. Infection rate in group 4 was significantly lower than that in group 1 (P =.03), and was also lower than that in groups 2 and 3, but the difference was not significant.\nUse of slow-release antibiotic loaded onto a TCP block, along with debridement, may control infection in vascular grafts in situ, averting the necessity to remove the graft.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO), catalyzed by inducible NO synthase (iNOS), may be important in the pathophysiologic characteristics of many vascular diseases. Although there is indirect evidence to support the presence of iNOS in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in human beings, no definitive study has confirm this finding. The present study was designed to assess expression of iNOS in AAA in human beings. Furthermore, the activity of iNOS and the oxidative vascular injury initiated by iNOS were assessed with detection of nitrotyrosine, which is a marker indicative of formation and activity of the NO-derived oxidant peroxynitrite.\nWe studied 25 patients with AAA and 10 patients with normal abdominal aortas. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used in tissue sections to localize iNOS messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein. Double staining with a combination of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry was used to simultaneously demonstrate iNOS mRNA expression and its cellular localization. The presence of peroxynitrite was indirectly assessed with immunostaining with anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies.\nIn situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of iNOS in media and adventitia of AAA in all 25 patients. Specific cell markers identified iNOS mRNA-positive cells mainly as T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells. Positive immunostaining for nitrotyrosine was present in macrophages and smooth muscle cells. Normal abdominal aorta demonstrated virtually no iNOS or nitrotyrosine expression.\nStimulated expression of iNOS is associated with degeneration of AAA in human beings, and the activity of this enzyme under such conditions preferentially promotes formation and activity of peroxynitrite and further contributes to oxidative tissue and cellular injury in AAA. This may be important in the pathogenesis of AAA.",

    "abstract": "We retrospectively assessed computed tomography (CT) scans to determine degree of anterolateral abdominal muscle atrophy in patients who underwent infrarenal aortic repair with 2 kinds of incisions for the extraperitoneal approach.\nCT scans obtained before surgery and final scans obtained 2 to 100 months after surgery were assessed in 12 patients with paramedian incision (PM group) and 27 patients with flank incision (F group) who could be followed up at our hospital. We considered muscle thickness before surgery on the incision side to be 100% thickness (baseline value), and we calculated, by measuring the incision side after surgery, the corrected percent thickness (CPT%), which represents percentage of remaining muscle thickness that has escaped incision-induced atrophy. CT scans obtained at the level of the third (L3) and fifth (L5) lumbar vertebrae and the center of the sacrum (S) were selected for CPT% measurement.\nDuration from surgery to final CT scan was 2 to 65 months (mean +/- SD, 34.33 +/- 21.38 months) in PM group and 3 to 96 months (27.85 +/- 20.74 months) in F group. In PM group, mean CPT% values of the rectus abdominis muscle were 55.83 +/- 21.65% at L3, 35.50 +/- 10.79% at L5, and 31.92 +/- 11.00% at S; these values were statistically much smaller than baseline (P <.01). Mean CPT% values of the lateral abdominal muscles were not statistically different from baseline. In F group, mean CPT% values of the rectus abdominis muscle were 82.19 +/- 23.15% at L5 and 64.41 +/- 31.34% at S; these values were statistically smaller than baseline (P <.01). Mean CPT% values of the lateral abdominal muscles were 87.59 +/- 22.30% at L3 and 84.59 +/- 26.90% at L5; these values were statistically smaller than baseline (P <.05).\nParamedian incision induced severe rectus abdominis muscle atrophy. Although flank incision induced various degrees of atrophy in both muscles, some patients had no muscle atrophy. These data indicate that further anatomic investigation into the relation between flank incision and abdominal wall innervation may contribute to prevention of muscle atrophy after flank incision.",

We attempted to identify risk factors that predict prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS) so that realistic expectations can be established for these patients who frequently are at high-risk.\nIn 1994 a clinical pathway for aortic surgery was implemented at our hospital. Between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 2000, data including identifiable risk factors and LOS were reviewed for 240 patients who underwent elective infrarenal aortic surgery to treat aneurysmal (n = 179) or occlusive (n = 61) disease. Risk factors were analyzed to determine their effect on LOS. Data for patients who underwent endovascular, emergency, or concomitant cardiac surgery were excluded from analysis.\nIn-hospital mortality was 0.4% (1 of 240 patients), and morbidity was 18% (44 of 240 patients). Mean LOS was 8.2 +/- 5.7 days for all patients, 6.9 +/- 2.9 days for those without complications, and 13.8 +/- 6.7 days for patients with complications (P <.0001). Factors that predicted prolonged LOS (Kaplan-Meier method) included age older than 75 years (P =.0004), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; P =.0351), intraoperative blood loss more than 500 mL (P =.0006), duration of surgery more than 5 hours (P <.0001), wound infection (P =.0311), and postoperative complications overall (P <.0001). Remaining factors associated with prolonged LOS (Cox regression analysis) included age older than 75 years (P =.0050), COPD (P =.0445), and complications overall (P =.0094).\nThe only identifiable preoperative risk factors that correlated with increasing LOS after elective infrarenal aortic surgery (multivariate analysis) were increasing age and COPD. Third-party payers should allow longer hospitalization for patients older than 75 years and for patients with significant pulmonary disease.",

Further insight into the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysm might be obtained by comparing its association with smoking with that of other smoking-related diseases.\nWe conducted a systematic review of studies providing relative risk associated with smoking for both aortic aneurysm and other smoking-related diseases.\nWe identified 10 eligible studies, which included more than 3 million subjects. The events reported in 9 studies were death from target diseases; the tenth study reported new diagnoses. Relative risk for aortic aneurysm-related events in current smokers was generally 3 to 6, compared with 1 to 2 for coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular disease and 5 to 12 for COPD. For each category of smoking in each study, relative risk associated with smoking was substantially greater for aortic aneurysm than for coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular disease. Our pooled estimates indicate that, in men, the association of ever smoking with aortic aneurysm is 2.5 times greater than the association of ever smoking with coronary artery disease (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2, 2.8) and 3.5 times greater than the association of ever smoking with cerebrovascular disease (95% CI, 2.4, 5.3), but only 0.56 as great as the association of ever smoking with COPD (95% CI, 0.36, 0.86).\nThe difference in magnitude of these associations with smoking is consistent with a non-atherosclerotic cause for aortic aneurysm and/or a stronger effect of smoking on vascular disease in the peripheral arteries.",

    "abstract": "The feasibility of endovascular aneurysm repair depends on morphologic characteristics of the aortoiliac segment. Knowledge of such characteristics is relevant to safe deployment of a particular device in a single patient and to development of new devices for use in patients with a broader spectrum of anatomic variations.\nWe evaluated findings on computed tomography scans for 277 patients being considered for endovascular aneurysm repair. Aortic neck length and angulation estimates were generated with three-dimensional trigonometry. Specific centerline points were recorded, corresponding to the aorta at the celiac axis, lowest renal artery, cranial aspect of the aneurysm sac, aortic terminus, right hypogastric artery origin, and left hypogastric origin. Aortic neck thrombus and calcium content were recorded, and neck conicity was calculated in degrees. Statistical analysis was performed with the Spearman rank correlation. Data are expressed as median and interquartile range.\nMedian diameter of the aneurysms was 52 mm (interquartile range, 48-59 mm) in minor axis and 56 mm (interquartile range, 51-64 mm) in major axis, and median length was 88 mm (interquartile range, 74-103 mm). Median proximal aortic neck diameter was 26 mm (interquartile range, 22-29 mm), and median neck length was 30 mm (interquartile range, 18-45 mm). The common iliac arteries were similar in diameter (right artery, 16 mm [interquartile range, 13-20 mm]; left artery, 15 mm [interquartile range, 11-18 mm]) and length (right, 59 mm [interquartile range, 50-69 mm]; left, 60 mm [interquartile range, 49-70 mm]). Median angulation of the infrarenal aortic neck was 40 degrees (interquartile range, 29-51 degrees), and median angulation of the suprarenal segment was 45 degrees (interquartile range, 36-57 degrees). By gender, sac diameter, proximal neck diameter, and iliac artery diameter were significantly larger in men. Significant linear associations were identified between sac diameter and sac length, neck angulation, and iliac artery diameter. As the length of the aneurysm sac increased the proximal aortic neck length decreased. Conversely, as the sac length decreased sac eccentricity increased. Mural thrombus content within the neck increased with increasing neck diameter.\nThere is considerable variability in aortoiliac morphologic parameters. Significant associations were found between various morphologic variables, links that are presumably related to a shared pathogenesis for aberration in aortoiliac diameter, length, and angulation. Ultimately this information can be used to develop new endovascular devices with broader applicability and improved long-term results.",

    "abstract": "Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) rupture usually results in death. The outcome remains poor for patients who reach the operating room. The objective of this investigation was to define contemporary surgical experience with ruptured TAAA in the United States. Patients and methods Clinical data derived from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample on patients who underwent repair of a ruptured TAAA from 1988 to 1998 were analyzed. Age, sex, race, nature of admission, comorbid conditions, and provider volume were abstracted from the database. In-hospital mortality, postoperative complications, and length of stay were the principal outcome measures.\nThree hundred twenty-one patients were identified for the study. Mean age was 71.5 years; men outnumbered women (63% vs 37%). Crude overall surgical mortality was 53.8% and did not improve over time. Operative mortality was most likely (51%) to occur within the first 24 hours postoperatively. Median length of stay for surviving patients was 16 days. Renal failure (28%) and cardiac complications (18%) were the most common complications. In a logistic regression model, age greater than 77 years was predictive of death (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; P =.005), and nonwhite race appeared protective (OR, 0.53; P =.013).\nMortality after surgical treatment of ruptured TAAA is high. Surviving patients experience many postoperative complications and have lengthy hospital stays. Given the lack of significant improvement in contemporary surgical practice, new techniques of repair deserve the attention of clinicians.",

    "abstract": "To prevent iodinated contrast medium-induced nephrotoxicity, gadolinium has been used increasingly for magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to visualize arterial anatomy in patients undergoing vascular surgery who are considered at high risk because of chronic renal insufficiency. We assessed the safety of gadolinium-based contrast medium as a substitute for iodinated contrast medium-enhanced examinations. We determined the incidence of gadolinium-induced nephrotoxicity in a clinical setting and searched for contributing risk factors. Patients and methods In a single-center retrospective study from December 1999 to January 2001, 218 inpatients underwent MRA and 42 inpatients underwent DSA, with gadolinium as the sole contrast agent. Patient comorbid conditions, indications for vascular imaging, contrast dose, urine output, baseline and post-procedure serum creatinine concentration (SCr), and outcome were recorded for all patients in whom gadolinium-induced renal failure developed.\nOf 260 patients who received gadolinium-based contrast agents, at a dose of 0.25 mmol/kg or more, 195 patients (75%) had pre-test baseline chronic renal insufficiency. In 7 of 195 patients (3.5%) acute renal failure developed after gadolinium-based contrast medium administration, for MRA (n = 153) in 3 patients (1.9%) and DSA (n = 42) in 4 patients (9.5%). Average baseline SCr in the 195 patients with chronic renal insufficiency was 38.2 +/- 1.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and in the 7 patients in whom acute renal failure developed, baseline SCr was 32.5 +/- 7.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (P =.33). Respective intravenous and intra-arterial gadolinium doses in these 7 patients ranged from 0.31 to 0.41 mmol/kg for MRA and 0.27 to 0.42 mmol/kg for DSA. Acute renal failure did not develop in any of 65 patients with normal baseline SCr.\nDespite reports of negligible nephrotoxicity, rarely gadolinium-based contrast agents can cause acute renal failure in patients with underlying chronic renal insufficiency. Estimation of creatinine clearance alone does not enable prediction of which patients are likely to have acute renal failure. Patients at high-risk should be identified, and prophylactic measures should be taken to reduce the risk for nephrotoxicity.",

After 3 months, grafts were explanted in 5 dogs (control grafts), and the remaining 20 dogs underwent femoral artery ligation to create a thrombosed graft. Of the 20 grafts, 5 were explanted at 3 days after ligation (group I-3) and 5 were explanted at 5 days after ligation (group I-5). Of the remaining 10 grafts, 5 underwent thrombectomy at 3 days after ligation (group II-3) and 5 underwent thrombectomy at 5 days after ligation, and were reimplanted into the left femoral artery, then explanted 28 days after reimplantation. The grafts were assessed with immunohistochemistry and prostaglandin (PG) I(2) assay (6-keto-PGI(1alpha)).\nOf the 25 grafts, occlusion recurred in 3 in group II-5 within 28 days after reimplantation. There were significant differences between group I-5 and group I-3 or control grafts for percentage of areas positive for alpha-actin, total number of cells per field, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells in layer of thickened intima and atrophied media (I/M), and for total cell and PCNA- positive cell numbers per field in the adventitia.

    "abstract": "Intermittent claudication resulting from peripheral arterial disease (PAD) can substantially impair walking function. The Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) assesses patient self-reported difficulty in walking. Currently this questionnaire is validated for interviewer administration only. Since this can be burdensome in a large clinical trial, we examined the effects of alternative methods of administration on patient responses on the WIQ.\nThe WIQ, which consists of four subscales (pain severity, distance, speed, stairs), was modified to be self-administered or interviewer-administered by telephone. Patients with PAD were recruited from two sites and randomized into two groups: in group 1 the WIQ was self-administered, then telephone-administered; in group 2 the WIQ was telephone-administered, then self-administered. The two administrations occurred 4 to 7 days apart. Additional measures (SF-36, EQ-5D, and PAD symptom scale) and clinical data were included to further assess the validity of the WIQ and symptoms in patients with claudication. Telephone interviews were conducted by trained interviewers using standardized scripts. Two-week test-retest reliability was assessed for both the self-administered WIQ (group 1) and the telephone-administered WIQ (group 2).\nSixty patients were recruited at two sites (n = 30 per group). Seventy-eight percent were men; mean patient age was 67.1 years; and 83% of patients were white. Mean duration of PAD symptoms was 6.8 years. No significant differences were observed in WIQ subscale scores between self administration and telephone administration.

We describe trends in use of interventional procedures to treat PAOD in Ontario over the past decade.\nA retrospective population-based cohort study was conducted for fiscal years 1991 to 1998 with Ontario administrative databases to identify all arterial bypass surgeries, angioplasty procedures, and amputations performed.\nA total of 19,332 bypass operations, 16,334 angioplasty procedures, and 17,534 amputations were identified. Population-based rates showed that angioplasty use peaked at about 110 per 100,000 at age 65 to 74 years, arterial bypass surgery use peaked at 129 per 100,000 at age 75 to 84 years, and amputation use peaked at 138 per 100,000 at age 85 years or older. All types of interventional procedures to treat PAOD were performed more frequently in men than in women. Age-adjusted and sex-adjusted rate of arterial bypass surgery decreased significantly, from 77 to 61 per 100,000 population aged 45 years or older (P =.0002, linear regression analysis), whereas rate for PTA increased significantly, from 59 to 75 per 100,000 population aged 45 years or older (P =.0005). The overall major amputation rate declined slightly over the study period, influenced by the decreased rate in patients aged 85 years or older. The revascularization rate in patients aged 85 years or older increased (P =.055).\nReduced use of arterial bypass surgery and increased use of angioplasty procedures has occurred over the past decade and may reflect a change in the practice pattern of vascular surgeons in Ontario, who have become more conservative in treating localized disease and reserve surgical interventions for more severe forms of PAOD. The slight reduction in overall major amputation rate, driven by decreased rate in patients aged 85 years or older, may reflect a trend toward a more aggressive revascularization approach in this age group.",

    "abstract": "The TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) document did not define the best treatment for moderately severe iliac artery lesions, ie, TASC type B and type C iliac lesions, because of insufficient solid evidence to make firm recommendations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of risk factors on outcome of iliac stenting and operative procedures used to treat TASC type B and type C lesions.\nOver the 5 years from 1996 to 2001, 188 endovascular and direct aortoiliac surgical reconstruction procedures were performed in 87 women and 101 men with TASC type B and type C iliac lesions and chronic limb ischemia. The criteria prepared by the Ad Hoc Committee on Reporting Standards (Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery (SVS/ISCVS) were followed to define variables. Both univariate analysis (Kaplan-Meier method) and multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards model) were used to determine the association between variables, cumulative patency rate, limb salvage, and survival.\nIndications for revascularization were disabling claudication (73%), limb salvage (25%), and blue toe syndrome (2%). Patients in the surgery group (n = 52) had significantly higher primary patency rates compared with patients in the stent group (n = 136) at univariate analysis (Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test; P =.015). Primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 85%, 72%, and 64% after iliac stenting, and 89%, 86%, and 86% after surgical reconstruction, respectively. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis enabled identification of poor runoff (ie, runoff score >5 for unilateral procedures or >2.5 for bilateral outflow procedures; relative risk, 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-4.2; P =.001) as the only independent predictor of decreased primary patency in all patients. However, stratified analysis including only patients with poor runoff revealed that patients undergoing iliac stenting had significantly lower primary patency rates compared with those undergoing surgical reconstruction (Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test; P =.05). External iliac artery disease and female gender were also identified as independent predictors of decreased primary stent patency.\nPoor infrainguinal runoff is the main risk factor for decreased primary patency after surgical reconstruction and iliac stenting to treat TASC type B and type C iliac lesions. However, primary patency is less affected by poor runoff in patients undergoing surgical procedures. The presence of poor runoff, external iliac artery disease, and female gender are independent predictors of poor outcome after iliac stenting, and therefore these risk factors should determine the need for surgical reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Patients with peripheral vascular disease have been excluded from initial studies of percutaneous suture-mediated closure devices (SMCD) despite representing a significant proportion of those requiring endovascular intervention. We sought to determine whether these devices could be safely used in patients with peripheral vascular disease.\nPatients were stratified into two groups and five subgroups on the basis of indication for arteriography, and they were prospectively randomized at the end of the procedure to receive either the SMCD or manual compression. Ankle-brachial index was determined and duplex ultrasound scanning of the accessed femoral artery was performed, before and after the procedure. Ultrasound data included peak systolic velocity, minimum intraluminal vessel diameter, and presence or absence of calcified plaque. Time to hemostasis, ambulation, and discharge were recorded, and major or minor complications were noted.\nOf 102 patients included in the study, 52 patients were randomized to receive the SMCD. There was no difference in ankle-brachial index, minimum intraluminal vessel diameter, or peak systolic velocity in the accessed vessel after closure with SMCD or manual compression. Time to hemostasis, ambulation, and discharge was significantly less in the SMCD group (P =.001). Presence of calcified plaque was not associated with complications (P =.146). In the SMCD group, hemostasis was achieved with 49 of 52 devices (94.2%). There were six complications (5.9%), two of which were major and required operative intervention. All complications were hemorrhagic and not occlusive. There was no difference in overall complication rate between SMCD (7.7%) and manual compression (4.0%) groups (P =.678). No infection was noted in any of the 102 patients.\nSuture-mediated percutaneous arterial closure can be safely performed in patients with peripheral vascular disease, even in the presence of calcified plaque. This closure technique enables shorter time to hemostasis, ambulation, and hospital discharge. There are observed differences in minor, but not major, complication rates for MC versus percutaneous arterial closure in patients with peripheral vascular disease, but these differences did not achieve statistical significance in this small series.",

    "abstract": "We undertook this study to determine factors that adversely affect outcome in patients with penetrating injury to the extracranial cerebral vasculature. Patients and methods Medical records were reviewed for all patients who had undergone surgical intervention to treat penetrating injury to the extracranial cerebral arteries between January 1989 and December 1999. Forensic autopsy findings were also reviewed for all patients who died as a result of their injury.\nOne hundred fifty-one patients with injury to the brachiocephalic artery (n = 21), common carotid artery (n = 98), or internal carotid artery (n = 32) were identified. Overall mortality was 21.2%, and stroke rate in surviving patients was 15.1%. Twenty-five of 32 deaths (78.1%) were stroke-related. Brachiocephalic artery injury was associated with the highest mortality (38.1%), and survivor stroke rate was highest in patients with internal carotid injuries (22.7%). Hemodynamic instability at presentation led to both higher mortality (30.7%) and stroke rate (19.2%). Preoperative angiography did not influence mortality or stroke rate in hemodynamically stable patients. Procedural mortality associated with arterial ligation was 45% (9 of 20 patients), and no surviving patient experienced a change in pre-ligation neurologic state. Nine patients remained neurologically intact after ligation, and 2 patients with preoperative localized neurologic deficit were unchanged postoperatively. In 131 patients, mortality after arterial repair was 17.6%, and in 5 surviving patients (5.4%) an ischemic neurologic deficit developed. Twelve of 15 surviving patients (80%) with preoperative neurologic deficit who underwent arterial repair had improved neurologic status. Cerebral infarcts were confirmed at autopsy in 23 patients; 18 infarcts were ischemic (10, repair; 8, ligation), and 5 infarcts were hemorrhagic (all, repair). No factor was identified that was predictive of ischemic versus hemorrhagic infarction in patients undergoing repair.\nThe presence of hypovolemic shock, internal carotid artery injury, complete vessel transection, and arterial ligation are associated with unfavorable outcome. Penetrating injury to the brachiocephalic, common carotid, or internal carotid artery should be repaired rather than ligated when technically possible. Subsequent ischemic or hemorrhagic cerebral infarction is unpredictable, but overall outcome is superior to that with ligation of the injured artery.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative infection is one of the most dreaded complications associated with use of synthetic patches for carotid endarterectomy. Although polyester patches were used extensively for carotid patch angioplasty throughout the last decade, few reports detail cases of deep patch infection. We describe our experience with polyester patch infections after carotid endarterectomy. Patients and methods From January 1996 through December 2001 we treated polyester patch infections after carotid endarterectomy in 10 patients.\nThe interval from primary carotid endarterectomy to presentation with infection ranged from 11 days to 30 months. All patients underwent repeat operation that involved tissue debridement, excision of the polyester patch, and either interposition grafting or patch angioplasty with autologous vein. No perioperative stroke or death occurred; however, 1 patient had transient hoarseness, and in 1 patient a pseudoaneurysm developed that required additional surgical repair with a saphenous vein interposition graft. All patients remain well and free of infection with follow-up as long as 56 months.\nInfection is a serious and rare complication of carotid patch angioplasty with polyester material. Nonetheless, it can be treated successfully with good results and acceptable morbidity with soft tissue debridement, prosthetic patch excision, and either patch angioplasty or interposition grafting with autologous vein.",

    "abstract": "Extracranial carotid stenosis is a complication of external head and neck irradiation. The safety and durability of carotid artery revascularization through a radiated field has been debated. We describe the immediate and long-term results in a series of 27 consecutive patients who received treatment over 12 years.\nFrom May 1990 to May 2002, 27 consecutive patients underwent 30 primary carotid artery revascularization procedures. All patients had received previous radiation therapy within a mean interval of 10 years (range, 1-26 years), with average radiation dose of 62 Gy (range, 50-70 Gy). Moderate to severe scarring of the skin or radiation fibrosis was present in three fourths of patients. Thirteen patients (48%) had undergone radical neck dissection, and 2 patients had a permanent tracheotomy. The indications for carotid surgery included high-grade (>70%) symptomatic stenosis in 18 patients (60%) and high-grade asymptomatic stenosis in 12 patients (40%). General anesthesia with systematic shunting was used in 18 patients (60%), and regional anesthesia with selective shunting was used in 12 patients (40%). Operations included standard carotid endarterectomy (n = 20), with patch angioplasty (n = 12) or direct closure (n = 8); carotid interposition bypass grafting (n = 7); and subclavian to carotid bypass grafting (n = 3). Primary closure of the surgical wound was performed in all procedures without any special muscular or skin flaps. All patients were followed up for a mean of 40 months (range, 3-99 months).\nThere was one (3.3%) perioperative death, from massive intracerebral hemorrhage; and 1 patient had a transient ischemic attack. In-hospital complications included neck hematoma in 2 patients, which required surgical drainage in 1 patient. There was neither delayed wound healing nor infection. Twelve patients died during follow-up, of causes not related to treatment. None of the surviving patients had further stroke, and all remained asymptomatic. Follow-up duplex scans showed asymptomatic recurrent stenosis greater than 60% in 3 patients, 2 of whom with stenosis greater than 80% underwent repeat operation. Risk for recurrent stenosis greater than 60% at 18 months was 16.6%. Recurrent stenosis occurred in 2 of these patients after saphenous vein bypass, and in 1 patient after endarterectomy with vein patch angioplasty.\nThe clinical results and sustained freedom from symptoms and stroke over 40-month follow-up suggests that carotid revascularization through a radiated field is a safe and durable procedure in patients at high surgical risk, despite a marked incidence of recurrent stenosis.",

However, many patients are completely independent on the evening of procedure. Therefore we sought to establish the safety and feasibility of same-day discharge by assessing frequency and time of complications in the first 30 days after CAS.\nCase records for 208 consecutive patients who had undergone CAS from October 1999 to October 2002 were retrospectively reviewed. Excluded were four cases in which combined CAS and carotid endarterectomy was performed to treat synchronous stenosis. Of the remaining 204 cases, involving 201 patients (three patients underwent staged bilateral CAS), 173 (84.8%) were symptomatic and 31 (15.2%) were asymptomatic.\nThirty-eight major events or death (inclusive of all neurologic events and any complications that required treatment) were recorded in the first 30 days after CAS, for an event rate of 18.6% per case. These were 7 (3.4%) major access site complications; 18 (8.8%) neurologic events, of which 10 (4.9%) were transient ischemic events and 8 (3.9%) were strokes (including minor, major, and fatal stroke); 8 (3.9%) cardiovascular complications; and five (2.5%) other events. Twenty (52.6%) events occurred in the first 6 hours after CAS, 2 (5.3%) between 6 and 12 hours, 3 (7.9%) between 12 and 24 hours, and 13 (34.2%) 24 hours to 30 days post procedure. Four (2.0%) deaths were recorded in this period, 1 secondary to stroke, 1 from a perforated myocardium from a temporary pacing wire, and 2 from unrelated causes. The 30-days stroke and death rate was 5.4% (11 of 204 patients).\nTime of complications suggests that outpatient performance of CAS is feasible and safe in selected patients.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent and compelling need to reduce the morbidity and expense of maintaining hemodialysis vascular access patency. This large, long-term, retrospective, multicenter study, which compared access patency of autogenous arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) and synthetic bridge grafts (AVG) created with conventional sutures or nonpenetrating clips, was undertaken to resolve conflicting results from previous smaller studies.\nPatency data for 1385 vascular access anastomoses (clipped or sutured) was obtained from 17 hospitals and dialysis centers (Appendix). Five hundred eighteen AVF (242 clip, 276 suture) and 827 AVG (440 clip, 384 suture) were analyzed. Statistical comparisons were made with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, log-rank test, two-sample t test, and X(2) test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to confirm Kaplan-Meier analysis.\nAccess patency (primary, secondary, overall, and intention to treat) was significantly improved in access anastomoses constructed with clips. In the intention-to-treat group, primary patency at 24 months was 0.54 for clipped AVF and 0.34 for sutured AVF, and was 0.36 for clipped AVG and 0.17 for sutured AVG. At 24 months, primary patency rate for AVF successfully used for dialysis was 0.67 for clips and 0.48 for sutures, and for AVG was 0.39 for clips and 0.19 for sutured constructs. Interventions necessary to maintain patency were significantly fewer in clipped anastomoses.\nReplacing conventional suture with clips significantly reduces morbidity associated with maintaining permanent hemodialysis vascular access. This beneficial effect may be due to the biologic superiority of interrupted, nonpenetrating vascular anastomoses.",

Interventions necessary to maintain patency were significantly fewer in clipped anastomoses.",

    "abstract": "We performed this observational study to validate the three components of a new venous severity scoring (VSS) system, ie, venous clinical severity score (VCSS), venous segmental disease score (VSDS), and venous disability score (VDS), and to evaluate VCSS, VDS, and CEAP clinical class and score in quantifying outcome of varicose vein surgery. Patients and methods The study included 45 patients who underwent superficial venous surgery in 48 legs with primary varicose veins. Venous color duplex scanning, clinical examination, and a questionnaire were used preoperatively and at 6 weeks and 6 months postoperatively to assign VSS and CEAP clinical class and score.\nCEAP clinical score, VCSS, and VDS demonstrated a linear association with CEAP clinical class (P <.001, P <.001, P =.002, respectively). Good correlation among all severity scores was found, particularly between CEAP clinical score and VCSS (r = 0.94; P <.001). CEAP clinical score was also highly correlated with CEAP clinical class (r = 0.84; P <.001) and VDS (r = 0.70; P <.001). Similarly, VCSS correlated with CEAP clinical class (r = 0.83; P <.001) and also VDS (r = 0.72; P <.001). The anatomic severity marker VSDS demonstrated a weak correlation with clinical severity indicators VCSS (r = 0.29; P =.048) and VDS (r = 0.31; P =.03) but not with age, gender, or CEAP clinical class and score. Six months after surgery the median (interquartile range) percent change in VCSS (73%; range, 50%-100%) and CEAP clinical score (70%; range, 50%-100%) were both significantly greater (P <.001) than the corresponding change in CEAP clinical class (17%; range, 0%-50%). In legs with high VDS at baseline, median (interquartile range) percent change in VDS was 100% (range, 50%-100%), significantly greater (P <.001) than the corresponding change in CEAP clinical class (0%; range, 0%-17%).\nVenous severity scores are significantly higher in advanced venous disease, demonstrating correlation with anatomic extent. Both venous clinical severity scores, VCSS and CEAP clinical score, are equally sensitive and significantly better for measuring changes in response to superficial venous surgery than is the already in use CEAP clinical class. VDS demonstrated comparable and even better performance. Although the assignment of CEAP clinical class might be adequate for daily clinical purposes, venous severity scoring systems should be used in clinical studies to quantify venous outcome.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of endovascular and open surgical reconstructions in patients with superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome caused by nonmalignant disease.\nClinical data from 32 consecutive patients who underwent endovascular or open surgical reconstruction of central veins because of symptomatic benign SVC syndrome between November 1983 and June 2001 were retrospectively reviewed.\nThe study included 17 male and 15 female patients (mean age, 38 years; range, 5-69 years). Presenting symptoms were head fullness (n = 26), dyspnea or orthopnea (n = 23), headache (n = 17), or dizziness (n = 11); physical signs were head swelling (n = 31), chest wall collateral vessels (n = 29), facial cyanosis (n = 18), or arm swelling (n = 17). Etiologic factors included mediastinal fibrosis (n = 19), indwelling catheter (n = 8), idiopathic thrombosis (n = 4), or post-surgery (n = 1). Two patients were heterozygous for factor V Leiden; 1 patient had antithrombin III deficiency. Twenty-nine patients underwent surgical reconstruction with 31 bypass grafts: spiral saphenous vein (n = 20), superficial femoral vein (n = 4), human allograft (n = 1), or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE, n = 6). Eleven patients underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or stenting; 3 primary and 8 secondary endovascular procedures were performed to treat graft stenosis (n = 7) or occlusion (n = 1). There were no early deaths. Five early graft failures in 3 ePTFE grafts and 2 bifurcated vein grafts (thrombosis, n = 4; stenosis, n = 1) were successfully treated with open surgical revision. Over a mean follow-up of 5.6 years (range, 0.4-16.6 years) in surgical patients, 17 additional secondary interventions were performed in 8 patients, 14 endovascular and 3 surgical. Primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates of surgical bypass grafts were 63%, 79%, and 85%, respectively, at 1 year, and 53%, 68%, and 80%, respectively, at 5 years. Graft patency was significantly higher in vein grafts compared with ePTFE grafts (P =.02). Mean follow-up after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or stenting was 3.1 years (range, 1 day-11.7 years). Twelve secondary endovascular interventions were performed in 6 patients (primary group, 3 of 3; secondary group, 3 of 9 grafts in 8 patients) to maintain patency in 11 of 12 reconstructions. Mean follow-up in the entire patient cohort was 5.3 years (range, 0.4-16.6 years). In 79% of patients symptoms had resolved or were significantly improved at last follow-up.\nSurgical treatment of benign SVC syndrome is effective over the long term, with secondary endovascular interventions to maintain graft patency. Straight spiral saphenous vein graft remains the conduit of choice for surgical reconstruction, with results superior to those with bifurcated vein and ePTFE. Endovascular treatment is effective over the short term, with frequent need for repeat interventions. It does not adversely affect future open surgical reconstruction and may prove to be a reasonable primary intervention in selected patients. Patients who are not suitable for or who fail endovascular intervention merit open surgical reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed as a prospective multicenter randomized comparison of procedure-related complications, patient recuperation, and quality-of-life outcomes between patients undergoing vein stripping with high ligation and patients undergoing great saphenous vein (GSV) obliteration with temperature-controlled radiofrequency ablation without adjunctive high ligation (Closure procedure).\nEighty-five patients (86 limbs) from five sites (France, 2; Austria, 1; United States, 2) were randomly allocated to undergo radiofrequency obliteration (RFO) or stripping and high ligation (S&L). Final analysis included data for 44 limbs in the RFO group and 36 limbs in the S&L group. Follow-up examinations were performed at 72 hours, 1 week, 3 weeks, and 4 months. All patients completed the CIVIQ2 quality-of-life (QOL) questionnaire and underwent clinical and ultrasound examinations at each follow-up visit.\nImmediate success on the day of treatment was reported for 95% (42 of 44) of limbs in the RFO group and 100% (36 of 36) of limbs in the S&L group. In seven RFO limbs (16.3%) a scan obtained 72 hours after the procedure showed flow in the proximal GSV. Five of these segments had reflux in the open segment. At 1 week two of these closed, and an additional segment closed at 3 weeks. In no cases did flow reappear after complete occlusion of the GSV. Time to return to normal activities was significantly less in the RFO group (mean, 1.15 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05-2.34) compared with the S&L group (mean, 3.89 days; CI, 2.67-5.12; P =.02). In the RFO group, 80.5% of patients returned to routine activities of daily living within 1 day, compared with 46.9% of patients in the S&L group (P <.01). Patients in the RFO group were able to return to work in 4.7 days (CI, 1.16-8.17), compared with 12.4 days (CI, 8.66-16.23) for the S&L group (P <.05). Analysis of the QOL surveys showed statistically significant differences in favor of the RFO group for global score and pain score during follow-up. The magnitude of the difference, however, progressively decreased between 1 week and 4 months.\nIn the absence of significant complications, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, severe neuritic sequelae, and skin burns, there are significant early advantages to endovascular obliteration of the GSV compared with conventional vein stripping.",

An abdominal aortic aneurysm, 48-mm in diameter, in a 68-year-old woman with HLA-B27-associated ankylosing spondylitis was successfully replaced with a tube graft. The suture lines of the aortic wall were reinforced with Teflon felt strips. Pathologic examination of the aneurysmal wall revealed hyalinization of the connective tissue, with numerous lymphocytic infiltrates, remarkable calcification, and no elastic fibers. The original structure of the arterial wall was not recognized. These findings are compatible with aortitis reported in ankylosing spondylitis.",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction of the renal artery with both saphenous vein and prosthetic material as bypass graft is durable in atherosclerotic disease. Extensive experience with saphenous vein grafts in pediatric patients and patients without atherosclerosis reveals a disturbing incidence of vein graft aneurysm degeneration. Distal renal artery reconstruction involving small branch vessels is generally not amenable to prosthetic reconstruction. We report a new approach to distal renal artery bypass grafting to avert these limitations.\nA 43-year-old man with previously normal blood pressure had malignant hypertension, which proved difficult to control despite use of a beta-blocker and an angiotensin II inhibitor. At renal angiography a fusiform aneurysm was revealed in a posterior branch of the right renal artery. The renal artery aneurysm was resected, and the left radial artery was harvested and used as a sequential aortorenal bypass graft to the two branch renal arteries. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient now has normal blood pressure with a calcium channel blocker for maintenance of the radial artery graft. Pathologic analysis revealed a pseudoaneurysm with dissection between the media and external lamella, consistent with fibromuscular dysplasia.\nAutologous artery is the preferred conduit for renal reconstruction in the pediatric population. On the basis of cardiac surgery experience, we used the radial artery and found it to be a technically satisfactory conduit for distal renal reconstruction in a patient without atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular treatment of blunt vascular trauma has been infrequently reported.\nA 27-year-old man was crushed between a fork-lift truck and a concrete platform. The physical examination was remarkable for hemodynamic stability, significant lower abdominal ecchymosis and tenderness, obvious pelvic fracture, and gross hematuria. Vascular examination revealed no femoral pulses, no pedal signals bilaterally, and minimal left leg and no right leg motor function. Arteriograms revealed right common iliac artery and external iliac artery occlusion and a 2-cm near occlusion of the left external iliac artery.\nIn the operating room, bilateral common femoral artery access was obtained, and retrograde arteriogram on the right side demonstrated free extravasation of contrast material at the level of the proximal external iliac artery. An angled glide wire was successfully traversed over the vascular injury, and two covered stents (Wallgraft, 10 x 50 mm and 8 x 30 mm) were deployed. The left iliac injury was similarly treated with an 8 x 30-mm covered stent. After calf fasciotomy, exploratory laparotomy revealed a severe sigmoid colon degloving injury, requiring resection and colostomy. A suprapubic catheter was placed because of bladder rupture, and an open-book pelvic fracture was treated with external fixation. Postoperatively the patient regained palpable bilateral pedal pulses and normal left leg function, but right leg paralysis persisted secondary to severe lumbar plexus nerve injury.\nEndovascular repair of blunt intra-abdominal arterial injuries is possible and should be particularly considered when fecal contamination, pelvic hematoma, or multiple associated injuries make conventional repair problematic.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysm is safe and effective, but recurrence of disease is frequent compared with results with surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of recombinant transforming growth factor beta(1) (rTGFbeta(1)) secreted by transplanted autologous vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) on results of endovascular treatment.\nVSMC from canine femoral arteries were infected with adenovirus vector encoding rTGFbeta(1)/green fluorescent protein (rTGFbeta(1)/GFP) or GFP only. rTGFbeta(1) production was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and autocrine and paracrine effects of rTGFbeta(1) on cell functions were quantified with a proliferation assay and collagen synthesis. A bilateral carotid aneurysm model was used to compare angiographic and pathologic results after embolization with sponges seeded (n = 14) or not seeded (n = 34) with VSMC expressing TGFbeta(1) or GFP (n = 7 each). Transgene retention was confirmed with Western blot analysis.\nIn vitro, TGFbeta(1) production varied from 0.9 to 180 ng/mL/d with increasing multiplicity of infection (MOI). Collagen synthesis was doubled at low (<300) MOI and increased by one and a half times at high (>or=300) MOI. rTGFbeta(1) was biologically active, as shown with the mink lung epithelial cell proliferation assay. VSMC grafts showed effective GFP expression up to 3 weeks after transplantation. Angiographic results were improved and neointima thickness was increased with cellular grafts, as compared with controls, but there was no significant difference between aneurysms treated with VSMC encoding rTGFbeta(1)/GFP or GFP vectors.\nCellular grafts can promote healing of aneurysms, but overexpression of rTGFbeta(1)/GFP did not demonstrate added benefits in this model.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord ischemia is a devastating complication of thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic surgery. Recent studies have suggested a neuroprotective effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids against cerebral ischemia. We investigated the effect of linolenic acid (LIN) in a rat model of spinal cord ischemia.\nRats were subjected to cross-clamping of the aortic arch and left subclavian artery for 14 minutes. Groups were as follows: sham operation (n = 15); ischemia (n = 15), receiving only vehicle; LIN A (n = 15), receiving LIN before clamping; and LIN B (n = 15), receiving LIN at onset of reperfusion. Neurologic status was assessed daily for 7 days. Spinal cords were harvested for histopathologic analysis, TUNEL staining, and immunohistochemistry for Bax, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and nuclear factor-kappaB.\nIschemic rats had severe and definitive paraplegia. LIN-treated rats had significantly better neurologic function. Histopathologic analysis disclosed severe neuronal necrosis in the lumbar gray matter of ischemic rats, whereas most of the LIN-treated rats sustained mild to moderate injury. LIN reduced the loss of motor neurons at 7 days (LIN A, 17 +/- 6, and LIN B, 15 +/- 7, versus ischemia, 6 +/- 2 per section; P <.05). LIN prevented apoptotic neuronal cell death, Bax immunoreactivity of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, and the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB. Nuclear HSP70 immunoreactivity was noted exclusively in motor neurons from LIN-treated rats and not in motor neurons from ischemic rats.\nThese results suggest that LIN can induce protection against ischemia in the spinal cord, thereby preventing both necrosis and apoptosis of motor neurons.",

    "abstract": "Human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection is often associated with chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis. However, the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. We examined the effect of Tat protein, an HIV regulatory protein, on endothelial function in porcine coronary arteries.\nPorcine coronary arteries were dissected from nine pig hearts and cut into 5-mm ring segments, which were incubated as controls or with Tat protein (10(-7), 10(-9), 10(-11) mol/L) or Tat protein plus anti-Tat antibody, for 24 hours. Myography was performed with thromboxane A(2) analog U46619 (10 (-7) mol/L) for contraction and with graded doses of bradykinin (10(-8), 10(-7), and 10(-6) mol/L) or sodium nitroprusside (10(-5) mol/L) for relaxation. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) messenger RNA was determined with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and protein levels were determined with Western blot analysis. Immunoreactivity of eNOS of treated rings was also detected.\nEndothelium-dependent vasorelaxation (10-7 mol/L of bradykinin) was significantly reduced (46.41%) in pig coronary artery rings treated with 10(-7) mol/L of Tat protein, as compared with control arteries (P <.05). Arteries treated with Tat protein plus anti-Tat antibody relaxed similarly as control arteries. There were no differences in smooth muscle contractility (U46619) or endothelium-independent vasorelaxation (sodium nitroprusside) between control and Tat protein-treated groups. RT-PCR for eNOS mRNA showed reduction in eNOS levels for Tat-treated coronary artery rings by 73%, as compared with control vessels (P <.05). Tat protein-treated vessels demonstrated substantially less eNOS protein band intensity and immunoreactivity compared with control vessels.\nTat protein significantly decreased endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and eNOS mRNA and protein expression in endothelial cells of porcine coronary arteries. This study suggests that Tat protein-mediated endothelial dysfunction may be important in coronary heart disease in HIV-infected patients.",

    "abstract": "Vascular access site thrombosis is a major cause of morbidity in patients receiving hemodialysis. The role of hypercoagulable states in recurrent vascular access site thrombosis remains poorly understood. Data are limited regarding systemic anticoagulation to improve access graft patency, because of concern about hemorrhagic complications. We determined the prevalence of hypercoagulable states and clinical outcome (thrombotic and hemorrhagic) after initiation of antithrombotic therapy in a series of patients with recurrent vascular access site thrombosis. We evaluated 31 patients who had sustained 119 thrombotic events that resulted in vascular access graft failure during the year before evaluation. Sixty-eight percent of patients tested had elevated concentrations of antibody to anticardiolipin or topical bovine thrombin, and 18% of patients tested had heparin-induced antibodies. More than 90% of patients had elevated factor VIII concentration, 62% had elevated fibrinogen concentrations, and 42% had elevated C-reactive protein concentrations. Twenty-nine patients were given antithrombotic therapy: 13 with warfarin sodium, 12 with unfractionated heparin (UFH), and 11 with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Seven patients received more than one antithrombotic agent, sequentially. Nineteen patients have had no thrombotic events since beginning antithrombotic therapy (10 with warfarin, 3 with UFH, 6 with LMWH). Mean follow-up was 8.6 months (median, 7 months). Eight patients sustained 10 bleeding complications (5 with warfarin, 3 with UFH, and 2 with LMWH). In conclusion, hypercoagulable states are common in patients with recurrent vascular access site thrombosis. Antithrombotic therapy may increase vascular access graft patency, but is associated with significant risk for hemorrhage. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the role and safety of antithrombotic agents in improving vascular access graft patency.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to investigate the possible negative effect of beta-blockers on skin microcirculation in patients with intermittent claudication and hypertension. Methods and materials In this clinical crossover study, 20 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, treated with long-term beta-blockade, and intermittent claudication or ischemic rest pain, underwent assessment of peripheral circulation before and after 2-week withdrawal of beta-blocking therapy and again 2 weeks after restarting therapy. Replacement therapy (calcium antagonist) was given if considered necessary to control hypertension. Skin microcirculation was assessed with three noninvasive techniques: capillary microscopy of the hallux nailfold, transcutaneous oximetry of the forefoot, and laser Doppler fluxmetry of the great toe.\nMean initial blood pressure was 163/81 mm Hg. Mean heart rate significantly increased with withdrawal of beta-blocker, from 65 bpm to 85 bpm. No significant differences in skin microcirculation and blood pressure were found between measurements obtained before, during, and after withdrawal of beta-blocking therapy. Patients experienced no change in symptoms during the study.\nbeta-Blockers do not appear to have a negative effect on peripheral skin microcirculation and are therefore not contraindicated to treat hypertension when intermittent claudication or ischemic rest pain is also present.",

    "abstract": "The definition of critical limb ischemia (CLI) requiring vascular intervention is still under debate. The clinical eye of the physician and ankle blood pressure measurements used so far may fall short in appreciation of the severity of disease, which makes decision-making for a vascular intervention subjective. In previous studies two simple functional tests, ie, transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tcPo(2)) and toe blood pressure (TP) measurements, provided reliable information about the need for vascular intervention. Therefore we evaluated the diagnostic value of tcPo(2) and TP in management of clinically suspected critical leg ischemia. Study design This was a diagnostic randomized controlled clinical trial. Subjects were ambulatory and hospitalized patients in a referral university hospital.\nNinety-six patients (128 legs) with clinically suspected critical limb ischemia were referred to the vascular laboratory for routine investigation. Two diagnostic management strategies were compared: conventional strategy, ie, clinical judgment and ankle pressure determined the diagnostic and therapeutic approach, and a new strategy in which tcPo(2) and TP determined the diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Main outcome measures included clinical outcome, defined as pain relief, wound healing, and limb survival.\nAt 18-month follow-up, 26 of 62 legs treated with the conventional approach and 28 of 66 legs treated with the new approach were treated conservatively. The new method did not score significantly different from the conventional method insofar as clinical outcome: pain score, 50 versus 48; number of amputations, 8 versus 10; and number of deaths, 11 versus 8 deaths, respectively.\nTwo simple objective diagnostic tests, TP and tcPo(2), did not improve clinical outcome when incorporated into routine management of suspected critical limb ischemia. Nevertheless, these techniques might still be helpful for physicians less experienced with treating critical limb ischemia and who are in doubt regarding the need for vascular intervention.",

    "abstract": "Vasomotion is the slow rhythmic contraction of the smooth muscles of arterioles, metarterioles, and precapillary sphincters. It improves rheologic function of capillary blood flow and guarantees cellular nutrition and oxygen supply. Oxygen supply to the skin by blood can be quantified by measuring oxyhemoglobin concentration and hemoglobin oxygen saturation. Material and methods We examined the consequences of disturbed vasomotion in 51 patients with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and 36 healthy control subjects. With the subjects supine as well as during orthostasis, intracutaneous changes in concentration of total hemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin and in oxygen saturation of hemoglobin were measured over 120 seconds with reflection spectrophotometry. Periodic variations in measured parameters were analyzed with modified digital Fourier transformation.\nIn the supine position both groups demonstrated the same vasomotion frequency. During orthostasis, vasomotion frequency in patients with CVI decreased significantly, from 7.4 +/- 2.2 cpm to 5.4 +/- 2.5 cpm, whereas vasomotion frequency in control subjects increased significantly, from 4.5 +/- 1.6 cpm to 8.8 +/- 2.5 cpm. Correspondingly, hemoglobin saturation and oxyhemoglobin concentration in patients with CVI patients exhibited a significantly stronger decrease compared with that in control subjects.\nThe failing increase in vasomotion frequency during standing leads to longer dilation of the distal vessels per time unit, with increase in hematocrit. This might favor formation of microthrombi in the capillaries and further perimalleolar tissue damage in CVI.",

    "abstract": "Deep venous reflux resolution after great saphenous vein surgery has been reported, but the studies evaluated mainly patients with deep segmental reflux. We prospectively analyzed the effects of greater saphenous vein ablation on coexisting primary deep axial venous reflux compared with segmental venous reflux. Patients and methods Between February 1997 and June 2001, patients with primary deep venous reflux scheduled for greater saphenous vein surgery were included in the study. Limbs of patients with a history of deep venous thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, trauma, and orthopedic or venous surgery were excluded. After surgery, duplex scanning was repeated and patients were examined for persistent deep venous reflux.\nThirty-three patients (38 limbs) were followed up with duplex scanning. Follow-up ranged from 2 weeks to 38 months. Preoperative axial deep reflux was present in 17 extremities, and segmental reflux was present in 21. The total number of incompetent segments was 59. Overall reflux abolishment rate was similar in extremities with axial and segmental reflux (30% vs 36%; P >.05). When segments were analyzed individually, abolishment of superficial femoral vein reflux was observed more often in extremities with segmental reflux than those with axial reflux (odds ratio, 4). In the extremities where deep reflux was not abolished with greater saphenous vein ablation, degree of reflux did not change significantly (P >.1). Duplex scanning was performed more than once during follow-up in 9 patients. In 3 of these patients reflux resolved by the second follow-up evaluation, and in 2 reflux was decreased at the second and third follow-up evaluations.\nIn patients with concomitant deep and superficial venous reflux, saphenous vein ablation results in resolution of deep reflux in about a third of patients. Superficial femoral vein reflux is seldom corrected in limbs with axial reflux compared with those limbs with segmental reflux. To appreciate the effects of greater saphenous vein ablation, longer follow-up may be needed.",

Risk factors that added to the difficulty of the repair included aneurysms with a short (<1 cm) or no aortic neck in 45 patients; large, angled or flared aortic neck in 32 patients;, tortuous and calcified iliac arteries in 6 patients; morbid obesity in 10 patients; low ejection fraction (15%-30%) in 14 patients; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with forced expiratory volume at 1 second less than 55% in 4 patients; previous laparotomy in 18 patients; previous left-sided colectomy in 11 patients; large right iliac aneurysm in 8 patients; large ventral hernia in 8 patients; pelvic irradiation in 4 patients; failed endovascular repair in 5 patients; and previous failed open repair attempt in 2 patients. Many of these factors occurred with significantly greater frequency (P =.04-.001) in the retroperitoneal group. All factors were correlated with outcome.\nDespite these risk factors, overall 30-day mortality was 3.5% (retroperitoneal group, 3.8%), and mean length of hospital stay was 9 days (retroperitoneal group, 8 days). There was no significant correlation between mortality or length of stay and any of the mentioned risk factors (P >.2).\nIn the era of endovascular aneurysm exclusion, open AAA repair is generally used to treat anatomically complex or difficult aneurysms, many of which are present in patients at high risk. Despite this combination of anatomic and systemic risk factors, the modified retroperitoneal approach facilitates treatment in difficult circumstances and enables open AAA repair to be performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with aortouniiliac prostheses extends the morphologic range of aneurysms that can be treated and is potentially a more rapid and simple operation than bifurcated endovascular repair. It may, however, be limited by durability of the femorofemoral extra-anatomic bypass graft required to revascularize the contralateral lower limb. Previous studies of femorofemoral bypass grafts were performed almost exclusively in patients with occlusive disease. An 8-year single center experience with use of the femorofemoral bypass graft in aneurysmal disease is reported.\nAll patients undergoing EVAR with an aortouniiliac endovascular stent graft over eight years (1994-2002) at a single institution were included in a retrospective study. Patient data were collected from a prospectively maintained local endovascular database. All patients gave informed consent and were part of an endovascular program approved by the local ethics committee.\nOver the 8 years, 231 patients underwent EVAR with an aortouniiliac endovascular stent-graft. Median follow-up was 22 months. Localized wound complications were observed in 25 patients (11%). Cumulative 3-year patency rate for the femorofemoral bypass graft was 91%. At the end of 5 years 83% of grafts remained patent.\nThe femorofemoral bypass graft used during EVAR with aortouniliac stent grafts offers encouraging medium and long-term patency. When graft occlusion occurs, it is usually directly attributable to inadequate inflow from the endovascular stent graft itself or to endoluminal damage of the external iliac artery. Awareness and early detection of stent-graft distortion or complications in the external iliac artery may result in improved patency rates.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that certain genetic risk factors indicative of an autoimmune mechanism can be identified in patients with inflammatory aortic aneurysm (IAA). We therefore investigated whether there was a higher incidence of autoimmune diseases in patients with IAA. Further, we explored risk factors, need for in-hospital resources, and early results of treatment, in a case-control study in a university hospital setting. Material and methods From 1983 to 1994, 520 patients were operated because of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Thirty-one patients had IAA. Control subjects were matched for aneurysm rupture, emergency or elective hospital admission, and date of operation. Two noninflammatory AAA were included for every IAA.\nOf the 31 patients with IAA, 6 patients (19%) had autoimmune disease, compared with none of the control subjects (P =.0017). Two patients had rheumatoid arthritis, 2 patients had systemic lupus erythematosus, 1 had giant cell arteritis, and 1 patient had an undifferentiated seronegative polyarthritis diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis. Nineteen patients (61%) with IAA had involvement of the duodenum, and 8 patients (26%) had hydronephrosis with ureteral involvement. Operating time was longer in the IAA group, which also had a higher need for blood transfusion. Hospital stay, intensive care unit stay, and 30-day mortality were similar in the two groups.\nExcept for longer operating time and more need for blood transfusions in the IAA group, use of hospital resources was similar after operations to treat IAA or noninflammatory AAA. The study findings indicate an association between IAA and autoimmune disease. This is in accordance with other reports that showed a genetic risk determinant mapped to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecule in these patients. Further research is necessary to explore whether IAA might be a separate entity with a role of antigen binding in the origin of the disease.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the use of endovascular grafts as an alternative to aortobifemoral bypass in patients with advanced aortoiliac occlusive disease at high risk.\nEndovascular grafts were placed in 23 limbs in 22 patients with TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus document (TASC) type C and D lesions. All procedures were performed in the operating room, and images were obtained with portable digital fluoroscopy. Surgical exposure of the ipsilateral common femoral artery was performed to enable safe closure of 9F to 12F sheath sites and to facilitate ipsilateral interventions in the distal external iliac artery. Concomitant infrainguinal outflow procedures were performed in 6 patients.\nTwenty of 22 patients were men; mean patient age was 63.2 +/- 3.2 years. Indications for intervention were rest pain in 12 of 23 limbs and tissue loss in 9 of 22 limbs. Risk factors included hostile abdomen or pelvis in 8 patients, coronary artery disease in 11 patients, end-stage renal disease in 3 patients, and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 3 patients. Each patient received a mean of 1.6 grafts. Initial technical success was 95.2%, with one technical failure. There was no 30-day mortality. All patients experienced at least one grade improvement per Society for Vascular Surgery reporting standards. Primary patency at 24 months was 84.2% +/- 8.0%, with a limb salvage rate of 95.3% +/- 5.0%. Mean (+/- SD) ankle brachial index improved from 0.49 +/- 0.22 to 0.87 +/- 0.26 (P <.001).\nEndovascular grafting to treat advanced aortoiliac occlusive disease can be accomplished with good clinical outcome and acceptable short-term patency.

    "abstract": "Inadequate infrainguinal runoff is considered an important risk factor for iliac stent failure. However, the influence of concomitant infrainguinal arterial reconstruction (CIAR) on iliac stent patency is unknown. This study evaluated the influence of CIAR on outcome of iliac angioplasty and stenting (IAS) in patients with poor distal runoff.\nOver 5 years (1996 to 2001), 68 IAS procedures (78 stents) were performed in 62 patients with poor distal runoff (angiographic runoff score >or=5). The SVS/AAVS reporting standards were followed to define outcome variables and risk factors. Data were analyzed with both univariate analysis (Kaplan-Meier method [K-M]) and regression analysis (Cox proportional hazards model).\nIndications for iliac artery stenting were disabling claudication (59%) and limb salvage (41%). Of the 68 procedures, IAS with CIAR was performed in 31 patients (46%), and IAS alone was performed in 37 patients (54%). Patients undergoing IAS with CIAR were older (P =.03) and had more extensive and multifocal iliac artery occlusive disease, with more TASC (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus) type C lesions (P =.03), compared with patients undergoing IAS alone. No other significant differences in risk factors were noted. Runoff scores between patients undergoing IAS with CIAR and those undergoing IAS alone were not significantly different (median runoff scores, 6 [range, 5-8] and 7 [range, 5-9], respectively; P =.77). Primary stent patency rate at 1, 3, and 5 years was 87%, 54%, and 42%, respectively, for patients undergoing IAS with CIAR, and was 76%, 66%, and 55%, respectively, for patients undergoing IAS. Univariate analysis revealed that primary stent patency rate was not significantly different between the 2 groups (K-M, log-rank test, P =.81). Primary graft patency rate for CIAR was 81%, 52%, and 46% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Performing CIAR did not affect primary iliac stent patency (relative risk, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-2.47; P =.81). Overall, there was a trend toward improved limb salvage in patients undergoing IAS with CIAR, compared with those undergoing IAS alone (K-M, log rank test, P =.07).\nIn patients undergoing IAS with poor distal runoff, CIAR does not improve iliac artery stent patency. Infrainguinal bypass procedures should therefore be reserved for patients who do not demonstrate clinical improvement and possibly for those with limb-threatening ischemia.",

Univariate analysis revealed that primary stent patency rate was not significantly different between the 2 groups (K-M, log-rank test, P =.81). Primary graft patency rate for CIAR was 81%, 52%, and 46% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Performing CIAR did not affect primary iliac stent patency (relative risk, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-2.47; P =.81). Overall, there was a trend toward improved limb salvage in patients undergoing IAS with CIAR, compared with those undergoing IAS alone (K-M, log rank test, P =.07).",

    "abstract": "Accurate diameter measurements of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with both computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) are essential for screening, planning surgical intervention, and follow-up after endovascular repair. Often there is a discrepancy between measurements obtained with CT and US, and neither limit of agreement (LOA) nor correlation between the two imaging methods has been clearly established. The purpose of this study was to assess the paired differences in AAA diameter measurements obtained with CT and US in a large national endograft trial.\nCT and US measurements were obtained from an independent core laboratory established to assess imaging data in a national endograft trial (Ancure; Guidant, Menlo Park, Calif). The study included only baseline examinations in which both CT and US measurements were available. Axial CT images and transverse US images were assessed for maximal AAA diameter and recorded as CT(max) and US(max), respectively. Correlations and LOA were performed between all image diameters, and differences in their means were assessed with paired t test.\nA total of 334 concurrent measurements were available at baseline after endovascular repair. CT(max) was greater than US(max) in 95% (n = 312), and mean CT(max) (5.69 +/- 0.89 cm) was significantly larger (P <.001) than mean US(max) (4.74 +/- 0.91 cm). The correlation coefficient between CT(max) and US(max) was 0.705, but the difference between the two was less than 1.0 cm in only 51%. There was less discrepancy between CT(max) and US(max) for small AAA (0.7 cm, 15.3%) compared with medium (0.9 cm, 17.9%) and large (1.46 cm, 20.3%) AAA; however, the difference was not statistically significant. LOA between CT(max) and US(max) (-0.45-2.36 cm) exceeded the limits of clinical acceptability (-0.5-0.5 cm). Poor LOA was also found in each subgroup based on AAA size.\nMaximal AAA diameter measured with CT is significantly and consistently larger than maximal AAA diameter measured with US. The clinical significance of this difference and its cause remains a subject for further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Retroperitoneal iliac procedures can enable successful endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in patients who otherwise would not be anatomically eligible. The purpose of this study was to determine perioperative outcome with adjunctive retroperitoneal procedures compared with standard bilateral femoral exposure.\nBetween August 1997 and November 2002, 164 patients underwent elective endovascular AAA repair at a single university medical center. Anatomic, demographic, and early postoperative outcome data gathered prospectively were analyzed. Thirty-two patients (20%) underwent 38 separate adjunctive retroperitoneal procedures. Indications included small external iliac arteries (16 of 32 patients; 50%) and concomitant iliac aneurysm that precluded fixation of the endograft limbs in the common iliac arteries (16 of 32 patients; 50%). The 38 procedures consisted of 8 iliac conduits only, 14 iliac conduits with iliofemoral bypass grafts, and 16 hypogastric revascularization procedures. Data for the study patients were compared with data for 132 patients who underwent endovascular AAA repair through femoral incisions. Primary end points were hospital length of stay, and early morbidity and mortality.\nRetroperitoneal procedures enabled an additional 14% of patients with AAA to undergo endovascular techniques. However, there was a significantly higher proportion of women and patients at high risk for anesthesia (American Society of Anesthesiologists class IV or higher) in the group who underwent retroperitoneal procedures. On average, retroperitoneal procedures were associated with 2.6-fold greater blood loss, 82% longer procedure time, 1.5 days additional hospital stay, and 1.8-fold higher rate of perioperative complications, compared with endovascular AAA repair with femoral exposure alone. In contrast, early mortality was similar in the two groups.\nAdjunctive retroperitoneal procedures during endovascular AAA repair are associated with increased risk for complications and longer hospital length of stay, compared with AAA repair with standard femoral exposure only. They do not, however, increase early mortality, even in patients at high risk, and enable a larger subset of patients with AAA to undergo endovascular repair.",

    "abstract": "Several reports have demonstrated the efficacy of inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) placement with intravascular ultrasound guidance (IVUS). The majority of these procedures,however, have been done in concert with contrast venography and/or fluoroscopic guidance. The purpose of this report was to evaluate the potential for bedside IVCF placement with \"real-time\" IVUS guidance only.\nIn a phase I trial, 10 patients underwent IVUS interrogation of the IVC for diameter measurements and localization of the renal veins. Contrast venography verified the IVUS findings prior to filter deployment. In a phase II trial, another 35 patients underwent intensive care unit bedside placement of an IVC filter with only \"real time\" IVUS guidance using a double puncture technique in the same femoral vein. All patients underwent color-flow ultrasonography of the femoral veins after filter placement to rule out post procedure femoral vein thrombosis and plain radiographs of the abdomen to identify filter location.\nIn the phase I trial, all filters were placed within 15 mm of the most inferior renal vein identified by IVUS. There were no complications, and successful filter placement was verified by contrast venography. In phase II, 33 IVCFs were placed without complications at approximately the L2 level by plain radiograph. One patient had an IVCF deployed in the common iliac vein, which necessitated placement of an uneventful second IVCF at the infrarenal location by IVUS. This same patient had a femoral deep venous thrombosis identified by postoperative duplex ultrasonography. A second patient had IVC thrombus identified by IVUS, and placement was performed with contrast venography in the fluoroscopy suite. IVC measurements ranged from 18-28 mm in diameter.\nIVUS accurately measures the IVC diameter and localizes the renal veins, allowing for exact placement of IVCFs. IVUS further avoids the need for contrast agents and for transport of critically ill patients. Bedside insertion of an IVcF with IVUS guidance is simple, safe, and accurate. Further assessment of this technique is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma, which has the propensity for rapid enlargement and local invasion, may present a surgical challenge, in part because of extensive vascularity. Conventional treatment typically involves staged preoperative renal artery embolization followed by nephrectomy after 1 or 2 days. We evaluated the clinical outcome of concomitant intraoperative embolization and nephrectomy.\nOver 7 years, eight patients with renal cell carcinoma underwent combined intraoperative renal artery coil embolization and nephrectomy. A cohort of 14 patients who underwent staged renal embolization and nephrectomy during the same period served as the control group. Renal tumor embolization was achieved via percutaneous femoral artery approach, followed by coil placement in the distal portion of the main renal artery. Complete renal artery embolization was confirmed with intraoperative angiography. Nephrectomy was performed either concomitantly or after renal artery embolization, dependent on treatment group. Intraoperative data, clinical outcome, and hospital cost were compared between the two groups.\nRenal artery embolization and nephrectomy were successfully performed in all patients. There was no perioperative mortality. Mean hospital length of stay in the combined and staged treatment groups was 5.6 +/- 1.3 days and 10.2 +/- 3.2 days, respectively. Post-infarction syndrome developed in four patients (36%) in the staged group, compared with no patients in the combined treatment group. Decreased room cost and radiology cost was noted in the combined treatment group compared with the staged group. Mean total hospital cost was significantly less in patients who underwent the combined treatment compared with the staged treatment approach (mean difference, US dollars 9214; P =.02) During mean follow-up of 36 months, six patients (27%) died of unrelated causes. There was no evidence of tumor recurrence in surviving patients.\nIn patients with renal cell carcinoma, combined renal embolization and nephrectomy minimizes patient discomfort and post-infarction syndrome associated with traditional staged treatment. Moreover, it is associated with reduced hospital costs, due in part to decreased hospital length of stay. Vascular surgeons with endovascular skills are well suited to perform intraoperative renal artery embolization. Use of adjunctive endovascular techniques to facilitate large open procedures is a growing role for the endovascular-competent vascular surgeon.",

    "abstract": "The Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative (DOQI) guidelines recommend that arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) be constructed in at least 50% of hemodialysis access procedures. Preoperative duplex ultrasound (US) scanning and venography may increase options for AVF with identification of veins that are not clinically evident. However, maturation of autogenous fistulas created on the basis of findings at duplex US scanning and venography has not been carefully examined.\nFrom January 1999 to July 2002, 256 new hemodialysis access procedures were performed in 202 patients in an academic tertiary care center. If physical examination failed to disclose adequate vessels for hemodialysis access, patients underwent duplex US scanning mapping. Venography was performed when no usable vein or only a basilic vein was identified at duplex US scanning. Functional maturation rate and mean maturation time (time from fistula creation to initiation of hemodialysis) were determined. This experience was compared with that in a group of 128 patients in whom 148 hemodialysis access fistulas were created before we implemented liberal use of preoperative duplex US scanning and venography (January 1997-December 1998).\nFrom January 1999 to July 2002, preoperative duplex US scanning was performed in 68% of patients, and venography in 32% of patients. Autogenous fistula creation rate increased from 61% to 73% in all patients with hemodialysis access fistulas (P =.15) and from 66% to 83% in patients undergoing a first access procedure (P <.05). The use of basilic vein transposition also increased, from 3% in the earlier period to 13% in the later period (P <.05). Mean maturation time for arteriovenous fistulas was 70 days. Functional maturation rate decreased from 73% to 57% (P <.05) after implementation of preoperative imaging and more aggressive vein use.\nImplementation of preoperative duplex US scanning and venography as a component of a more aggressive protocol to create native fistulas was pivotal in exceeding DOQI guidelines for hemodialysis access. However, this approach resulted in the unintended sequela of decreased fistula maturation rate. Our experience suggests that improved selection criteria based on findings at preoperative imaging are needed to further refine and optimize arteriovenous access surgery.",

    "abstract": "We compared outcome and durability of carotid stent-assisted angioplasty (CAS) with open surgical repair (ie, repeat carotid endarterectomy [CEA]) to treat recurrent carotid stenosis (RCS).\nA retrospective review of anatomic and neurologic outcomes was carried out after 27 repeat CEA procedures (1993-2002) and 52 CAS procedures (1997-2002) performed to treat high-grade internal carotid artery (ICA) RCS after CEA. The incidence of intervention because of symptomatic RCS was similar (repeat CEA, 63%; CAS, 60%), but the interval from primary CEA to repeat intervention was greater (P <.05) in the repeat CEA group (83 +/- 15 months) compared with the CAS group (50 +/- 8 months). In the CAS group, 17 of 52 arteries (33%) were judged not to be surgical candidates because of surgically inaccessible high lesions (n = 8), medical comorbid conditions (n = 4), neck irradiation (n = 3), or previous surgery with cranial nerve deficit or stroke (n = 2). Three patients who underwent repeat CEA had lesions not appropriate for treatment with CAS.\nOverall 30-day morbidity was similar after CAS (12%; death due to ipsilateral intracranial hemorrhage, 1; nondisabling stroke, 1; reversible neurologic deficits or transient ischemic attack, 2; access site complication, 2). and repeat CEA (11%; no death; nondisabling stroke, 1; reversible cranial nerve injury, 1; cervical hematoma, 1). Combined stroke and death rate was 3.7% for repeat CEA and 5.7% for CAS (P >.1). All duplex ultrasound scans obtained within 3 months after CEA and CAS demonstrated patent ICA and velocity spectra of less than 50% stenosis. During follow-up, no repeat CEA (mean, 39 months) or CAS (mean, 26 months) repair demonstrated ICA occlusion, but two patients (8%) who underwent repeat CEA and 4 patients (8%) who underwent CAS required balloon or stent angioplasty because of 80% RCS. At last follow-up, no patient had ipsilateral stroke and all ICA remain patent. At duplex scanning, stenosis-free (<50% diameter reduction) ICA patency at 36 months was 75% after repeat CEA and 57% after CAS (P =.26, log-rank test).\nCarotid angioplasty for treatment of high-grade stenotic ICA after CEA resulted in similar anatomic and neurologic outcomes compared with open surgical repair. Most lesions are amenable to endovascular therapy, and CAS enabled treatment in patients judged not to be suitable surgical candidates. Duplex scanning surveillance after repeat CEA or CAS is recommended, because stenosis can recur after either secondary procedure.",

    "abstract": "We prospectively evaluated whether magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) enabled definition of cerebrovascular anatomy after indeterminate or inadequate results at duplex ultrasound scanning to facilitate patient selection for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and for technical planning.\nAfter implementation of a protocol in October 1998 to minimize use of cerebral arteriography, MRA (arch/cervical two-dimensional and cranial three-dimensional time of flight technique) was performed in 138 consecutive patients with cerebrovascular occlusive disease and inconclusive duplex scans obtained by an ICAVL-approved laboratory. The ability of MRA to define anatomic features unresolved at duplex scanning was compared between categories of duplex scan inadequacies. Operative outcome was compared between patients requiring MRA before CEA (n = 66) and a concurrent cohort undergoing CEA on the basis of duplex scan results only (n = 69).\nIncomplete imaging of the carotid bifurcation, because of high bifurcation, long (>3 cm) internal carotid artery (ICA) plaque, or calcific shadows, was the most common reason for inadequate duplex scans (n = 74, 53%), followed by borderline severe ICA disease (23.17%), suspected extracervical disease (supra-aortic trunk, vertebral, or intracranial, 22, 16%), ICA near- occlusion (12.9%), and diffuse recurrent stenosis (7.5%). MRA enabled resolution of duplex scan inadequacies in 95% of patients with disease confined to the carotid bifurcation, and 90% of all patients, but was least accurate for delineation of extracervical lesions (77%) and near-occlusions (75%). In 5 of 8 patients (6%) arteriography was performed to determine operability of ICA near-occlusion or extracervical lesions. Combined stroke and death rates after CEA were not statistically different (P =.3) between patients requiring MRA (3 of 66, 4.6%) and the concurrent group in whom MRA was performed solely on the basis of duplex results (1 of 69, 1.5%). However, intraoperative technical adjustments (anatomy that precluded shunt use, extended endarterectomy length, ICA shortening due to tortuosity) were planned in 71% of patients (12 of 17) with MRA-defined anatomy, but only 36% of patients (4 of 11) with long CEA on the basis of duplex results only (P =.08).\nMRA replaces the need for cerebral arteriography in most patients after inadequate carotid duplex scanning.

This component is inserted through the carotid artery and deployed with the trunk and short wide limb in the ascending thoracic aorta; the long narrow limb opens into the innominate artery. After delivery system removal and carotid artery repair, a distal component is inserted through a femoral approach to bridge the gap between the short, wide distal limb of the proximal component and the nondilated descending thoracic aorta. The result is a branched stent graft, implanted proximally into the ascending aorta and distally into the innominate artery and descending thoracic aorta.\nThe system has been used successfully to treat a large wide-necked pseudoaneurysm of the aortic arch.",

    "abstract": "The in situ bypass procedure for lower extremity limb salvage requires a long continuous incision or multiple interrupted incisions over the greater saphenous vein to ligate the saphenous vein side branches. This can result in wound complications that frequently prolong hospital stay and threaten the graft. In an effort to reduce the incidence of wound complications, alternate methods of occluding the vein side branches have been used. One method is to deliver coils under angioscopic vision into the saphenous vein side branches. This report details a simplified technique that uses widely available catheter-based equipment to perform saphenous vein side branch occlusion under fluoroscopic guidance.",

In both cases, an Ancure endograft (Guidant/EVT, Menlo Park, Calif) was placed.\nIn case 1, a large endoleak developed 36 months after uncomplicated endovascular treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. In case 2, endoleak developed 30 months after a complicated procedure. In both cases, two Wallstents were used to treat type I endoleak and limb kinking in the first postoperative months. One type III endoleak was within the endograft at the level of the stents.\nTo our knowledge, these are the first type III endoleaks reported in association with Ancure endografts. Placement of Wallstents inside endografts is of concern, and another indication for close monitoring during follow-up.",

We report three patients who underwent successful endovascular AAA repair in whom postoperative surveillance showed aneurysm regression, yet delayed AAA enlargement without demonstrable endoleak developed in all three patients. Endotension was confirmed in all three patients at elective open conversion. Our study underscores the significance of endotension as a mechanism of delayed aneurysm enlargement after successful endovascular AAA repair.",

    "abstract": "Upper extremity embolic complications of occluded axillofemoral bypass grafts are infrequent. However, traditional management of dissection of axillary anastomosis for removal of the stump can be challenging. We report two patients with critical upper extremity ischemia secondary to stump syndrome and its successful management with endovascular techniques.\nOne hundred fifty-two patients underwent axillofemoral bypass grafting over 10 years from 1991-2001. Two patients from this series had acute ischemia involving the ipsilateral upper extremity of occluded axillofemoral bypass graft. Duplex ultrasound scans revealed occlusion of the axillofemoral bypass graft and acute occlusion of ipsilateral upper extremity arteries. Both patients underwent brachial artery exploration and embolectomy. Completion angiograms revealed persistent axillofemoral bypass graft stump as the source of embolus. The stump was obliterated with a 10-mm/40-mm Wallgraft introduced through the same arteriotomy made for brachial embolectomy. Transesophageal echocardiography and magnetic resonance angiography of the arch and great vessels were performed to exclude other sources of origin for the embolus.\nBoth patients remained symptom-free and with patent stent grafts, as seen on duplex scans at 3, 6, and 9 months of follow-up.\nUpper extremity embolism is a rare complication after occlusion of axillofemoral bypass grafts. The endovascular approach to obliterate the stump of occluded axillofemoral bypass grafts is minimally invasive and an effective alternative treatment of this rare condition.",

    "abstract": "Discrete morphologic, enzymatic and functional changes in skeletal muscle mitochondria have been demonstrated in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We examined mitochondrial respiration in the gastrocnemius muscle of nine patients (10 legs) with advanced PAD and in nine control patients (nine legs) without evidence of PAD.\nMitochondrial respiratory rates were determined with a Clark electrode in an oxygraph cell containing saponin-skinned muscle bundles. Muscle samples were obtained from the anteromedial aspect of the gastrocnemius muscle, at a level 10 cm distal to the tibial tuberosity. Mitochondria respiratory rate, calculated as nanoatoms of oxygen consumed per minute per milligram of noncollagen protein, were measured at baseline (V(0)), after addition of substrates (malate and glutamate; (V(SUB)), after addition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (V(ADP)), and finally, after adenine nucleotide translocase inhibition with atractyloside (V(AT)). The acceptor control ratio, a sensitive indicator of overall mitochondrial function, was calculated as the ratio of the respiratory rate after the addition of ADP to the respiratory rate after adenine nucleotide translocase inhibition with atractyloside (V(ADP)/ V(AT)).\nRespiratory rate in muscle mitochondria from patients with PAD were not significantly different from control values at baseline (0.31 +/- 0.06 vs 0.55 +/- 0.12; P =.09), but V(sub) was significantly lower in patients with PAD compared with control subjects (0.43 +/- 0.07 vs 0.89 +/- 0.20; P <.05), as was V(ADP) (0.69 +/- 0.13 vs 1.24 +/- 0.20; P <.05). Respiratory rates after atractyloside inhibition in patients with PAD were no different from those in control patients (0.47 +/- 0.07 vs 0.45 +/- P =.08). Compared with control values, mitochondria from patients with PAD had a significantly lower acceptor control ratio (1.41 +/- 0.10 vs 2.90 +/- 0.20; P <.001).\nMitochondrial respiratory activity is abnormal in lower extremity skeletal muscle in patients with PAD. When considered in concert with the ultrastructural and enzymatic abnormalities previously documented in mitochondria of chronically ischemic muscle, these data support the concept of defective mitochondrial function as a pathophysiologic component of PAD.",

    "abstract": "Although nitric oxide (NO) has a critical role in angiogenesis, the therapeutic potential of NO synthase overexpression in severe ischemia remains undefined. We tested the hypothesis that overexpression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) would improve tissue perfusion in severe hind limb ischemia.\nSevere hind limb ischemia was induced in 122 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Ten days after the induction of hind limb ischemia, vascular isolation and intraarterial delivery of an adenoviral vector encoding eNOS (AdeNOS), a control adenoviral vector (AdE1), or phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) was performed. Skeletal muscle blood flow, muscle oxygen tension, angiography, and immunohistochemistry for capillary counts were measured.\nGene transfer of AdeNOS increased eNOS protein expression and enzyme activity. Two weeks after gene transfer, skeletal muscle blood flow was fourfold higher in eNOS-transduced than in AdE1-transduced or PBS treated rats and was similar to exercise-induced maximal flow in nonischemic muscle. eNOS overexpression increased muscle oxygen tension in a titer-dependent fashion. This increase persisted 1 month after transduction, even though eNOS enzyme activity had declined to normal levels. Angiography and capillary counts showed that eNOS overexpression increased the size and number of collateral arteries, but did not significantly increase the capillary-muscle fiber ratio.\neNOS overexpression in an ischemic rat hind limb significantly increased skeletal muscle blood flow, muscle oxygen tension, and collateral arteries (arteriogenesis). Furthermore, eNOS overexpression did not result in capillary angiogenesis above control levels. These studies demonstrate the potential for eNOS overexpression as treatment for severe limb ischemia in human beings.",

    "abstract": "Vascular injury and inflammation are associated with elaboration of a number of cytokines that signal through multiple pathways to act as smooth muscle cell (SMC) mitogens. Activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) transcription factor is essential for SMC proliferation in vitro and is activated by vascular injury in vivo. Activation of NF-kappaB is controlled by several upstream regulators, including the inhibitors of kappa B (IkappaB). These proteins bind to and keep NF-kappaB inactivated. The purpose of this study was to determine whether adenoviral gene transfer of a mutated IkappaBalpha super-repressor (AdIkappaBalphaSR) could inhibit development of intimal hyperplasia in vivo and to investigate how over-expression of this construct influences in vitro SMC proliferation and cell cycle regulatory proteins.\nA rat carotid injury model was used to study prevention of intimal hyperplasia. Arteries were assayed 14 days after injury and infection with AdIkappaBalphaSR or adenoviral beta-galactosidase (AdLacZ). Untreated SMC or SMC infected with AdLacZ or AdIkappaBalphaSR were stimulated with 10% fetal bovine serum, interleukin-1beta, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to assay for NF-kappaB activation. Protein levels of IkappaBalpha and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Cip1/Waf1) and p27(Kip1) were determined with Western blot analysis. Proliferation was measured with (3)H-thymidine incorporation assays.\nAdIkappaBalphaSR inhibited the development of intimal hyperplasia by 49% (P <.05). Infection with AdIkappaBalphaSR significantly suppressed in vitro SMC proliferation when stimulated with serum, interleukin 1, or tumor necrosis factor alpha, and did not result in cell death. Inhibition of proliferation was associated with increased p21(Cip1/Waf1) and p27(Kip1) protein levels.\nGene transfer of IkappaBalpha super-repressor inhibited development of intimal hyperplasia in vivo and SMC proliferation in vitro. The antiproliferative activity may be related to cell cycle arrest through upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27. Overexpression of IkappaBalpha may be a future therapeutic option in treatment of vascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "This prospective study was designed to determine the upper limits of normal for duration and maximum velocity of retrograde flow (RF) in lower extremity veins.\nEighty limbs in 40 healthy subjects and 60 limbs in 45 patients with chronic venous disease were examined with duplex scanning in the standing and supine positions. Each limb was assessed for reflux at 16 venous sites, including the common femoral, deep femoral, and proximal and distal femoral veins; proximal and distal popliteal veins; gastrocnemial vein; anterior and posterior tibial veins; peroneal vein; greater saphenous vein, at the saphenofemoral junction, thigh, upper calf, and lower calf; and lesser saphenous vein, at the saphenopopliteal junction and mid-calf. Perforator veins along the course of these veins were also assessed. In the healthy volunteers, 1553 vein segments were assessed, including 480 superficial vein segments, 800 deep vein segments, and 273 perforator vein segments; and in the patients, 1272 vein segments were assessed, including 360 superficial vein segments, 600 deep vein segments, and 312 perforator vein segments. Detection and measurement of reflux were performed at duplex scanning. Standard pneumatic cuff compression pressure was used to elicit reflux. Duration of RF and peak vein velocity were measured immediately after release of compression.\nDuration of RF in the superficial veins ranged from 0 to 2400 ms (mean, 210 ms), and was less than 500 ms in 96.7% of these veins. In the perforator veins, regardless of location, outward flow ranged from 0 to 760 ms (mean, 170 ms), and was less than 350 ms in 97% of these veins. In the deep veins, RF ranged from 0 to 2600 ms. Mean RF in the deep femoral veins and calf veins was 190 ms, and was less than 500 ms in 97.6% of these veins. In the femoropopliteal veins, mean RF was 390 ms, and ranged from 510 to 2600 ms in 21 of 400 segments; however, RF was less than 990 ms in 99% of these veins. Duration of RF was significantly longer in all three veins systems in patients (P <.0001 for all comparisons). With a cutoff value of more than 1000 ms rather than more than 500 ms, prevalence of abnormal RF in the femoropopliteal veins was significantly reduced, from 29% to 18% (P =.002). Thirty-seven vein segments (2.4%) had RF greater than 500 ms in the supine position, compared with less than 500 ms in 22 of these vein segments (59%) in the standing position. Of the 48 vein segments (3.1%) with RF greater than 500 ms in the standing position, RF was less than 500 ms in 6 of these vein segments (13%) in the supine position. Similar observations were noted in patient veins. There was no association between RF and peak vein velocity. Peak vein velocity had no significance in determining reflux.\nThe cutoff value for reflux in the superficial and deep calf veins is greater than 500 ms. However, the reflux cutoff value for the femoropopliteal veins should be greater than 1000 ms. Outward flow in the perforating veins should be considered abnormal at greater than 350 ms. Reflux testing should be performed with the patient standing.",

    "abstract": "Internal diameter is a strong predictor of patency of infrainguinal vein grafts. However, most vein grafts are tapered, with variable diameter along their length. It is unknown which diameter is most important in determining graft resistive properties, that is, its mean diameter, minimum diameter, or some geometric combination thereof. The purpose of this analysis was to examine the hydraulic consequences of vein graft tapering, with longitudinal impedance (Z(L)), a conduit-specific measure of pulsatile resistance along straight rigid tubes.\nProximal and distal graft pressure, pressure gradient (DeltaP), and blood flow (Q) were measured intraoperatively in a 100 cm bypass graft and digitally recorded for 10 seconds at 200 Hz. With the Womersley solution for fully developed fluid flow in a rigid tube, a series of DeltaP waveforms were generated for graft diameters ranging from 1.2 to 8.2 mm. With an axisymmetric form of the Navier-Stokes equations, a second series of DeltaP waveforms were computed for grafts with long smooth symmetric tapers ranging from 0% to 90%, with geometric mean diameter of 3.2, 4.2, and 5.2 mm (%Taper = 100 x [proximal diameter - distal diameter]/proximal diameter). For each set of DeltaP and Q, Z(L) was calculated as DeltaP/Q, plotted over a range of 8 Hz, and integrated over 4 Hz to yield integral Z(L).\nThe architecture of the calculated DeltaP and Z(L) waveforms closely approximated their measured counterparts, validating the method. As expected, Z(L) was highly diameter-dependent in a nonlinear fashion. With a clinically relevant boundary of less than 50 x 10(3) dyne/cm(5) as \"acceptable,\" the minimum acceptable diameter of nontapered 100 cm bypass conduits was 4.3 mm. Analysis of graft taper revealed that small amounts of taper in large conduits were well-tolerated. For example, introduction of 32% taper in a 5.2 mm graft (6.2 mm --> 4.2 mm) caused only an 8% increase in integral Z(L) (from 32 to 35 x 10(3) dyne/cm(5)). More pronounced taper in smaller conduits rendered them unacceptable. For example, 53% taper of a 4.2 mm graft (5.7 mm --> 2.7 mm) created a conduit with integral Z(L) of 70 x 10(3) dyne/cm(5), well above the acceptable limit. The relationship between Z(L) and percent taper was nonlinear and strongly dependent on mean diameter.\nThe relationship between Z(L) and diameter in vein grafts is nonlinear; thus Z(L) increases rapidly in conduits smaller than 4 mm. Tapered vein grafts behave hydraulically like nontapered grafts, provided their geometric mean is greater than 4 mm and their degree of taper is less than 40%. Tapered veins are satisfactory conduits for long-segment bypass grafts, provided their mean diameter is acceptable.",

    "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to investigate variations between states and changes in state-specific carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and 30-day mortality rates. Cross-sectional variations and changes over time in such measures may be indicative of improvement in the quality of care.\nWe performed retrospective analyses of pre-existing administrative data on Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older in the United States. Age-adjusted, state-specific CEA rates and 30-day postoperative mortality rates in 1991, 1995 and 2000 were examined, as well as changes in these rates from 1991 to 1995 and from 1995 to 2000. Stroke mortality in the general population of each state was used as a crude measure of the need for CEA procedure in the state. The Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to study correlations between rates. Oldham's method was used to avoid the effect of regression to the mean.\nThere were wide variations in the state-specific CEA rates, 30-day mortality, and in changes in these rates over time. The states with relatively low procedure rates in 1991 also had low rates in 1995 and 2000, and relatively higher increases in the rates. The states with relatively high 30-day mortality in 1991 or 1995 had lower increases or greater decreases in the rate. CEA rates were not correlated with any measure of surgical mortality, but they were correlated with stroke mortality in the general population.\nThe inter-state variation in CEA rates has not changed much since 1991, but variation in 30-day mortality decreased through 2000. The states with low procedure rates in 1991 did not have sufficient increase to catch up with the high-rate states by 1995, but they were prone to experience a higher increase in the subsequent 5 years. The validity of stroke mortality in a state as a measure of the need for CEA is questionable. Further research using clinical data is needed to better explain variations between states.",

    "abstract": "Few studies to date have examined the relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia and peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) in young women. In this study we assessed hyperhomocysteinemia as a risk factor for PAOD in young women. In addition, we evaluated the effect of joint exposure to hyperhomocysteinemia and traditional risk factors.\nTwo hundred twenty women, ages 18 to 49 years, with PAOD and 629 healthy women (control group) from a population-based case-control study filled out the same structured questionnaire and donated venous blood samples for determination of plasma homocysteine levels. Hyperhomocysteinemia was defined as nonfasting total plasma homocysteine level above the 90th percentile of the control range.\nYoung women with hyperhomocysteinemia had a 2.5-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-3.9) increased risk for PAOD. When presence of hyperhomocysteinemia was combined with presence of a traditional risk factor, relative risk strongly increased in smokers (odds ratio [OR], 18.9; 95% CI, 8.3-42.9) and in women with hypertension (OR, 10.3; 95% CI, 5.4-19.8), hypercholesterolemia (OR, 8.5; 95% CI, 4.2-17.1), and diabetes (OR, 8.9; 95% CI, 1.7-46.9).\nHyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for PAOD in young women. There is a strong synergistic effect between hyperhomocysteinemia and all traditional vascular risk factors. Our findings may have implications for risk management in these young women.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the fibrin sealant Beriplast P (FSBP; Aventis-Behring) for hemostasis in anastomosis of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts to the femoral artery.\nIn a single-blinded randomized prospective multicenter clinical trial, FSBP was compared with thrombin-soaked gelatin sponge (TSG) for efficacy in stopping bleeding from needle or suture holes in PTFE grafts after anastomosis to the femoral artery. Patients were randomized to FSBP application, which requires a 3-minute period of arterial clamping to enable the fibrin clot to adhere, or to TSG application, which requires pressure from gauze sponges, after completion of the femoral artery anastomosis. The primary end point was hemostasis, defined as absence of any detectable bleeding as judged by the operating surgeon, by 4 minutes after randomization. Secondary end points included actual time from randomization to hemostasis, time to beginning of wound closure, measured blood loss (weighed sponges), incidence of recurrent bleeding, stay in the intensive care unit, and hospital length of stay. Data were analyzed with the intention-to-treat method.\nTwo hundred thirty-five subjects were enrolled at 26 medical centers; 34 were subsequently excluded from the study. Of the 201 randomized subjects, 100 received FSBP and 99 received TSG. Hemostasis was achieved by 4 minutes in 64 subjects (63%) in the FSBP group and 40 subjects (40%) in the TSG group (P =.0018). In the FSBP group, compared with the TSG group, time to hemostasis was shorter (median, 4.0 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.8-4.18 minutes vs median, 5.6 minutes, 95% CI, 4.5-7.0; P =.008), blood loss was less (mean, 4.0 +/- 29.7 g vs mean, 15.6 +/- 28.4 g; P <.0001), and time to wound closure was shorter (median, 15 minutes; 95% CI, 10.47-18.67 minutes vs median, 22.8 minutes; 95% CI, 18.67-30.67; P =.005). There were no differences in recurrent bleeding or any other adverse events. There was no significant difference in ICU stay, but hospital length of stay was shorter in the FSBP group compared with the TSG group, and the difference approached significance (median, 6.5 days; 95% CI, 5.00-7.00 days vs median, 7.0 days; 95% CI,. 6.00-8.00 days; P =.0565).\nFSBP is more effective than TSG for achieving hemostasis of needle or suture hole bleeding from PTFE femoral artery grafts.",

    "abstract": "We present extended follow-up findings of the Kingston prospective sizing program for patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) smaller than 5.0 cm in diameter, with gender-specific analysis.\nFrom 1976 to 2001, 895 patients (688 men, 207 women) with AAA smaller than 5.0 cm were entered, regardless of fitness, in a prospective sizing program in which computed tomography scans were obtained every 6 months. Operations were performed in fit patients with an increase in AAA size to 5 cm (n = 190), AAA expansion greater than 0.5 cm in 6 months (n = 27), or for other reasons (n = 33). Follow-up continued until AAA rupture, surgery, death, or removal from the program.\nNo AAA smaller than 5.0 cm ruptured during prospective follow-up. There was a statistically significant increase in expansion rate relative to size at entry, with the highest mean expansion rate of 0.52 cm/y for AAA 4.5 to 4.9 cm in diameter. There was no significant difference in AAA expansion rate between men and women. The frequency of surgery was inversely related to age at entry, but was positively related to AAA size at entry, with patients with AAA 4.5 to 4.9 cm at entry 6.8 times more likely (95% confidence interval, 4.3-10.7) to undergo surgery than those with AAA 3.0 to 3.4 cm at entry. Women were older than men at entry, and age at entry in those undergoing surgery was significantly greater in women.\nThe study confirms the results of the United Kingdom Small Aneurysm Trial and the Aneurysm Detection and Management Study, that is, that risk for rupture is extremely unlikely with AAA smaller than 5.0 cm, which enables safe follow-up surveillance programs in both men and women with AAA smaller than 5.0 cm.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the suitability for endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR) in an unselected patient population.\nBetween February 1999 and May 2002 all consecutive patients with a nonemergent abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) were prospectively examined with contrast material-enhanced spiral computed tomography (CT). Those patients probably suitable for EVAR on the basis of CT findings underwent calibrated angiography. A panel of radiologists and vascular surgeons reviewed the clinical data and vascular anatomy, and decided on the appropriateness of EVAR with the bifurcated Zenith AAA endovascular graft.\nOne hundred seven patients were included. Fifty-six patients (52%) had one or more contraindications for EVAR. Unsuitability was most frequently (88%) related to the proximal neck. Inadequate neck length was the most common specific reason. Inadequate iliac anatomy was the reason for unsuitability in 59% of patients. The rate of unsuitability decreased from 61% during the first half of the study to 40% during the second half (P =.03) Unsuitability was equal between men and women. Age and maximum diameter did not differ between candidates and noncandidates.\nAlmost half (48%) of patients with an infrarenal AAA referred to a primary referral center are suitable for EVAR with the bifurcated Zenith AAA endovascular graft. Neck anatomy was the most frequent reason for rejection. Rate of suitability increased over time, probably as a result of increasing experience. Suitability was not influenced by gender, age, or aneurysm size.",

    "abstract": "The need for cross-femoral bypass grafting (CFBG) is considered by some to be a major disadvantage of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with the aortomonoiliac technique. To determine the durability of CFBG in this setting, we examined data from 148 consecutive high-risk patients in a clinical trial of EVAR with a custom-made aortomonoiliac endovascular stent graft.\nAll data were collected prospectively. After hospital discharge, patients were evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 months and annually thereafter. All CFBG was constructed of expandable polytetrafluoroethylene.\nDuring follow-up averaging 23.6 +/- 16.2 months, nine CFBG complications developed in 8 patients (5.4%), including disruption (n = 2), infection (n = 3), thrombosis (n = 2), and pseudoaneurysm (n = 3). Four patients with CFBG complications died, of consequences of infection (n = 2), intracranial hemorrhage during attempted CFBG thrombolysis (n = 1), and intracranial hemorrhage during anticoagulation (n = 1). There were no amputations. At life table analysis, freedom from CFBG complication was 96.3% +/- 1.6% at 12 months, 94.1% +/- 2.2% at 24, 36, and 48 months, and 86.2% +/- 7.8% at 60 months.

Study subjects were patients at good surgical risk, aged 50 to 79 years, with AAAs 4.0 to 5.4 cm in diameter. Interventions included immediate open surgical AAA repair or imaging surveillance every 6 months with repair reserved for AAAs that became symptomatic or enlarged to 5.5 cm. Main outcome measures considered were SF-36 health status questionnaire, prevalence of impotence, and maximum activity level, which were determined at randomization and at all follow-up visits.\nEleven hundred thirty-six patients were randomized and followed up for 3.5 to 8 years (mean, 4.9 years). The two randomized groups did not differ significantly for most SF-36 scales at most times, but the immediate repair group scored higher overall in general health (P <.0001), which was particularly evident in the first 2 years after randomization, and slightly lower in vitality (P <.05). The baseline value of one SF-36 scale, physical functioning, was an independent predictor of mortality. Overall, more patients became impotent after randomization to immediate repair compared with surveillance (P <.03), but this difference did not become apparent until more than 1 year after randomization. Maximum activity level did not differ significantly between the two randomized groups, but decline over time was significantly greater in the immediate repair group (P <.02).\nFor most quality-of-life measures and times there was no difference between randomized groups. Immediate repair resulted in a higher prevalence of impotence more than 1 year after randomization, but was also associated with improved perception of general health in the first 2 years.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine the relative importance of surgeon specialty, hospital volume, and surgeon volume on outcome after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.\nData were reviewed for 3912 patients undergoing AAA repair in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample during 1997. In-hospital mortality was compared between high-volume hospitals and low-volume hospitals and between high-volume surgeons and low-volume surgeons. High-volume hospitals performed more than 35 AAA repairs per year, and high-volume surgeons performed more than 10 AAA repairs per year. Vascular, cardiac, and general surgery specialization was identified by analysis of other procedures performed by each surgeon.\nOverall, AAA repair mortality was 4.2%, and was lower at high-volume hospitals (3.0%) than at low-volume hospitals (5.5%) (P <.001). Lowest mortality was associated with operations performed by vascular surgeons (2.2%) compared with cardiac surgeons (4.0%) and general surgeons (5.5%) (P <.001). Mortality rates were also lower for high-volume hospitals (2.5%) compared with low-volume hospitals (5.6%) (P <.001). In a risk-adjusted analysis, high-volume hospital, vascular surgery specialty, and high-volume surgeon were all independently associated with lower risk of in-hospital mortality. In this analysis, risk reduction was 30% for high-volume hospitals (95% confidence interval [CI], 2%-51%; P <.05) and 40% for surgery by a high-volume surgeon (95% CI, 12%-60%; P =.01). AAA repair by general surgeons compared with vascular surgeons was associated with 76% greater risk for death (95% CI, 10%-190%; P =.02). No significant difference in mortality was found between cardiac and vascular surgeons.\nHigh surgeon volume and hospital volume of AAA repair were both associated with lower mortality compared with low-volume providers. Increased specialization in vascular surgery was associated with markedly decreased mortality independent of AAA repair volume. Health policy in support of selective referral for AAA repair should consider surgical specialization in addition to provider volume thresholds.",

In this analysis, risk reduction was 30% for high-volume hospitals (95% confidence interval [CI], 2%-51%; P <.05) and 40% for surgery by a high-volume surgeon (95% CI, 12%-60%; P =.01). AAA repair by general surgeons compared with vascular surgeons was associated with 76% greater risk for death (95% CI, 10%-190%; P =.02). No significant difference in mortality was found between cardiac and vascular surgeons.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trials of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) have required both preoperative aortography and computed tomography (CT). We codeveloped specialized three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction and computer-aided measurement, planning, and simulation software (3-D CAMPS) based on CT or magnetic resonance imaging, to eliminate the need for preoperative arteriography.\nEVAR with 3-D CAMPS as the sole preoperative imaging method was performed in 196 patients from 1996 to 2001, with six endograft types in three configurations. Physical examination, abdominal radiography, and CT (3D-CAMPS) were performed at 1, 6, and 12 months, then annually.\nFor a subset of cases in which a comparison could be made, 3-D CAMPS was superior to angiography for prediction of endograft length and iliac access. Hospital mortality was zero, and 30-day mortality was 0.5%. In three patients immediate conversion to open repair (1.5%) was necessary because of previously unknown stent-graft mechanical limits. Incidence of endoleak was 15% at 1 month, 10% at 6 months, 6% at 12 months, and 7% at 24 months, and 92% of endoleaks were type II. Mean follow-up was 18 months. Aneurysm-related mortality was zero. Nineteen secondary procedures (all endovascular) were performed in 16 patients (8%). For all graft types, freedom from secondary procedure was 94% at 1 year and 90% at 2 years, and this was better for endografts ultimately approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (96% at 1 year, 95% at 2 years; P =.02). No known measurement-related complications occurred in the series. Results for secondary intervention and endoleak compare favorably to series with similar endograft types.\nEVAR can be performed with 3-D CAMPS as the sole preoperative imaging method to achieve outcomes comparable to the best series published for each endograft type. CT with 3-D CAMPS can effectively eliminate the need for preoperative arteriography and avert associated morbidity, expense, and exposure to contrast agent and radiation.",

    "abstract": "Near-infrared spectroscopy provides a noninvasive method of measuring tissue oxygen saturation and has been used to monitor extremity compartment syndrome. Tissue O(2) saturation (StO(2)) is potentially useful in assessing patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The purposes of this feasibility study are to (1) explore the diagnostic sensitivity of StO(2) in subjects with PAD and symptoms of intermittent claudication (IC) compared with normal subjects, and (2) correlate the change in StO(2) during and after exercise with the ankle brachial index (ABI) in patients with IC. Material and methods Forty-nine subjects, 35 normal and 14 PAD, from two centers were evaluated in a prospective cross-sectional analysis comparing StO(2) by using the InSpectra tissue spectrometer and ABI at rest (baseline) and after treadmill exercise. Measurements were obtained at baseline and peak exercise (normal subjects) and at baseline, initial claudication distance (ICD) and absolute claudication distance (ACD) in PAD subjects. Endpoint values were the mean of 15 data points. Times to 50% of StO(2) recovery to baseline (T(50)) and complete recovery to baseline (T(100)) were measured. Receiver-operator characteristic curves were constructed to assess the sensitivity/specificity values associated with various StO(2) cut-points.\nThe PAD patients were older (P =.0002) and 57% were male, compared with 37% males in the normal group. The ABI was 0.68 +/- 0.14 in PAD patients versus 1.14 +/- 0.08 in normal subjects (P <.0001). The baseline StO(2) was 65% in both groups. The peak exercise StO(2) was significantly lower and the absolute change in StO(2) and the percent change in StO(2) were significantly greater in PAD patients (P < 0.45). The T(50) and T(100) were longer in the PAD patients compared to normal subjects (P =.0001 and.002, respectively). A T(50) of >70 seconds yielded a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 85% for PAD.\nStO(2) is a new and potentially useful technique to evaluate patients with PAD. Resting StO(2) was similar in PAD-IC subjects and normals. There was a significantly greater drop in StO(2) and longer recovery times in PAD-IC subjects. Interestingly, StO(2) at the ICD and ACD was similar. StO(2) offers a different and perhaps more appropriate end point for diagnosis and monitoring of the management of patients with PAD, and may offer additional insight into the pathophysiology of exercise-induced muscle ischemia and its recovery.",

    "abstract": "We compared results of angioplasty with those of concomitant stent placement to treat thrombosed forearm hemodialysis grafts with results for upper arm grafts.\nBetween October 1998 and July 2002, stents were deployed in 61 patients undergoing balloon angioplasty because of venous anastomotic stenosis causing graft thrombosis. Stents were used only in cases of inadequate angioplasty results. Twenty-three forearm grafts and 38 upper arm grafts were treated. All procedures were performed in an endovascular operating suite, with fistulography. Primary and secondary patency rates were analyzed and compared for graft location with the life table method.\nGrafts had undergone a mean of 1.56 previous revisions because of thrombosis (forearm: 1.52, upper arm: 1.58; P = NS). Excluding early thrombosis, a single graft infection was the only procedural complication. Cumulative primary patency rate at 3, 6, and 12 months (from stent placement) was 36.4%, 15.6%, and 0%, respectively, for forearm grafts, which was inferior to the 59.5%, 34.0%, and 17.0% primary patency rate observed for upper arm grafts (P =.0307) Secondary patency rate was 40.9%, 40.9%, and 30.7%, respectively, for forearm grafts, and 64.9%, 42.3%, and 19.7% for upper arm grafts (P = NS).\nStent deployment can salvage thrombosed dialysis grafts. However, sustained patency occurs infrequently, with better results for upper arm grafts than for forearm grafts. Inasmuch as surgical revision of forearm grafts is usually straightforward, stenting should be reserved for use in high axillary grafts and other sites where surgical repair is difficult.",

    "abstract": "Patients with lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) face a high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Platelet inhibition (PI) significantly reduces this risk. Combination PI is common and increasingly indicated in patients with PAD; however, the effect on platelet function has not been objectively evaluated. Aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel (Clop), and cilostazol (Cilo) are the three most commonly used PI drugs in patients with PAD. A prospective, sequential evaluation of platelet function using the template bleeding time (BT) was performed for PAD patients taking these medications singly and in combination.\nTwenty-one patients with PAD, averaging 65.9 years of age, were studied. Patients were placed on sequential two-week regimens of the following therapies: washout (no PI), ASA (325 mg daily), ASA + Cilo (100 mg twice daily), washout, Cilo, Cilo + Clop (75 mg each day), washout, Clop, Clop + ASA, and Clop + ASA + Cilo. At the end of each phase, trained personnel measured the BT.\nBaseline bleeding time for the group was 4.29 +/- 1.69 minutes. ASA (BT = 6.64 +/- 3.52) and Clop (BT = 10.17 +/- 5.4) significantly prolonged bleeding time (P < 0.01); however, no significant effect was observed with Cilo alone (BT = 5.41 +/- 2.69). Combined treatment with ASA + Clop (BT = 17.39 +/- 4.59) had a more pronounced effect on BT compared with either agent alone (P < 0.01). The addition of Cilo to either ASA (BT = 8.3 +/- 4.27) or Clop (BT = 12.7 +/- 7.46) or the combination of ASA + Clop (BT = 17.92 +/- 4.69) did not prolong BT.\nAll patients with PAD require platelet inhibition, and many require pharmacotherapy for intermittent claudication. The platelet inhibitors aspirin and clopidogrel are used for the reduction of ischemic events. They significantly prolong bleeding time individually and to a greater extent in combination. Cilo is used to improve walking distance in patients with intermittent claudication. When Cilo is added to ASA, Clop, or the combination of the two, there is no additional increase in bleeding time. Therefore, Cilo can be used in combination with other platelet inhibitors without an additional effect on platelet function as reflected by the bleeding time.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis and treatment of carotid artery disease is an integral part of stroke prevention. However, a population of patients who would benefit from screening for carotid artery stenosis has not been well defined. As part of an institutional stroke-screening program, a modified, rapid duplex scan was developed to evaluate patients for occult carotid stenosis. The goal of this study was to evaluate risk factors predictive of carotid stenosis in a selected population, and to identify patients who would benefit from carotid screening.\nPatients were eligible for the study if they were >60 years of age and had a history of hypertension, heart disease, current smoking, or family history of stroke. A modified carotid duplex scan that had been previously validated against formal duplex scanning was utilized; this involved visualization of the carotid bulb and proximal internal carotid artery where Doppler flow velocities were obtained and recorded.\nScreening was performed on 394 patients. Thirty-eight patients (9.6%) had either unilateral or bilateral carotid stenosis of > or =50%. Risk factors evaluated included smoking, hypertension, cardiac disease, or hypercholesterolemia. If none of these risk factors was present, the incidence of carotid stenosis was 1.8%. This increased to 5.8% with one risk factor, 13.5% with two risk factors, and 16.7% with three risk factors.

    "abstract": "The optimal management of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who have proximal subclavian artery stenosis (SAS) is not well established. SAS may lead to flow reversal through a patent in situ internal mammary artery graft, resulting in myocardial ischemia (coronary-subclavian steal). We review our experience in prevention and management of coronary-subclavian steal.\nThe medical records of patients who received treatment of symptomatic coronary-subclavian steal were reviewed. Patients who underwent subclavian artery revascularization before CABG were also included in our review. Patient demographic data, findings at presentation, imaging and treatment methods, and short-term and intermediate-term results were analyzed.\nOver 4 years, 14 patients with combined subclavian and coronary artery disease were identified. Nine patients had angina (n = 8) and/or congestive heart failure (n = 2) after CABG (post-CABG group). Four patients underwent treatment of SAS and one underwent treatment of recurrent stenosis before or during CABG (pre-CABG group). Among this pre-CABG group, one patient had symptoms of left arm claudication; the other four patients had no symptoms. A blood pressure gradient was commonly noted between both arms. An angiogram confirmed the proximal location of SAS in all patients, and established the presence of flow reversal in a patent internal mammary artery graft in the post-CABG group. Operative management consisted of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting of the subclavian lesion in 11 patients, PTA only in 2 patients, and carotid-subclavian bypass grafting in 1 patient. No known perioperative complications or morbidity was encountered in either group. Mean follow-up was 29 months, during which stenosis recurred in two patients, along with associated cardiac symptoms. In both patients repeat angioplasty was successful, for an assisted primary patency rate of 100%.\nPTA and stenting to treat SAS appears to provide effective protection from and treatment of coronary-subclavian steal over the short and intermediate terms. A surveillance program is essential because of the risk for recurrent stenosis. Continued follow-up is necessary to determine long-term efficacy of this treatment compared with more conventional surgical approaches.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the safety and assess the role of endovascular therapy in a variety of conditions related to celiac and mesenteric vascular occlusive disease. Patients and methods Our retrospective study population included 25 consecutive patients (mean age, 66 years), in whom 28 procedures were performed on 26 stenosed or occluded mesenteric vessels (superior mesenteric artery [SMA] or celiac artery [CA]). Indications included chronic mesenteric ischemia (21 patients), including 2 patients who underwent stenting prior to a planned operative repair of a juxtamesenteric AAA. Three liver transplantation patients underwent stenting of an associated CA stenosis. One patient with a splenorenal bypass underwent stenting on an associated CA stenosis. The technical and clinical success rates and the incidence of complications were determined. Follow-up parameters included maintained patency on duplex sonography and sustained clinical benefit. The need for additional interventions was noted.\nAll procedures but one were technically successful (96%). Major complications occurred in three patients (one transient contrast-induced nephrotoxicity and two pseudoaneurysms). Immediate clinical success was achieved in 22 patients (88%). The three clinical failures included two patients with an excellent angiographic outcome, but with single-vessel moderate severity disease. Survival table analysis of delayed clinical outcome showed primary and primary-assisted clinical benefits at 11 months of 85% and 91%, respectively. Primary and primary-assisted stent patencies, as assessed by duplex sonography and/or angiography, at 6 months were both 92%. Angiographically documented restenosis occurred in three patients. Restenosis in two patients with CA stents was due to extrinsic compression, and it was without symptoms in one patient and was treated satisfactorily by restenting in the other patient. Restenosis in one patient with an SMA stent was successfully treated by restenting.\nOur experience suggests a potential role for endovascular therapy of celiac and mesenteric arterial occlusive disease in a variety of clinical scenarios, with a low incidence of complications and a high technical success rate.",

Eight (6.6%) arteries had minor defects, including small kinks (4), mild residual stenoses (3), and small intimal flap (1). Ten (8.4%) arteries had major defects, consisting of hemodynamically significant residual stenoses (4), thrombus (2), kinks (2), bidirectional flow (1), and intimal flap (1). Major defects were successfully revised in all except three cases: two persistent mild stenoses and one bidirectional flow. Patients with abnormal IOUS at the end of the operation had increased incidence of graft-related complications and/or death (55.5% vs 7.8%; P =.004), early graft thrombosis (14.2% vs 1.0; P =.04), reintervention (21.4% vs 3.2%; P =.03), and graft-related death (33.3% vs 1.9%; P =.02), compared with patients with normal IOUS.\nThis study supports the routine use of IOUS during visceral revascularizations to optimize technical success and outcome. Persistent ultrasound scanning abnormalities are associated with risk of early graft failure, reintervention, and death. Patients with normal ultrasound scans can expect excellent results.",

This study analyzed a single center's experience with first-generation commercially produced thoracic stent grafts used to treat descending thoracic aortic aneurysms.\nOver 58 months 84 patients underwent endovascular stent-graft repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms; 22 patients received the Gore TAG stent graft, and 62 patients received the Talent thoracic endovascular stent-graft system. Each patient was enrolled in one of three distinct US Food and Drug Administration trials at Mount Sinai Medical Center in accordance with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, including suitability for open surgery, aneurysm anatomy, and presence of comorbid medical illness. Mean age of this cohort was 71 +/- 12 years. There were 54 men and 30 women, and 74 (88%) had three or more comorbid illnesses. Primary technical success was achieved in 76 patients (90%). Mean follow-up was 15 months (range, 0-52 months).\nSuccessful aneurysm exclusion was achieved in 69 patients (82%). Major procedure-related or device-related complications occurred in 32 patients (38%). There were six proximal attachment failures (8%), four distal attachment failures (6%), one intergraft failure (1%), two mechanical device failures (3%), five periprocedural deaths (6%), and five late aneurysm ruptures (6%). At 40 months, overall survival was 67% (+/-10%), and freedom from rupture or from type I or type III endoleak was 74% (+/-10%).\nWhile promising, this midterm experience with commercially available devices highlights the shortcomings of current stent-graft technology. Three significant advancements are required to fulfill the potential of this important treatment method: a stent graft with a durable proximal and distal fixation device, enhanced engineering to accommodate high thoracic aortic fatigue forces, and a mechanism to adapt to aortic arch and visceral segment branches to enable treatment of lesions that extend to or include these vessels.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the coexistence or later development of pararenal and infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in patients with thoracic aortic dissections.\nOne hundred forty-five patients (95 men, 50 women) encountered from 1992 to 2001 with thoracic aortic dissections-excluding those associated with trauma, those with Marfan's syndrome, and those with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms-were studied. The most common risk factors included hypertension (59%) and a history of tobacco use (52%). Type III dissections affected 86 patients (59%), and type I dissections affected the remaining 59 patients (41%). Aortic computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained annually. Data were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses.\nFive patients (3%) had a history of AAA repair prior to their thoracic aortic dissection diagnosis-3 were type III dissections and 2 were type I dissections. Twelve patient's (8%) AAAs were diagnosed with the initial CT study of their thoracic aortic dissection. Type III dissections accounted for all but one of these (11 of 12, 92%). Ten additional AAAs (7%) developed in the 128 patients with no initial evidence of an AAA being recognized from 1 to 48 months (average 16 months) after the thoracic aortic dissection was diagnosed. Type III dissections affected 8 of these 10 patients. Among the total 27 AAAs noted in this series, 74% (20 AAAs) were not continuous with the thoracic aortic dissection. In the univariate analysis, age (P =.0002), male gender (P =.044), history of smoking (P =.01), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P <.001), duration of dissection (P =.05), and presence of type III dissection (P =.009) were associated with the presence of an AAA. In the multivariate analysis, both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (odds ratio 5.4, 95% CI, 1.3 to 22.3; P =.02) and age (OR 1.06, 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.11; P =.004) were significant predictors of the development of AAAs.\nThis study documented that patients with thoracic aortic dissections are at risk to harbor or develop a later AAA. This finding supports the tenet that abdominal CTs or ultrasound scanning should be mandatory in the follow-up of patients with known thoracic aortic dissections.",

    "abstract": "Transcatheter embolization with coils and other agents has been described as a treatment method for type II endoleak after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). Type I endoleak has not been treated commonly with such therapies, although most investigators believe they warrant definitive intervention. The liquid adhesive n-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate (n-BCA) is often used to treat congenital arteriovenous malformations. The objective of this study is to report our initial experience in treating type I endoleak with n-BCA and with a variety of other interventions.\nA retrospective review was performed of 270 patients who underwent EVAR at our institution between January 1994 and December 2002. Of these, 24 patients had type I endoleak (8.9%), diagnosed either intraoperatively (n = 13, 52%) or during follow-up (n = 12, 48%). Among these 24 patients, 17 had proximal leaks and the remaining 8 patients had distal leaks. These cases form the focus of this study.\nTwenty-two leaks required endovascular intervention, with the following success rate: n-BCA, 12 of 13 cases (92.3%); extender cuffs, 4 of 5 cases (80%); coils with or without thrombin, 3 of 4 cases (75%). In one patient with persistent endoleak despite attempted endovascular intervention the device ultimately was surgically explanted, and the patient did well. Of six patients with endoleak initially managed expectantly, two eventually underwent attempts at definitive intervention, both with n-BCA. Three sealed spontaneously before definitive intervention could be performed; and in one 97-year-old patient who refused intervention, the aneurysm subsequently ruptured and the patient died. In total, 13 patients with type I endoleak underwent n-BCA transcatheter embolotherapy. No serious complications were directly related to this therapy. Colon ischemia developed in one patient, and was believed to be a result of thromboembolism during wire and catheter manipulation rather than n-BCA treatment. Twelve of these 13 leaks remain sealed at mean follow-up of 5.9 months (range, 0-19 months).\nOur initial use of n-BCA occlusion suggests that it may be an effective and safe method of treatment of type I endoleak after EVAR. In particular, n-BCA embolotherapy may be especially useful in treating type I endoleak not amenable to placement of extender cuffs. Larger case series and longer follow-up are needed before this treatment is more broadly recommended. Type I endoleak after EVAR can be treated successfully with a variety of endovascular methods, and surgical explantation is rarely required.",

    "abstract": "Poor outcomes have been reported with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in patients with hostile neck anatomy. Unsupported endografts with active fixation may offer certain advantages in this situation. We compared EVAR results using the Ancure (Guidant) endograft in patients with and without hostile neck anatomy.\nRecords of EVAR patients from October 1999 to July 2002 at a tertiary care hospital were retrospectively reviewed from a division database. Patients with elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair during the same period were reviewed to determine those unsuitable for EVAR. Hostile neck anatomy, assessed by computer tomography (CT) scans and angiograms, was defined as one or more of the following: (1) neck length </=10 mm, (2) focal bulge in the neck >3 mm, (3) >2-mm reverse taper within 1 cm below the renal arteries, (4) neck thrombus > or =50% of circumference, and (5) angulation > or =60 degrees within 3 cm below renals.\nThree hundred and twenty-two patients underwent EVAR with an average follow-up of 18 months. Patients in Phase II trials (n = 41), repaired with other graft types (n = 48), or without complete anatomic records (n = 27) were excluded. Demographics and co-morbidities were similar in the 115 good-neck (GN) and 91 bad-neck (BN) patients except for age (mean, 72.9 years GN vs 75.7 BN; P = 0.13), gender (11% female GN vs 22% BN; P =.04); neck length (mean, 21.8 mm GN vs 14.4 mm BN: P <.001), and angulation (mean, 22 degrees GN vs 40 degrees BN; (P <.001). Perioperative mortality (0 GN vs 1.1% BN), late mortality (5.2% GN vs 4.4% BN), all endoleaks (19.1% GN vs 17.6% BN), proximal endoleaks (0.8% GN vs 2.1% BN), and graft migration (0 for both groups) did not reach statistical significance. Neck anatomy precluded EVAR in 106 of 165 (64%) patients with open AAA.\nUnsupported endografts with active fixation can yield excellent results in treating many medically compromised patients with hostile neck anatomy. Nonetheless, an unsuitable neck remains the most frequent cause for open abdominal AAA.",

    "abstract": "Persistent aneurysm perfusion or endoleak is associated with pulsatility of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) after endovascular repair. However, the resultant pulsatile change in aneurysm diameter may be difficult to quantify, and therefore its significance is unknown. In this study cine magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was used to quantify aneurysm wall motion during the cardiac cycle and to correlate it with the presence and type of endoleak.\nCine MRA was performed in 16 patients undergoing endovascular repair of AAA. A 1.5 T magnet and post-processing with GEMS 4.0 Fiesta computerized video image analysis software were used to calculate maximum aortic diameter during systole and diastole. Changes in aortic diameter were determined from these measurements. Cine MRA was performed on aneurysms before treatment and in patients with and without endoleak after endovascular repair. Type of endoleak was confirmed at angiography in all cases. Four patients had antegrade (type I) endoleak, and eight patients had retrograde (type II) endoleak; no endoleak was present in four patients. Endovascular grafts with stent support throughout the entire length of the graft (Talent) were used in all cases (14 bifurcated grafts, 2 tube grafts).\nCine MRA demonstrated significantly greater wall motion and resultant change in aneurysm diameter in patients with type I endoleak compared with patients without endoleak (type I, 2.14 +/- 1.28 mm vs no endoleak, 0.12 +/- 0.09 mm, P =.001). Change in aneurysm diameter in patients with type II endoleak was not significantly greater than in patients with no endoleak (type II, 0.26 +/- 0.21 mm vs no endoleak, 0.12 +/- 0.09 mm, P = NS). Untreated aneurysms demonstrated the greatest change in diameter during the cardiac cycle (3.51 +/- 0.79 mm).\nCine MRA may be used to accurately quantify AAA wall motion before and after endovascular stent-graft treatment. The extent of change in diameter corresponds to the type of endoleak, with antegrade (type I) endoleak generating greater pulsatile change in diameter than retrograde-collateral (type II) endoleak or no endoleak. Cine MRA may provide a noninvasive means of assessing the success of endovascular treatment of AAA. Further studies will be necessary to confirm the utility and efficacy of cine MRA in postoperative assessment of endovascular aneurysm repair.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to compare both computed tomographic scan (CT) and color flow duplex ultrasound scanning (CDU) as surveillance modalities for clinically significant endoleaks and to evaluate concordance in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) diameter measurements in patients after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in a busy hospital vascular laboratory.\nWe conducted a retrospective review of all patients who underwent endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms between February 1996 and November 2002 and had same-day CT and CDU studies. Ninety-seven patients enrolled in phase II clinical studies of Ancure devices had long-term follow-up with both modalities. The other patients underwent simultaneous studies, usually only at the 1-month postoperative visit. Peripheral vascular studies were performed by two certified vascular technicians; all CT scans were reviewed by one vascular surgeon. CT was used as the standard against which the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of CDU in endoleak detection was determined. Statistics were performed by using the paired t test; a P value <.05 was considered significant. Kappa statistic was used to assess the correlation between CDU and CT in identifying endoleaks. The correlation between CT and CDU in AAA size measurements as well as in serial size measurements was also determined.\nFour hundred ninety-five same-day CT and CDU examinations were reviewed in 281 patients. Patients had an average follow-up of 34.6 months (range, 1 to 72 months). Thirty-five leaks were identified among the patients studied (12.4% overall). In comparison with CT, diagnosis of endoleak with ultrasound scanning was associated with a sensitivity of 42.9%, specificity of 96.0%, positive predictive value of 53.9%, and negative predictive value of 93.9%. The correlation between the two modalities was modest (kappa statistic 0.427). The minor axis transverse diameter as measured by ultrasound and CT scans (4.81 +/- 1.1 cm on CT and 4.55 +/- 1.1 cm on ultrasound) correlated closely (r =.93, P <.001.) Seventy percent of paired studies differed by < or =5 mm. Changes in aneurysm size throughout follow-up were -.29 +/-.71 cm on CT scan -.34 +/-.57 cm on duplex ultrasound scan. The correlation coefficient was.65 (P <.001). There was no significant difference in the change as measured by either modality on the paired t test.\nAlthough CDU demonstrates a high degree of correlation with CT scan in determining aneurysm size change over time, it has a low sensitivity and positive predictive value in endoleak detection. In the hospital vascular laboratory at a large tertiary care center, CDU cannot effectively replace CT scan in surveillance after EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Transrenal fixation (TFX) of aortic endografts is thought to increase the risk for renal infarction and impaired renal function. We studied the late effects of TFX on renal function and perfusion.\nOf 189 patients with commercial aortic endografts, which we inserted between 1995 and 2002, we reviewed data for 130 patients (112 men, 18 women) with available creatinine (Cr) concentration and contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans preoperatively and 1 to 97 months after the procedure. Of the 130 patients, 69 patients had TFX and 61 patients had infrarenal fixation (IFX). Both groups were physiologically comparable. Average age was 76 +/- 8 years for patients with TFX and 75 +/- 8 years for patients with IFX. Presence of renal infarct or renal artery occlusion was determined by nephrograms on serial contrast-enhanced CT scans.\nMean follow-up was 17 +/- 16 months (range, 1-54 months) for TFX and 21 +/- 21 months (range, 1-97 months) for IFX. Mean serum Cr concentration increased significantly during long-term follow-up in both groups (TFX, 1.3 +/- 0.5 mg/dL to 1.5 +/- 0.8 mg/dL, P <.01; IFX, 1.3 +/- 0.7 mg/dL to 1.4 +/- 0.8 mg/dL, P <.03). Creatinine clearance (CrCl) similarly decreased over long-term follow-up in both groups (TFX, 53.3 +/- 17.7 mL/min/1.73 m(2) to 47.9 +/- 16.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2), P <.01; IFX, 58.1 +/- 22.7 mL/min/1.73 m(2) to 53.1 +/- 23.4 mL/min/1.73 m(2), P <.02). There were no significant differences in the increase in Cr concentration (P =.19) or decrease in CrCl (P =.68) between TFX and IFX groups. Small renal infarcts were noted in four patients (5.8%) in the TFX group and one patient (1.6%) in the IFX group. No increase in Cr concentration or decrease in CrCl was noted in any patient with a renal infarct. Postoperative renal dysfunction developed in 7 of 69 patients (10.1%) in the TFX group and 7 of 61 patients (11.5%) in the IFX group. There were no statistically significant differences between groups with respect to number of patients with new renal infarcts (P =.37) or postoperative renal dysfunction (P =.81).\nThere is a slight increase in serum Cr concentration and decrease in CrCl after aortic endografting. However, there was no significant difference in these changes between patients with TFX and IFX. Although TFX may produce a higher incidence of small renal infarcts, these do not impair renal function. Thus our midterm results suggest that TFX can be performed safely, with no greater change in renal function than observed after IFX.",

    "abstract": "Blunt traumatic aortic transection remains a lethal condition. Treatment requires a high index of suspicion, prompt diagnosis, and expedient operative repair. Even in the best of circumstances, morbidity and mortality associated with open surgical repair are high, particularly because of frequent occurrence of other severe associated injuries. Endoluminal aortic stent-graft repair is an accepted treatment option in patients with aneurysm degeneration, and may be an alternative means of managing contained aortic transection. We describe three cases of blunt traumatic thoracic aortic transection treated with commercially available aortic endoluminal stent grafts.",

    "abstract": "Glycine has a protective effect in renal and skeletal muscle ischemia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of glycine in mesenteric ischemia and reperfusion injury in a rat model.\nTwenty-four anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 1 hour of mesenteric ischemia followed by 2 hours of reperfusion. Control animals received normal saline solution intravenously at 0.01 mL/g of body weight/h during ischemia and reperfusion. Treated animals received glycine at 0.5, 0.75, or 1.0 mg/g of body weight, dissolved in saline solution and infused at 0.01 mL/g/h for 2 hours. Animals were killed at the end of the experiment, and proximal, middle, and distal segments of the small bowel were isolated. Sections of the segments stained with hematoxylin-eosin were subjected to histologic examination (as per modified Chiu grading system) and morphometric analysis consisting of measurement of bowel wall, muscularis and mucosal thickness, epithelial coverage, and villar circumference. Isometric tension responses to electrical stimulation (10, 30, 50, 100 Hz), high doses of potassium (120 mmol/L), and carbachol (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0 micromol/L) were recorded in a multimuscle chamber. Statistical analysis was performed with unpaired t test and one-way analysis of variance.\nThe middle and distal segments of the small bowel in glycine-treated animals showed better histologic grade compared with saline solution-treated control rats (P <.05). At morphometric analysis, total thickness, mucosal thickness, and villar circumference ratio were well preserved in the middle and distal segments of the small bowel in the glycine-treated group (P <.05). No significant differences were observed in the proximal bowel segments between glycine-treated and control animals, because the proximal segment was not subjected to much ischemia. No differences were noted in percentage of epithelial coverage. Isometric tension responses evoked by electrical stimulation were greater (P <.05) in the middle and distal segments treated with glycine as compared with control segments. Carbachol-evoked contractions were stronger (P <.05) in the small bowel segments of animals treated with glycine. The responses evoked by 120 mmol/L of potassium were stronger in the distal segments of the small bowel in the glycine-treated group (P <.05). This cytoprotective effect of glycine was not dose-dependent.\nGlycine improved mucosal viability in the ischemia and reperfusion injury rat model. Mucosal thickness and villous circumference ratio were reliable objective parameters for evaluation of intestinal ischemia injury. Glycine improved the contractile responses of the bowel segments also, probably by altering the physiologic mechanisms underlying force generation. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of the cytoprotective action of glycine.",

    "abstract": "Our previous work demonstrated that angiogenesis is inhibited in nonhealing venous ulcers. The object of this study was to determine whether local expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other major regulators of vessel growth are related to healing of venous ulcers.\nThe study included 35 patients with venous ulcers (CEAP 6) and 9 patients whose ulcers had healed (CEAP 5). Control subjects were 18 patients undergoing routine operations (8 with closed suction drains, 10 standard skin biopsies). Healing ulcers were defined as having healed in less than a year from entry to the study; nonhealing ulcers failed to heal in this period. A 1-cm square biopsy specimen was taken from the edge of the ulcer or from a site of lipodermatosclerosis around a healed ulcer. Wound fluids were aspirated from beneath transparent occlusive dressings. Concentrations of VEGF(165) and VEGF-R1 were measured in tissue homogenates with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and results are expressed as mean +/- SEM per milligram of soluble protein (SP). Expression of mRNA transcripts for the VEGF splice variants VEGF(121), VEGF(189), and VEGF(165); the receptors VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2; the angiopoietins Ang-1 and Ang-2; and their receptor, Tie-2, were measured in biopsy samples with multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Expression of each transcript was normalized to that of the housekeeping gene, GAPDH. Results were analyzed with analysis of variance, t test, and chi(2) test.\nThere was no difference in VEGF(165) protein concentration between biopsy specimens from healing ulcers (2.12 +/- 0.34 ng/mg SP; n = 18) and nonhealing ulcers (2.36 +/- 0.39 ng/mg SP; n = 12), but concentration was higher in all ulcer samples compared with healthy skin (0.57 +/- 0.20 ng/mg SP; n = 10; P <.01)) and healed ulcers (0.33 +/- 0.06 ng/mg SP; n = 9; P <.01). Concentration of VEGF(165) protein in wound fluid was significantly higher in nonhealing venous ulcers (67.17 +/- 13.87 ng/mg SP; n = 13) compared with healing venous ulcers (32.19 +/- 7.90 ng/mg SP; n = 19; P <.05) or acute wounds (12.26 +/- 4.50; n = 8; P <.01). Concentration of VEGF-R1 was similar in wound fluid obtained from healing ulcers (7.18 +/- 1.34 ng/mg SP; n = 13) and nonhealing ulcers (7.02 +/- 1.21 ng/mg SP; n = 19), and acute wounds (7.12 +/- 2.35 ng/mg SP; n = 8). There was a weak but significant correlation between VEGF(165) protein concentration in the ulcer biopsy specimen and wound fluid from the same ulcer (R(2) = 0.2; P =.019; n = 27). Expression of mRNA for VEGF receptors and Tie-2 was poor. VEGF(121) was expressed in all samples, and VEGF(165) in 43 of 48 samples. mRNA expression of VEGF(189) (P =.001), Ang-1 (P =.002), and Ang-2 (P =.026) was found in more samples from unhealed ulcers than from other sites. Healed ulcers had reduced mRNA expression of VEGF(165) (0.181 +/- 0.003) than did healing ulcers (0.307 +/- 0.016; P =.007) or nonhealing ulcers (0.375 +/- 0.033; P =.001). Relative expression of VEGF(165) to Ang-2 was much lower in healed ulcers (0.4236 +/- 0.060) than in healing ulcers (1.382 +/- 0.235; P =.010) and nonhealing ulcers (1.887 +/- 0.280; P =.003).\nIn nonhealing venous ulcers there is a consistently high level of expression of VEGF, at both the gene transcript and protein level. As our previous data demonstrated that angiogenesis is depressed in these poorly healing ulcers, an increase in VEGF production may indicate an increased but ineffectual angiogenic drive. It is also possible that undiscovered inhibitors are released in the ulcer environment.",

As our previous data demonstrated that angiogenesis is depressed in these poorly healing ulcers, an increase in VEGF production may indicate an increased but ineffectual angiogenic drive.

    "abstract": "Venous hypertension leads to venous stasis ulcers. White cell activation, protein leakage from pressurized capillaries, and cytokine imbalances have all been implicated as indirect effects of venous hypertension that contribute to dermal changes seen in chronic venous insufficiency. The direct effect of increased tissue pressures on dermal elements has not been investigated. Prior studies have shown that fibroblasts isolated from venous ulcers have altered growth rates, morphologies, and protein production similar to senescent or aged fibroblasts. We hypothesize that neonatal fibroblasts (NNFs) cultured in conditions of increased atmospheric pressure will demonstrate altered cell function when compared with those grown at normal atmospheric pressure (ATM).\nA pressure incubator was used to culture populations of NNFs at ATM, 60 mm Hg over ATM (ATM + 60 mm Hg), and 120 mm Hg over ATM (ATM + 120 mm Hg). NNF population growth rates were determined by periodic flow cytometry analysis over a 2-week period. Light microscopy and digital imaging were used to evaluate cell morphology. Senescence-associated B-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) activity was determined using the X-Gal stain. Fibronectin production was assessed by exposing cells sequentially to anti-fibronectin antibodies and Oregon Green-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies. Flow cytometry then was used to determine relative proportions of cells staining positively for fibronectin. Statistical analysis was accomplished with analysis of variance.\nPopulations of cells grown under increased pressures (both ATM + 60 and ATM + 120) showed reduced growth rates (P <.001). Similarly, morphologies of cells grown under pressure had increased cytoplasm to nuclear ratios with abnormal nuclear shapes. Populations of cells grown under pressure had higher percentages of cells staining positive for fibronectin (ATM = 45%, ATM + 60 = 59%, ATM + 120 = 79%). After 14 days of growth under pressure, fibroblast populations did not demonstrate augmented productions of the senescence marker SA-beta-Gal (ATM =.5%, ATM + 60 =.25%, ATM + 120 =.75%).\nThis study demonstrated that NNFs grown in culture under increased pressures undergo a transformation not seen in cells grown at atmospheric pressure. Cells grown under pressure demonstrated reduced growth rates, increased fibronectin production, and abnormal morphologies similar to fibroblasts isolated from venous ulcers. This study suggests that pressure elevations (like venous hypertension) can directly result in altered cell function and morphology that may contribute to the delayed wound healing seen in patients with venous ulcers. This model uses a pressurized incubator that may prove to be a valuable adjunct in studying the effects of venous hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophil influx is one of the first events in a formed deep venous thrombosis (DVT), but whether these cells are active participants in the resolution process is not clear. This study tests the hypothesis that neutrophils (PMN) are active participants in DVT resolution.\nThrombosis was induced by inferior vena caval (IVC) ligation in male Sprague-Dawley rats, and rats were sacrificed at 2, 4, or 7 days for evaluation of the thrombus. Neutropenia was induced by rabbit anti-rat PMN serum, and controls received rabbit serum. Venography was performed at the 7-day time point. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to quantify intrathrombus PMNs and monocytes, and the myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay was performed to assess intrathrombus neutrophil activity. Intrathrombus concentrations of kerotinocyte cytokine (KC), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), gamma interferon inducible protein-10 (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were quantified by enzyme immunoassay at each time point and normalized to total protein. Total collagen was determined at day 7.\nPeripheral blood smears showed a 94% PMN reduction at 2 days (P <.05), recovering to 44% of control at 7 days. Intrathrombus PMNs were significantly lower in neutropenic rats at 2 and 4 days, but there were no differences in intrathrombus monocytes. The MPO assay confirmed reduced neutrophil activity at 4 days. Thrombi from neutropenic rats were larger at 2 and 7 days compared with controls. In vivo thrombus area at 7 days as assessed by venography was also greater in neutropenic rats as compared with controls. The intrathrombus KC concentration was increased more than 20-fold in the neutropenic rats at 2 days, but there were no significant differences in other intrathrombus chemokines. Finally, intrathrombus collagen was increased over threefold in neutropenic rats as compared with controls.\nNeutropenia impairs DVT resolution by several measures, most likely by altering normal fibrinolytic activity and thrombus collagen turnover.",

    "abstract": "P-selectin inhibition has been found to limit venous thrombosis. We hypothesize that elevated levels of P-selectin will amplify thrombosis, mediated by procoagulant microparticles (MPs).\nMale mice (Mus musculus, n659), 20 to 25 grams, underwent IVC ligation to induce thrombosis. Groups consisted of wild type (WT) C57BL/6 controls, mice with high circulating levels of soluble P-selectin (CT), P-selectin gene-interrupted knockout mice (PKO), and E- and P-selectin gene-interrupted mice (EPKO). Additional groups were used to evaluate the ability of a P-sel antagonist (rPSGL-Ig) and an antibody directed against PSGL-1 to downregulate the effects of P-sel in CT mice and WT mice administered soluble P-sel at time of thrombosis. Animals were sacrificed on days 2 and 6 after IVC ligation. Thrombus mass (TM), vein wall morphometrics, and serum leukocyte/platelet microparticles (MPs) were evaluated by means of double-stained fluorescence-activated cell scanning analysis, and soluble P- and E-sel protein determination by ELISA.\nAt days 2 and 6 in phase I of the experiment, significant differences (P <.01) in TM were noted between groups, with CT animals having the largest thrombi (50% and 57% increase in TM compared to WT at days 2 and 6) while EPKO mice had the smallest thrombi. Statistically, greater levels of neutrophils and total inflammatory cells were noted in the vein walls of CT animals at day 2 compared with WT and PKO animals. A significant difference was noted between CT and EPKO for neutrophils, monocytes, and total inflammatory cells, also at day 2. At day 6, the only statistically significant difference was found for monocytes, with a higher number in the CT animals than in WT animals. The evaluation of MPs revealed that the CT mice had a mixed leukocyte (MAC-1) and platelet (CD41) MP population that was also present in WT and PKO mice on day 2 and day 6. EPKO mice revealed a primarily platelet-derived MP population. Of interest, the CT mice with the highest TM showed a high amount of mean channel fluorescence for MAC-1 (phycoerythrin) antibody, indicative of leukocyte MPs. CT mice revealed statistically higher levels of soluble P-selectin at days 2 and 6. In phase 2, an antibody directed against PSGL-1 was more effective than rPSGL-Ig in decreasing TM and limiting leukocyte-derived MP fluorescence.\nThis study demonstrates that high circulating levels of P-selectin are associated with increased thrombosis, whereas a lack of P-selectin and E-selectin is associated with a lessening of thrombosis. Additionally, leukocyte MPs are associated with venous thrombus formation. These data suggest the importance of selectins to venous thrombogenesis and show that P-selectin and leukocyte-derived MPs should be good targets to limit venous thrombus formation.",

    "abstract": "Capillary perfusion and transmural pressure are delicately regulated by microvascular constriction mechanisms, which are activated upon a change in posture. Capillary flow is known to be disturbed in patients with severe peripheral arterial disease. To date, however, the influence of this disease on capillary pressure is unknown.\nCapillary pressure in the nail fold of the hallux, ankle, and toe blood pressures were measured in the sitting and supine positions in 8 patients with intermittent claudication (F2), in 7 patients with rest pain and/or ischemic ulcers (F3-4), and in 12 age-matched healthy controls (F0). Red blood cell velocity, laser Doppler flux, and continuous blood pressure of the second toe were measured simultaneously. Toe, ankle, and brachial pressure were measured after the experiment in both positions.\nCapillary pressure did not increase significantly with increasing disease severity (F0, F2, and F3-4) in supine (P =.37; medians, 17, 21, and 14 mm Hg, respectively) and sitting (P =.96; medians, 59, 60, and 60 mg Hg, respectively) positions, whereas toe systolic pressure did, both in supine (P <.001; medians, 91, 49, and 14 mm Hg, respectively) and sitting (140, 104, and 64 mm Hg, respectively) positions. Nutritive skin perfusion (red blood cell velocity) decreased with increasing disease severity (F0, F2, and F3-4) while supine (P =.005; medians,.19,.20, and.04 mm/s, respectively) and while sitting (P =.06; medians,.22,.15, and.04 mm/s, respectively).\nAn increase in orthostatic pressure increases both toe and capillary pressures. Arterial insufficiency of the leg seems to leave the capillary pressure unscathed. Apparently, arteriolar vasodilation compensates for the lower arterial pressure in both positions, even in patients with rest pain and low nutritive perfusion.",

We investigated normal blood flow values for age and sex in the common femoral artery and popliteal artery in 50 healthy volunteers. In addition, we examined reproducibility and determinants of blood flow.\nWe performed cardiac-triggered phase-contrast quantitative flow measurements in the common femoral artery and popliteal artery, and MRI of the calves in 50 healthy volunteers (age, 26-80 years). Ten persons underwent MRI three times, to analyze reproducibility.\nAll measurements were technically successful. Mean blood flow was 353 mL/min in the femoral artery and 61.9 mL/min in the popliteal artery. Coefficient of variation of femoral measurements was 16%, and of popliteal measurements was 19%. Femoral blood flow was significantly related to age and sex. Popliteal blood flow was significantly related to calf muscle volume, adjusted for age and sex.\nNormal values for blood flow to the legs are presented. The measurements have reasonable reproducibility. Blood flow to the legs depends on age, sex, and calf muscle volume.",

    "abstract": "Incidence of perioperative complications is increased and outcome is poor in young patients undergoing vascular surgery. We extensively reviewed results of lower-extremity procedures in this group of patients to further define the extent of short-term and long-term morbidity.\nResults from our vascular registry were retrospectively reviewed for 76 lower-extremity revascularization procedures performed between January 1990 and May 2000 in 51 patients younger than 40 years. This represents 1.88% of 4052 lower-extremity bypass procedures performed during this period. Perioperative cardiac complications, long-term survival, graft patency, and limb salvage were evaluated. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated, and their significance was determined with the Cox-Mantel test.\nForty-nine percent of patients were male, and 51% were female; mean age at presentation was 35.9 years (range, 27.5-39.8 years). Preoperative morbidity included diabetes mellitus (96.1%), smoking (70.6%), hypertension (78.4%), coronary artery disease (37.3%), hyperlipidemia (33.3%), and renal dysfunction (52.9%). Overall rate for 30-day postoperative mortality was 0.0%, for myocardial infarction was 0.0%, and for congestive heart failure was 1.32%. Thirty-day graft failure was 11.1% (n = 9). At 1 year, primary patency was 71.0%, secondary patency was 82.5%, and limb salvage was 87.1%; and at 5 years these rates were 51.9%, 63.4%, and 77.2%, respectively. After the initial surgery 11.8% (n = 6) of patients required at least one additional ipsilateral revascularization procedure, 31.3% (n = 16) required a bypass graft in the contralateral limb, and 23.5% (n = 12) ultimately required amputation. In patients who required additional ipsilateral procedures, 1-year primary patency rate was 66.7%, secondary patency rate was 62.5%, and limb salvage rate was 77.8%, compared with 5-year rates of 44.4%, 41.7%, and 64.8%, respectively, representing a decrease in patency compared with primary revascularization procedures. Overall survival at 1 year was 88.2%, compared with 73.3% at 5 years. Patients with preexisting renal disease had significantly decreased survival at 5 years compared with those without renal dysfunction (64.5% vs 82.6%; P =.019).\nOur data suggest that age younger than 40 years is not associated with increased perioperative morbidity and mortality. However, these patients have a significant rate of early graft failure and dismal long-term survival, especially in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction. In addition, ipsilateral repeat operations have a marginal success rate.",

    "abstract": "Some controversy exists as to whether polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is equivalent to reversed saphenous vein (SV) as bypass graft material for above-knee femoropopliteal revascularization. We compared the 5-year patency rate with reversed SV and PTFE grafts in patients with claudication who underwent bilateral above-knee femoropopliteal revascularization.\nBetween January 1994 and December 1997, 51 patients (102 limbs) with bilateral disabling claudication due to superficial femoral artery occlusion underwent above-knee femoropopliteal bypass grafting, with SV in one limb and PTFE graft in the other limb. Patients were randomly selected for sequential surgical treatment with either SV-PTFE or PTFE-SV. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate patency rate, and various factors were analyzed to ascertain any association with revascularization failure.\nThere was no perioperative (30 day) limb loss or death, but five late deaths (late survival rate, 90%). Mean follow-up was 59 months. In the SV group, three bypass grafts failed, requiring repeat operation in only one patient. In the PTFE group, eight bypass grafts failed, leading to five repeat operations. There was no statistically significant difference in primary \"assisted\" patency rate for the two grafts: 100%, 98%, and 94% for SV grafts, and 96%, 84%, and 84% for PTFE grafts (P =.09), after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively.\nThe overall results of this randomized study show that SV and PTFE grafts have a statistically comparable patency rate when used above the knee in patients with claudication. Use of SV, however, leads to fewer occlusions and repeat operations.",

    "abstract": "The consensus is that eversion carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a safe, effective, and durable surgical technique. Concern remains, however, regarding insertion of a shunt during the procedure. We studied the advisability of shunting with eversion CEA by comparing patients who underwent eversion CEA with and without shunting.\nOver 9 years, 624 primary eversion CEAs were performed in 580 selected patients to treat symptomatic (n = 398, 63.8%) and asymptomatic (n = 226, 36.2%) carotid lesions. All eversion CEAs were performed by the same surgeon (E.B.), with the patient under deep general anesthesia, with continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring for selective shunting, based exclusively on EEG changes consistent with cerebral ischemia. A Pruitt-Inahara shunt was used in 43 eversion CEAs (6.9%). All patients underwent postoperative duplex ultrasound scanning and clinical follow-up at 1, 6, and 12 months and once a year thereafter. Mean follow-up was 52 months (range, 3-91 months). The main end points were perioperative (30-day) stroke and death, and recurrent stenosis.\nNo perioperative death occurred in this series. Overall, ischemic perioperative stroke occurred in 4 of 624 patients (0.6%). Two strokes were minor and two were major. Only one (major) stroke occurred in the group with shunt insertion (1 of 43, 2.3%; P = not significant); the everted internal carotid artery was patent. Long-term follow-up was performed in all living patients. There was no late recurrent stenosis (>50%), and one late asymptomatic occlusive event occurred in the group without shunt insertion.\nShunt insertion can be safely performed during eversion CEA. Perioperative mortality and morbidity after eversion CEA are not statistically modified with shunting.",

CCDS was scheduled for the day before (day 0), the day after (day 1) and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after stenting. Development of ECA occlusive disease was evaluated with ECA-common carotid artery flow ratio (peak systolic velocity). For estimation of ECA stenosis 70% or greater, flow ratio 4.1 was used as the cutoff point.\nBefore and after stenting, two and three (one additional) ECA occlusions were seen. Median grade of ECA stenosis on day 1 did not significantly change at angiography (P = 1.0; tendency of increase) or CCDS (P =.27; tendency of decrease).At follow-up (day 1-24 months, CCDS only), frequency of stenosis 70% or greater in the ipsilateral ECA was 21 of 120 (17.5%) on day 1 and 41 of 107 (38.32%) at 24 months, and 3 of 107 (2.5%) and 5 of 107 (4.67%) ECA occlusions were registered at the two time points. Progression of disease, as demonstrated by increase in flow ratio over time, was much more pronounced in the ipsilateral ECAs compared with the contralateral ECAs (P =.0002).

Perioperative stroke (one major, four minor) occurred in 5 of 121 patients (4.46%). Two minor strokes caused by embolization occurred during the first year.\nThe more pronounced progression of arteriosclerotic disease at the orifice of the ipsilateral ECAs during the first year after carotid stenting might be due to local factors of the ICA stent. Its clinical significance in respect to the effect of the ECA as collateral supply to the brain might depend on the incidence of carotid stent rerecurrent stenosis, which was low in the present study.",

Primary indications for PCB were extensive atherosclerotic lesions (n = 45, 40.9%), carotid stenosis associated with kinking (n = 29, 26.4%), recurrent stenosis (n = 18, 16.4%), and stenosis after radiation therapy (n = 7, 6.4%).\nThe combined stroke and death rate at 30 days was 0.9%. Mean duration of follow-up was 647 +/- 71 days. Four carotid bypass grafts (3.6%) became occluded, and stenosis recurred in 1 (0.9%). At 3 years, overall actuarial survival was 81.4 +/- 11.5 and actuarial stroke-free rate was 97.7 +/- 2.3. There were no fatal strokes.\nPCB is a viable technique for treatment of extensive atherosclerotic carotid lesions, recurrent carotid stenosis, and carotid stenosis after radiation therapy. Postoperative stroke, occlusion, and recurrent stenosis rates are comparable to those associated with CEA performed under optimal conditions.",

Perioperative mortality was 2%, and death and stroke rate was 6%. Perioperative complications were associated with complex cardiovascular events, including hemorrhage after prosthetic patch infection, on-table thrombosis after endarterectomy, and synchronous carotid artery-cardiac reconstruction. One patient had a late ipsilateral stroke (10 months; normal scan). Cumulative stroke-free survival at 3 years (including operative events) was 91%. Cumulative freedom from recurrent stenosis greater than 70% or occlusion was 86% at 1 year and 83% at 3 years. Severe recurrent stenosis or occlusion developed in 7 patients, within 9 months of surgery in 6 patients and with 18 months in 1 patient. Angioplasty was performed without complication (no protection device, no stent) in 5 patients, 3 of whom required repeat angioplasty on at least one further occasion.\nIn common with venous conduits elsewhere, carotid artery bypass grafting with saphenous vein is associated with a high incidence of early graft stenosis. The long-term stroke risk, however, is low. Carotid artery bypass grafting is a safe and durable alternative when endarterectomy would prove hazardous or inadvisable, but regular surveillance is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence points to the inflammatory character of atherosclerosis, and several parameters of inflammation have been proposed as cardiovascular risk markers. We analyzed associations among serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentrations, carotid plaque structure, and immunocytology, and neurologic symptoms in patients with high-grade carotid stenosis.\nThis was a cross-sectional study in a referral center and institutional practice in hospitalized patients. The study included 62 patients with greater than 70% carotid stenosis treated surgically; 58% of patients had symptoms, and 42% did not. Serum hs-CRP concentrations were determined 48 hours before surgery; levels greater than 10 mg/L were considered pathologic. Histopathologic analysis (stable or unstable) and immunohistochemistry (macrophage count, T lymphocytes, activated T lymphocytes) were carried out on the atherosclerotic plaques.\nMedian hs-CRP values were 7.6 mg/L (range, 0-165 mg/L). Median hs-CRP concentrations were higher in patients with unstable plaque (53.2%) than in patients with stable plaque (46.7%): 27.1 mg/L (range, 1.8-165 mg/L) versus 4.1 mg/L (range, 0.3-56 mg/L) (P <.001). Among patients with symptomatic disease, 81% had CRP concentrations significantly higher than CRP concentrations in patients with asymptomatic disease (P <.001). A statistically significant association was found between hs-CRP levels and the presence of macrophages (Spearman rank correlation [rho], 0.61, P <.001) and T lymphocytes in the plaque (Spearman rank correlation [rho], 0.52, P <.001). At logistic regression analysis, neurologic event and macrophages in the plaque were independently associated with unstable plaque.\nIncreased hs-CRP levels may be related to the presence of macrophages and T lymphocytes in plaque, which is associated with the phenomena of instability that can lead to development of an ischemic event. Thus determination of circulating hs-CRP levels may be a useful additional marker of risk in patients with high-grade carotid stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Vascular surgery is traditionally considered a component of general surgery. There is growing evidence of improved patient outcome related to surgeon volume and vascular certification status. The American Board of Surgery in the United States, as well as until recently the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in Canada, requires that vascular surgery be considered an essential content area of general surgery training. This requirement is controversial. The purpose of this study was to describe experience and perceived competence in common vascular surgery procedures during general surgery residency training in Canada.\nThis web-based survey was conducted between January and June 2002. General surgery program directors (GSPDs), vascular surgeons involved in general surgery training programs (VSs), and senior general surgery residents (SRs) from the 13 English-speaking general surgery programs in Canada were surveyed. Questions were asked regarding which vascular surgery procedures are appropriate for general surgeons to perform, which procedures SRs are trained to perform, and which procedures SR intend to perform.\nThe response rate was 62% for GSPDs, 57% for VSs, and 45% for SRs. Overall, 49% of SRs did not intend to perform any vascular procedures after training. GSPDs, VSs, and SRs indicated that most SRs should be and are trained to perform varicose vein surgery, leg amputation, and femoral embolectomy (P >.05). In addition, GSPDs, VSs, and SRs indicated that SRs should not be and are not trained to perform infrainguinal bypass grafting, carotid endarterectomy, or abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (P >.05). There were significant differences with respect to ruptured AAA repair: 49% of SRs, 25% of PDs, and only 12% of VSs believe that general surgeons should be trained to perform ruptured AAA repair (P <.05). Overall, 76% of VSs believe SRs receive too little vascular training.\nThere is similarity between GSPDs, VSs, and SRs with respect to vascular surgery training in Canadian general surgery programs. Vascular surgery training cannot be considered a component of general surgery. More rotations or fellowship training is required to become competent in management of common vascular surgery procedures. Perhaps this level of competence should not be an objective of general surgery training.",

We compared outcome in patients at high risk because of anatomy (short or angulated neck), severe occlusive disease, or bilateral iliac aneurysms (group A) with outcome in patients at low risk (group B).\nPatients at high anatomic risk who underwent treatment between October 1998 and March 2002 with the Zenith endovascular graft (group A) were compared with patients at low anatomic risk enrolled in a prospective multicenter trial (group B). Variables compared included overall mortality, need for secondary interventions, development of endoleak, and change in aneurysm sac diameter. The chi(2) test, Student t test, and proportions analysis were used to assess the data.\nData for 493 patients (group A, 141; group B, 352) were evaluated. Mean follow-up was 9 months (range, 1-24 months). Perioperative mortality was similar for groups A and B (0.7% vs 1%). Frequency of endoleak was higher in patients with high-risk anatomy (25% vs 11%), but not significantly so (P >.06). The rate of aneurysm shrinkage, even in the absence of endoleak, was slower in group A (P <.05).\nIn physiologically challenged patients at higher anatomic risk for endovascular aneurysm repair, initial mortality rate is similar to that in patients at lower risk. Short-term technical results are acceptable. Decreased long-term survival (largely unrelated to the procedure), slightly higher frequency of endoleak, and a lower rate of sac shrinkage may temper enthusiasm for endovascular repair in this subgroup. Risks of repairing aneurysms in this patient population must be viewed in the context of expected results of intervention or medical observation.",

    "abstract": "In this prospective study we analyzed the immediate and midterm outcome in patients with abdominal aorta infection (mycotic aneurysm, prosthetic graft infection) managed by excision of the aneurysm or the infected vascular prosthesis and in situ replacement with a silver-coated polyester prosthesis.\nFrom January 2000 to December 2001, 27 consecutive patients (25 men, 2 women; mean age, 69 years) with an abdominal aortic infection were entered in the study at seven participating centers. Infection was managed with either total (n = 18) or partial (n = 6) excision of the infected aorta and in situ reconstruction with an InterGard Silver (IGS) collagen and silver acetate-coated polyester graft. Assessment of outcome was based on survival, limb salvage, persistent or recurrent infection, and prosthetic graft patency.\nTwenty-four patients had prosthetic graft infections, graft-duodenal fistula in 12 and graft-colonic fistula in 1; and the remaining 3 patients had primary aortic infections. Most organisms cultured were of low virulence. The IGS prosthesis was placed emergently in 11 patients (41%). Mean follow-up was 16.5 months (range, 3-30 months). Perioperative mortality was 15%; all four patients who died had a prosthetic graft infection. Actuarial survival at 24 months was 85%. No major amputations were noted in this series. Recurrent infection developed in only one patient (3.7%). Postoperative antibiotic therapy did not exceed 3 months, except in one patient. No incidence of prosthetic graft thrombosis was noted during follow-up.\nPreliminary results in this small series demonstrate favorable outcome with IGS grafts used to treat infection in abdominal aortic grafts and aneurysms caused by organisms with low virulence.

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to illustrate the safety of in situ reconstruction of septic aortic pseudoaneurysm (SAP) secondary to microbial aortitis, with or without long-term antibiotic treatment.\nData for patients with SAP (11 abdominal, 4 thoracic) operated on between 1993 and 1999 were reviewed. Computed tomography and aortography showed septic pseudoaneurysm in all patients before surgery. After diagnosis of SAP, all patients underwent aneurysm resection and extensive debridement, with in situ prosthetic grafting or patch repair angioplasty. The graft in 10 of the 11 patients with abdominal SAP was also wrapped with an omental pedicle. In vitro active parenteral antibiotic therapy was prescribed for all patients for at least 2 to 8 weeks after surgery.\nAll 15 patients had positive preoperative blood cultures or intraoperative tissue cultures for Salmonella spp (n = 12), viridans Streptococcus (n = 1), group G Streptococcus (n = 1), or Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1). There were two perioperative deaths (13.3%), one 6 days after surgery and the other 19 days after surgery, and two late deaths, at 8 and 10 months after surgery, neither of which was related to aortic repair. One patient was unavailable for follow-up. The other 10 patients have been regularly followed up with abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography (mean, 84 months; range, 47-118 months). To date, there has been no graft infection, thrombosis, false aneurysm, or subsequent aortic surgery in these 10 patients.\nSAP due to Salmonella and streptococcal microbial aortitis can be successfully treated with resection of the aneurysm and extensive debridement, followed by in situ prosthetic graft interposition or patch repair aortoplasty. This is a safe and effective treatment that may result in complete remission of SAP. Postoperative parenteral antibiotic therapy should be continued for 2 to 8 weeks. Although usually recommended, lifelong suppressive antibiotic therapy appears to be nonessential with this approach.",

We report our institution's recent 18-year experience with these aneurysms and review the literature.\nWe reviewed the records for 37 patients with visceral artery pseudoaneurysm evaluated at our institution from 1980 to 1998. From this group we found only 10 patients (27%) with splenic artery pseudoaneurysm. We also reviewed 147 cases of splenic artery pseudoaneurysm reported in the English literature.\nIn this series of 10 patients, 5 were men. Mean age was 51.2 years (range, 35-78 years). Causes of aneurysm included chronic pancreatitis in 4 patients, trauma in 2 patients, iatrogenic cause in 1 patient, and unknown cause in 3. The most common symptom was bleeding in 7 patients and abdominal or flank pain in 5 patients; 2 patients had no symptoms. Aneurysm diameter was known for four pseudoaneurysms, and ranged from 0.3 to 3 cm (mean, 1.7 cm). Splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy were performed in 4 patients, splenectomy alone in 2 patients, endovascular transcatheter embolization in 2 patients, and simple ligation in 1 patient. One patient with a ruptured pseudoaneurysm died before any intervention could be performed; there were no postoperative deaths. Follow-up data were available for 7 patients, with a mean of 46.3 months (range, 4.5-120 months).\nSplenic artery pseudoaneurysm is rare and usually is a complication of pancreatitis or trauma. Average aneurysm diameter in our series of 10 patients was smaller than previously reported (1.7 cm vs 5.0 cm). Although conservative management has produced excellent results in some reports, from our experience and the literature, we recommend repair of all splenic artery pseudoaneurysms.",

    "abstract": "We present a retrospective review of a single tertiary hospital experience in renal artery stent revascularization with distal protection in patients with ischemic nephropathy. The objectives of the study included preliminary assessment of the effect of distal protection on procedure-related acute deterioration in renal function and on renal salvage.\nAll patients had significant atherosclerotic main renal artery stenosis, documented at preprocedural imaging, and a degree of chronic renal impairment before revascularization. Forty-six renal arteries were treated in 37 patients with preprocedural renal impairment, which was mild in 10 patients, moderate in 19 patients, and severe in 8 patients. Median patient age was 72 years (range, 59-85 years). All patients underwent primary stenting of renal artery ostial stenoses with adjuvant use of a filter device (Angioguard guide wire system; Cordis Corp, Division of Johnson & Johnson, Miami, Fla) in the distal main renal artery. The filter baskets were recaptured for pathologic analysis.\nOverall, in 95% of patients, including all patients with preprocedural mild or moderate renal impairment, renal function was stabilized or improved after revascularization. In 5% of patients decline in renal function was unchanged. No patients had acute postprocedural deterioration. Mean follow-up was 12.5 months (range, 2-28 months). These results are better than in most reports in the literature and also better than in a historical group of similar patients with ischemic nephropathy who underwent stent revascularization without distal protection at the same institution. The improved results are thought to be due to prevention of cholesterol atheroembolization during the procedure by the distal filter baskets. Sixty-five percent of the distal protection baskets contained embolic material, including fresh thrombus, chronic thrombus, atheromatous fragments, and cholesterol clefts.\nA distal protection device may significantly improve results during stent revascularization. There are a number of unique demands on a renal protection device, and the ideal device has not yet been developed.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the blood flow changes and venous wall movements that occur in the perivalvular area during venous flow, to learn how these physiologic events influence the movements of the valve cusps, and to learn how the movements of the valve cusps influence the venous flow.\nTwenty healthy volunteers (10 male, 10 female, age 18 to 52) were subjects of this study. Each volunteer was examined in semi-recumbent and standing positions at rest and during active foot movements. Ultrasound examinations were performed in the B-flow mode supplemented by B-mode and pulsed-wave Doppler scanning.\nFour phases of the valve cycle are described. During the opening phase (0.27 +/- 0.05 s), the cusps move from the closed position toward the sinus wall. After reaching a certain point, the valves cease opening and enter the equilibrium phase. During this phase (0.65 +/- 0.08 s), the leading edges remain suspended in the flowing stream and undergo self-excited oscillations with an amplitude of 0.01 to 0.16 cm. During the closing phase (0.41 +/- 0.07 sec), the leaflets move synchronously toward the center of the vein. The subsequent closed phase has a duration of 0.45 +/- 0.05 seconds when the cusps remain closed. During the equilibrium phase, flow separation occurs at the leading edge of the cusp with reattachment at the wall of sinus. At this point, flow splits into two streams at each valve cusp. Part of the flow is directed into the sinus pocket behind the valve cusp, forming a vortex along the valve cusp before re-emerging in the main stream in the vein. When the valve is maximally open, the two cusps create a narrowing of the lumen about 35% smaller than the vein distal to the valve. In this narrowed area flow accelerates, forming a proximally directed jet.\nThe valve cusps undergo the four phases constituting the valve cycle. The local hemodynamic events, such as flow separation and reattachment, and vortical flow in the sinus play important roles in the valve operation. In addition to prevention of retrograde flow, the valve acts as a venous flow modulator. The vortical stream behind the valve cusps participates in the operation of the valve, and prevents stasis inside the valve pocket. The central jet possibly facilitates outflow.",

    "results": "Four phases of the valve cycle are described. During the opening phase (0.27 +/- 0.05 s), the cusps move from the closed position toward the sinus wall. After reaching a certain point, the valves cease opening and enter the equilibrium phase. During this phase (0.65 +/- 0.08 s), the leading edges remain suspended in the flowing stream and undergo self-excited oscillations with an amplitude of 0.01 to 0.16 cm. During the closing phase (0.41 +/- 0.07 sec), the leaflets move synchronously toward the center of the vein. The subsequent closed phase has a duration of 0.45 +/- 0.05 seconds when the cusps remain closed. During the equilibrium phase, flow separation occurs at the leading edge of the cusp with reattachment at the wall of sinus. At this point, flow splits into two streams at each valve cusp. Part of the flow is directed into the sinus pocket behind the valve cusp, forming a vortex along the valve cusp before re-emerging in the main stream in the vein. When the valve is maximally open, the two cusps create a narrowing of the lumen about 35% smaller than the vein distal to the valve. In this narrowed area flow accelerates, forming a proximally directed jet.",

    "abstract": "We recorded symptoms reported by patients with chronic venous disease (CVD) of the leg and correlated these with systemic inflammatory markers.\nThis was an observational study in a cohort of 132 adult patients with CVD attending the vascular clinic of a teaching hospital. Patients were excluded in whom recent surgery, illness, or concomitant medication may have influenced measurements of systemic inflammatory mediators. Patients with CEAP clinical stages C(2) to C(5) only were considered for inclusion in the study. CEAP clinical stage was established for each patient, and duplex ultrasound scanning was used to assess extent of venous disease in the lower limbs. Blood was taken from a foot vein, and the following inflammatory mediators were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: von Willebrand factor, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, soluble (s)E-selectin, sP-selectin, L-selectin, VEGF, and cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Symptoms were recorded by patients using a visual analog scale (VAS) for the symptoms of pain, cramps, heaviness, paresthesia, and feeling of swelling.\nThe greatest VAS symptom scores were observed in the less severe disease stages: C(2) median pain score, 2.8 units (interquartile range [IQR], 0.1-5); C(3), 4.5 (IQR, 3.4-5.5), C(4), 0.5 (IQR, 0-3.0); C(5), 0 (IQR, 0-4). Symptom scores were similar in patients with primary and recurrent venous disease after previous surgery and in patients with superficial venous reflux and deep venous reflux. No correlation was found between the measurements of inflammatory mediators and the symptoms assessed with the VAS.\nWe found no correlation between symptoms reported by patients and the internationally agreed clinical stages of venous disease of C(2) to C(5). Neither was there any correlation between levels of inflammatory mediators and patient symptoms. Symptoms reported by patients with CVD cannot be explained by anatomic distribution of venous disease in the lower limb veins or by the systemic inflammatory response in venous disease.",

    "abstract": "Superficial vein thrombosis may be complicated with venous thromboembolism. We examined factors predictive of venous thromboembolism in superficial vein thrombosis, which, to our knowledge, had not been prospectively studied before.\nWe performed post hoc analysis of the STENOX trial, a prospective randomized controlled trial that investigated various antithrombotic therapies in 427 hospitalized patients with objectively confirmed symptomatic isolated superficial vein thrombosis. The value of various baseline characteristics as predictive factors of venous thrombotic complications at 3 months was studied with logistic regression. Venous thrombotic complications were defined as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or recurrence or proximal extension of superficial vein thrombosis.\nVenous thrombotic complications occurred in 78 patients. Independent predictive factors for complications were superficial vein thrombosis of recent onset (odds ratio [OR], 3.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-6.27), severe chronic venous insufficiency (OR, 2.75; CI, 1.10-6.89), male gender (OR, 2.17; CI, 1.28-3.68), and history of venous thromboembolism (OR, 2.07; CI 1.06-4.04). Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism occurred in 19 patients. Only severe chronic venous insufficiency was an independent predictor of this complication (OR, 4.50; CI, 1.30-15.61).\nAfter symptomatic isolated superficial vein thrombosis, venous thrombotic complications are relatively frequent, and are more likely to occur in men, in patients with a history of venous thromboembolism or with severe chronic venous insufficiency, or in whom superficial vein thrombosis is recent. Knowledge of such predictive factors may be useful for determining appropriate treatment in patients with superficial vein thrombosis and for designing future phase III clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "We observed long-term venous ultrasound and plethysmographic changes after varicose vein surgery, to determine factors that influence recurrence.\nThis observational sequential prospective study was carried out in an institutional referral center with day surgery. Subjects were 92 consecutive patients, ages 20 to 75 years, with symptomatic varicose veins in 127 limbs, who were able to complete regular assessment. Superficial varicose vein surgery included significant perforator vessels only, defined at preoperative duplex ultrasound scanning and air plethysmography. Similar follow-up assessments were performed at 3 weeks, 3 months, and 1, 3, and 5 years.\nAt 3 weeks venous reflux but not muscle pump function was consistently improved in all limbs. However, inadequate surgery at the major junctions was clearly identified as contributing to recurrence of disease in 7.2% of limbs. Recurrence of varicose veins occurred in 1 of 100 limbs (1%) at the saphenofemoral junction and in 8 of 33 (25%) limbs at the saphenopopliteal junction. However, after 3 years disease recurrence at these sites had increased to 23% and 52%, respectively. Incompetent perforator vessels increased progressively in number. Clinical recurrence was 47.1%, and consistent with this was gradual deterioration in air plethysmographic measures of reflux, with physiologic recurrence (venous filling index, >2 mL/s) in 66% at 5 years. Late recurrence was predicted in limbs with multiple sites of reflux preoperatively, venous filling index greater than 2 mL/s, and some other persistent abnormality at duplex scanning at 3 weeks. There was no recurrence in 40 limbs in which these factors were normal at at 3 weeks. However, 29 of 53 limbs with normal venous filling index after operative intervention had deteriorated at 3 years.\nIncomplete superficial surgery, in particular at the saphenofemoral and saphenopopliteal junctions, is a less frequent cause of recurrent disease, and neovascular reconnection and persistent abnormal venous function are the major contributors to disease recurrence.",

    "abstract": "We undertook this study to determine whether additional use of selective venography, compared with nonselective venography alone, reveals more abnormal anatomic venous findings that lead to changes in vena cava filter (VCF) position.\nFrom January 1998 to June 2002, 94 patients underwent VCF placement by vascular surgeons at a university tertiary care center. Indications, techniques, decision analysis, and complications were reviewed. Nonselective venography and selective venography of the inferior vena cava (IVC) were evaluated for image quality, abnormal findings, aberrant anatomy, and the anatomic relationship of vertebral bodies to major venous tributaries.\nAbsolute and relative indications for VCF placement were 44% and 56%, respectively. Jugular, femoral, and subclavian vein approach was used in 47%, 47%, and 6% of patients, respectively. Seventy-three percent of VCFs were placed in the catheterization laboratory, 21% in the operating room, and 5% at the bedside. Nonselective venography was performed in 80 patients (85%), of whom 44% had undergone selective venography. At nonselective venography plus selective venography 7.5% of patients had an abnormal finding (IVC compression, n = 3; IVC thrombus, n = 2; tortuosity, n = 1). Similarly, 17.5% of patients had aberrant anatomy (accessory renal vein, n = 8; IVC duplication, n = 3; large low right gonadal vein, n = 2; megacava, n = 2). Nonselective venography plus selective venography demonstrated that 16% of VCFs required a major change in position, 10% of which were placed above the renal veins. Compared with nonselective venography alone, selective venography enabled detection of significantly more abnormal and aberrant findings (9% vs 49%; P <.001). Changes in VCF placement were necessary significantly more often in patients undergoing additional selective venography compared with nonselective venography alone (31% vs 4%; P =.003). In one patient in the series, a VCF was malpositioned in the iliac vein with intravascular ultrasound visualization.\nWhen nonselective venography plus selective venography were performed, 23% of patients had either an abnormal finding or aberrant anatomy, and most of these required a major change in VCF position. Nonselective venography plus selective venography redefines the criterion standard and, because of limitations of other methods of vena cava visualization for VCF deployment, should be performed in most patients.",

    "abstract": "Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices prevent lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis (LEDVT) when used properly, but compliance remains an issue. Devices are frequently discontinued when patients are out of bed, and they are rarely used in emergency departments. Trauma patients are at high risk for LEDVT; however, IPCs are underused in this population because of compliance limitations. The hypothesis of this study was that a new miniaturized, portable, battery-powered pneumatic compression device improves compliance in trauma patients over that provided by a standard device.\nThis was a prospective trial in which trauma patients (mean age, 46 years; revised trauma score, 11.7) were randomized to DVT prophylaxis with a standard calf-length sequential IPC device (SCD group) or a miniaturized sequential device (continuous enhanced-circulation therapy [CECT] group). The CECT device can be battery-operated for up to 6 hours and worn during ambulation. Timers attached to the devices, which recorded the time each device was applied to the legs and functioning, were used to quantify compliance. For each subject in each location during hospitalization, compliance rates were determined by dividing the number of minutes the device was functioning by the total minutes in that location. Compliance rates for all subjects were averaged in each location: emergency department, operating room, intensive care unit, and nursing ward.\nTotal compliance rate in the CECT group was significantly higher than in the SCD group (77.7% vs. 58.9%, P =.004). Compliance in the emergency department and nursing ward were also significantly greater with the CECT device (P =.002 and P =.008 respectively).\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that reduced compliance with IPC devices results in a higher incidence of LEDVT. Given its ability to improve compliance, the CECT may provide superior DVT prevention compared with that provided by standard devices.",

    "abstract": "To obtain a realistic overview of management and clinical outcomes of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) in Spain on the basis of data from a national multicenter registry.\nA prospective registry was initiated in Spain in March 2001. Data were collected from patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) and entered into the online registry by physicians who were responsible for the management of these patients.\nAs of August 2002, 4011 patients with confirmed VTE were included in the registry: 60% with DVT, 23% with PE, and 17% with both DVT and PE. Diagnostic methods for VTE included compression ultrasonography (86%), venography (10%), V/Q lung scans (42%), computed tomography scan (28%), and pulmonary angiography (0.9%). D-dimer testing was performed in 61% of cases and was positive in 92% of patients with confirmed VTE. The majority of DVT (95%) were located in the lower extremities (82% proximal and 4% bilateral), while 4.8% were located in the upper extremities or neck veins. Most patients (90.5%) were admitted to hospital. In the acute phase, treatment consisted of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in 88%, unfractionated heparin (UFH) in 11%, and fibrinolysis in 0.8%. Cava filters were inserted in 2% of patients, mainly because of active bleeding (13%), increased hemorrhagic risk (38%), or recurrent VTE (29%). Absolute bed rest was recommended to 63% of patients. Secondary prevention of VTE included oral anticoagulants (75%) and LMWH (24.5%). Therapeutic compression stockings were prescribed to 53% of patients at the time of hospital discharge. Regarding the main clinical outcomes during an average (+/-SD) follow-up period of 156 +/- 95 days, 19% had adverse events: 12.5% of patients died, 5.5% had clinically confirmed VTE recurrence, and 9.8% suffered bleeding complications (44% with major bleeding).\nThis prospective observational multicenter registry provides a large database reflecting the actual day-to-day clinical practice regarding VTE management in a European country. The most important findings were the increasing use of spiral computed tomography for PE diagnosis, the unexpectedly high proportion of patients admitted to hospital despite the use of LMWH in almost 90% of cases in the acute phase, and the utilization of LMWH for secondary prevention in almost 25% of cases. On the other hand, this large-scale prospective registry permits on-line consultation of high-risk situations to assess how difficult cases were treated and what their outcomes were. This will provide a most useful tool for the practicing physician responsible for the management of VTE patients.",

    "abstract": "The Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) has been proposed by the American Venous Forum as an objective means to clinically assess venous disease more completely than with the clinical CEAP classification. However, validation of the VCSS against an objective test is lacking. The purpose of this study was to test the VCSS against abnormalities found on venous ultrasound (US) scans.\nAs part of a screening project in a large kindred population with protein C deficiency, VCSS and venous US scanning were performed in 210 patients (420 limbs). A single examiner scored the VCSS (0-3) clinically for pain, varicose veins, edema, skin pigmentation, inflammation, induration, ulcer duration and size, and compressive therapy. Another experienced examiner, blinded to the subject's medical history, performed a US examination of the deep and superficial venous system, with a hand-carried US system. The relationship between US and VCSS scores was analyzed by calculating an odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI).\nOf the 420 limbs screened, VCSS was 0 in 283 limbs, and VCSS was 1 or greater in the following categories: pain, 63 limbs; varicose veins, 70 limbs; edema, 51 limbs; skin pigmentation, 17 limbs; inflammation, 2 limbs; induration, 8 limbs; and compressive therapy, 9 limbs. The highest total score in any limb was 8. A clear association was seen with the VCSS and abnormalities found on US scans. When the score was dichotomized (0 = normal, 1 = any abnormality), it was a strong predictor of US scan abnormalities; limbs with VCSS greater than 0 had a 26-fold greater chance of US scan abnormalities than did limbs with VCSS = 0 (OR, 26.5; 95% CI, 11-64). With ultrasonography as the standard, sensitivity of VCSS compared with US scans was 89.3%, and specificity was 76.1%. Negative predictive value of VCSS = 0 was 97.9%, and positive predictive value for any positive score was 36.5%\nThe results of this study are based on a large kindred population with a higher risk for venous disease than found in the general population. Though the VCSS was devised to quantify the severity of chronic venous disease, this study found it a useful screening tool. The VCSS showed good association with abnormalities on US scans, and when VCSS = 0 there is a high likelihood that the patient does not have venous disease. This simple test may prove valuable in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism, which in turn is a major cause of chronic venous insufficiency. HHcy may be more common in patients with chronic venous insufficiency, but the cause is unknown.\nOne hundred hospital outpatients (52 women; median age, 66.5 years [interquartile range, 53-77 years] with venous disease C(2-6) underwent assessment of serum vitamin B(12) and folate concentration, plasma Hcy concentration, and C677T methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHR) homozygosity with polymerase chain reaction. HHcy was defined as greater than 15 micromol/L, the 95th centile of the normal range.\nCEAP classification was C(2) in 39 patients, C(3) in 10 patients, C(4) in 13 patients, C(5) in 15 patients, and C(6) in 23 patients, with median Hcy concentration 11.6, 11.5, 12.5, 15.1, and 18.1 micromol/L, respectively (Kruskall-Wallis test, P <.001). Overall prevalence of HHcy was 39% (P <.001, binomial test vs normal population), and was significantly related (Pearson chi(2) for trend, 13.616; P <.009) to clinical grade: C(2), 23%; C(3), 20%; C(4), 39%; C(5), 53%; C(6), 65%. In a linear regression model, C(6) disease was a strong independent predictor (R(2) = 20.1%) for Hcy. Overall, 5 of 49 patients (10%, NS compared with normal population [5%]) with C(2-3) disease and 10 of 51 patients (20%) (P <.001, binomial test) with C(4-6) disease were homozygous for the C677T MTHFR polymorphism. Hcy levels and prevalence of HHcy were negatively correlated with vitamin B(12) levels (r = -0.248, P =.021, and r = -0.225;, P =.037, respectively). There was no significant relationship with folate. HHcy was present in 3 patients (all with C(5-6) disease) with either vitamin B(12) or folate deficiency, and in 8 of 15 patients homozygous for MTHFR C677T. No patient had HHcy, vitamin deficiency, and C677T mutation.\nHHcy is common in patients with chronic venous insufficiency, especially those with ulceration. However, inasmuch as fewer than a third of patients with HHcy were C677T MTHFR homozygous or had vitamin B(12) or folate deficiency, other mechanisms must be responsible in the majority. Further work is required to determine the cause of HHcy in chronic venous insufficiency, whether HHcy is causally related to development and progression of the disease, and whether treatment would be beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Postsclerotherapy pigmentation occurs in nearly 30% of patients. Hemosiderin, from degradation of the venous thrombus, is the possible cause. The hypothesis that early removal of the thrombus may eliminate or decrease the incidence of pigmentation has not been proved or documented. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of early microthrombectomy on incidence of postsclerotherapy pigmentation.\nThis multicenter, randomized, controlled study involved 101 patients with varicose veins (100 women, 1 man; mean age, 46 years [range, 25-68 years]). Patients were divided into two groups, with veins 1 mm or less in diameter (group 1, n = 50) or veins 3 mm or less in diameter (group 2, n = 51). Group 1 was treated with Sotradecol (STD) 0.25%, and group 2 with STD 0.50%. In each patient, an area of varicosities was selected and divided into halves. One half was randomized to microthrombectomy and the other half served as control. Microthrombectomy was performed 1 to 3 weeks after treatment in the randomized half. Standard photographs were obtained before and 16 weeks after treatment, and were evaluated by three independent reviewers who were blinded to treatment assignments. Each reviewer received an identical set of pretreatment and posttreatment 10 x 15-cm color photographs of the study area, and completed a scoring sheet. Average of the scores was used to evaluate primary (pigmentation) and secondary (overall clinical improvement) end points. The paired t test and chi-square test were used for statistical analysis.\nIn group 1, microthrombectomized areas had statistically significant less pigmentation (P =.0047) and better overall clinical improvement scores (P =.0002) compared with the control side. In group 2 there was no significant difference between the two areas, but patients reported significant relief of pain and inflammation associated with postsclerotherapy thrombophlebitis.\nIn veins 1 mm or smaller, microthrombectomy reduced pigmentation and improved overall clinical results. In veins 3 mm or smaller, statistical significance was not achieved, but thrombectomy resulted in faster resolution of the postsclerotherapy pain and inflammation. On the basis of these results, microthrombectomy after sclerotherapy is recommended.",

    "abstract": "We investigated whether routine ligation of incompetent perforator veins is necessary in treatment of symptomatic chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) due to combined superficial and perforator vein incompetence, without deep venous insufficiency.\nThis was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data. Twenty-four limbs with both superficial and perforator venous incompetence but no deep venous insufficiency were identified at venous duplex scanning. Air plethysmography (APG) was performed preoperatively, to obtain venous volume (VV), venous filling index (VFI), ejection fraction (EF), and residual volume fraction (RVF) of the affected limb. Saphenous vein stripping from the groin to knee and powered transilluminated phlebectomy for varicosity ablation were performed in all patients. Postoperatively, all patients underwent duplex scanning and APG to determine the status of the perforator veins and hemodynamic improvement from surgery.\nAverage patient age was 55.8 years; 62% of patients were women. CVI was class 3 in 4 limbs, class 4 in 12 limbs, and class 5 and class 6 in 4 limbs each. Postoperative duplex scans demonstrated that 71% of previously incompetent perforator vessels were now competent or absent. Significant improvement in all APG values was documented after superficial surgery. VFI improved from 6.0 +/- 2.9 preoperatively to 2.2 +/- 1.3 after surgery (P <.001); EF improved from 56.3 +/- 18 to 62 +/- 21 (P =.02); and RVF improved from 40.1 +/- 19 to 28.3 +/- 18 (P =.009). Mean preoperative symptom score (5.3 +/- 1.9) was significantly improved at mean follow-up of 18.3 months (1.4 +/- 1.2; P <.001).\nPatients with superficial and perforator vein incompetence and a normal deep venous system experienced significant improvement in APG-measured hemodynamic parameters and clinical symptom score after superficial ablative surgery alone. This suggests that ligation of the perforator veins can be reserved for patients with persistent incompetent perforator vessels, with abnormal hemodynamic parameters or continued symptoms after superficial ablative surgery.",

    "abstract": "Saphenous nerve injury has long been recognized as a risk of greater saphenous vein stripping, and it has been suggested by some authors as a reason to avoid stripping below the knee. The rate of injury reported in the literature is extremely variable, with no study adequately addressing the effect of these injuries on patient quality of life. We undertook this study to measure the prevalence of these injuries and quantify their impact on quality of life.\nA cross-sectional study of patients who had undergone primary greater saphenous vein stripping to the ankle was performed. Patients who had undergone this procedure, performed in a downward manner by a single surgeon over a 12-year period, were contacted and asked to return for a follow-up examination. Subjects completed the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Symptom Severity Score as well as a questionnaire designed to identify symptoms of saphenous nerve injury and any effects on quality of life. They were then evaluated for saphenous nerve deficits with simple neurologic tests. Charts were reviewed to determine preoperative CEAP classification. Results were analyzed for statistically significant differences between groups.\nOut of 111 patients (127 legs) who had undergone the procedure, 38 (34%) agreed to participate in the study. Three of these patients were ultimately excluded because of an inability to obtain a reliable neurologic examination of the legs, leaving 35 patients with a total of 45 legs operated. Participants did not differ from the potential study population in demographic data, follow-up interval, or preoperative CEAP classification. Median time since operation was 4.5 years (range, 8 months to 10.75 years). Overall, 40% of patients reported symptoms consistent with saphenous nerve injury at some time after operation, but these symptoms affected quality of life in only 6.7%. Symptoms persisted at evaluation in 17.8%, and only one patient (2.3%) reported any negative effect on quality of life at the time of examination. Saphenous nerve deficits were identified in 58% of patients. Patients with deficits had no statistically significant differences from those without deficits in terms of demographic data, follow-up interval, preoperative CEAP class, or Aberdeen score.\nSigns and symptoms of saphenous nerve injury are common at long-term follow-up after greater saphenous vein stripping to the ankle. However, there appears to be little, if any, significant resultant morbidity. The risk of saphenous nerve injury should therefore not be considered a reason to avoid stripping of the greater saphenous vein to the ankle.",

    "abstract": "To assess the importance of iliac venous outflow obstruction in limbs with and without concomitant deep or superficial reflux, we performed a retrospective analysis of data contemporaneously entered into a set time-stamped electronic medical records program.\nFour hundred forty-seven limbs underwent iliac vein stenting of chronic, nonmalignant obstruction when greater than 50% morphologic stenosis was found at transfemoral venography or intravascular ultrasonography. Group 1 (female-male ratio, 3.4:1; left limb-right limb, 2.7:1; nonthrombotic-thrombotic, 1.8:1) included 187 stented limbs in 176 patients with absence of deep and superficial reflux as identified at erect duplex Doppler scanning. Group 2 (female-male, 1.7:1; left-right, 1.9:1, nonthrombotic-thrombotic limb, 1:2.1) included 260 limbs in 253 patients with combination obstruction and reflux. Reflux was left untreated during the observation period. Clinical outcome (ulcer healing and recurrence rate, degree of pain per visual analog scale, swelling grade) and hemodynamic effects (ambulatory venous pressure, venous refilling time, venous filling index at 90 seconds) of iliac venous stenting were assessed.\nPatients with reflux and obstruction had more severe disease (clinical class 4-6, 53% in group 2 vs 24% in group 1; P <.001). Similarly, rate of active ulcer was low in limbs with obstruction only (3% vs 24%, groups 1 and 2, respectively). Mean clinical follow-up was 13 +/- 12 months (SD) in 86% of limbs. Because of the presence of reflux in group 2, venous pressure was higher, venous filling time was shorter, and venous filling index at 90 seconds increased, compared with group 1. Multisegment scores were 2.6 +/- 1.6 and 0, respectively. Of greater interest, there was no deterioration in venous hemodynamics in group 2 after stenting. There was substantial clinical improvement in both groups after stenting. Approximately half of patients were completely relieved of pain after stenting, and a third were completely relieved of swelling. In addition, 55% of ulcerated limbs healed.\nIliac venous outflow obstruction appears to have an important role in clinical expression of chronic venous insufficiency, particularly in producing pain, and is easily overlooked, mainly because of diagnostic difficulty. The combination of reflux and obstruction is seen more frequently with severe clinical disease than is obstruction alone. Ulcer prevalence is clearly associated with reflux, with a low incidence in patients with obstruction alone. Removal of iliac vein outflow obstruction does not result in increased axial reflux, with clinical deterioration in limbs with combined reflux and obstruction.",

The combination of conventional surgery and endovascular repair may allow for successful treatment in patients with anatomy unsuitable for repair entirely by endovascular means alone. We present the case of a patient with a syphilitic thoracic aortic aneurysm involving the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. He underwent a staged repair with an elephant trunk reconstruction of the aortic arch followed by endovascular repair of the descending thoracic aorta.

Access to the thoracic aorta can occasionally be challenging because of large device size and vessel tortuosity. Traditional access by way of the femoroiliac vessels might not be possible in the setting of synchronous iliac occlusive disease.\nA 63-year-old woman presented with a 7.1-cm symptomatic, penetrating ulcer of the descending thoracic aorta. The patient's severe pulmonary disease prohibited an open repair. A Talent endoprosthesis was placed under compassionate use with approval of the institutional review board. The graft was placed by way of the left common carotid artery because of severe iliac occlusive disease.\nThe thoracic endograft was successfully placed with exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm. The patient's chest pain resolved immediately. She developed mild left-sided weakness from a postoperative right anterior cerebral artery stroke that quickly resolved. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 5. No aortic endoleak was noted on follow-up computerized tomography scan at 1 month.\nEndovascular repair should be considered in patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms, particularly those with severe medical comorbidities. Placement by way of the common carotid artery is technically feasible in the setting of synchronous aortoiliac disease.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of aortic prosthetic graft infections remains a challenge. One frequently encountered technical difficulty when removing an infected prosthetic aortic graft is how to close a short, friable remnant aortic stump. We present three case reports in which we used a layer of posterior rectus fascia-peritoneum to bolster oversewing a short infected aortic stump after removal of an infected aortic graft. All three patients underwent staged extra-anatomic axillary-to-femoral artery bypass procedures, with subsequent removal of the infected aortic graft as a second operation. Two of the three procedures were semi-elective, and one was done urgently because of a recurrent aortoenteric fistula. All three patients had less than 1 cm of remaining aortic neck below the renal arteries for closure. In each instance a segment of autogenous posterior rectus fascia-peritoneum was harvested and used as a circumferential pledget to bolster the anastomosis. No patient had stump blowout, and in no case was there computed tomography evidence of aneurysmal enlargement of the stump with follow-up of 12 and 24 months in two of the three survivors. Use of autogenous fascia-peritoneum is a durable and effective method to assist stump closure and prevent stump blowout after removal of infected aortic grafts.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) is important in regulation of platelet aggregation, endothelial function, and intravascular thrombosis. The purposes of this study were to assess the effect of thrombolysis on endothelial function in a porcine model of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and to evaluate the effect of NO precursor l-arginine on endothelial function after thrombolytic therapy.\nDVT was created in bilateral iliac veins by deploying a self-expanding stent-graft that incorporated an intraluminal stenosis, from a groin approach. Five pigs underwent sham operation. After 7 days of DVT, animals were randomized to three groups: saline pulse-spray (saline group, n = 5), thrombolytic pulse-spray with tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase, 8 mg; t-PA group, n = 5), and thrombolytic pulse-spray plus intravenous l-arginine (20 mmol/L; arginine group, n = 5). At 2 weeks iliac vein patency was evaluated at venography and intravascular ultrasound scanning. NO level was determined with a chemiluminescent assay of the nitrite and nitrate metabolites (NO(x)). Thrombogenicity was evaluated with radiolabeled platelet and fibrin deposition. Veins were harvested and evaluated with light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Endothelial function was evaluated with organ chamber analysis.\nAll iliac veins remained patent at 2 weeks. The luminal areas in the sham, saline, t-PA, and arginine groups were 53 +/- 23 mm(2), 14 +/- 11 mm(2), 34 +/- 19 mm(2), and 42 +/- 21 mm(2), respectively. No difference in endothelial cell structure was observed between the three treatment groups at light microscopy or scanning electron microscopy. Although no difference in fibrin deposition was noted among the three treatment groups, decreased platelet deposition occurred in the arginine group compared with the saline or t-PA groups (P <.05). The arginine group showed greater endothelial-dependent relaxation compared with the t-PA or saline groups (73% +/- 23% vs 49% +/- 18% and 32% +/- 21%; P <.05). Local NO(x) level in the arginine group was correspondingly higher compared with the saline or t-PA groups (1.8 +/- 0.3 micromol/L vs 0.3 +/- 0.05 micromol/L and 0.2 +/- 0.04 micromol/L; P <.05).\nNO precursor l-arginine supplementation enhances NO production at sites of venous thrombosis. Moreover, l-arginine preserves endothelial vasoreactivity and reduces platelet deposition after thrombolysis in iliac DVT. These data suggest that l-arginine may preserve endothelial function after thrombolysis and may reduce the likelihood of postthrombotic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "We investigated whether differences in cellular composition of the shoulder region of carotid plaque, a cell-rich, debris-free area, can be revealed with computer-driven analysis of ultrasound scans.\nIn 26 patients referred for carotid endarterectomy, the shoulder region of plaque eligible for surgical removal was identified with ultrasound scanning. Digital images were obtained and evaluated with a specially developed computer-driven system (Medical Image Processing [MIP]). The gray level distribution of the region of interest (ROI), along with some statistical parameters exploring the spatial distribution of pixels, such as entropy and second angular moment, were analyzed. In the specimen retrieved at surgery, the area corresponding to the ROI was selected. Cryosections were tested at immunocytochemistry with monoclonal antibodies specific to smooth muscle cells (SMCs), macrophages), and lymphocytes. Computerized image analysis was performed to quantify each cellular component of the lesion.\nMean gray levels were related positively to the content of SMCs (r = 0.576, P =.002) and negatively to the content of macrophages (r = -0.555, P =.003). Lymphocytes did not show any correlation. Prevalence of SMCs, expressed as the ratio SMC/(SMC + macrophages), was related positively with entropy (r = 0.517, P =.007) and negatively with the second angular moment (r = -0.422, P =.032). The quartiles of gray level were useful for detecting significant differences in terms of cellular composition.\nSome cellular features of the shoulder region of plaque are associated with specific videodensitometric patterns evaluated with MIP. This approach enables in vivo noninvasive prediction and monitoring of cell composition of the shoulder region, and could be extended to study of the thickened intima.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to reexamine the possibility that bacteria, particularly anaerobes, are present in aortic aneurysms.\nFrom December 2000 to November 2001, 53 samples from aneurysm walls were collected from 49 patients during reconstructive surgery. The tissue specimens were sectioned and cultured under anaerobic conditions. Twenty-eight specimens were also subjected to scanning or transmission electron microscopy.\nAnaerobic cultivation yielded bacteria in 14 of the 53 samples (26.4%). All bacteria were gram-positive cocci or rods from nine genera and 12 species. Five cultures (35%) were mixed, containing two bacterial species. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic species were found in four samples (28.5%). Anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 10 of 14 positive cultures (71%). Among anaerobes found were Propionibacterium acnes, Propionibacterium granulosum, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Eggerthella lenta. Coaggregating bacteria of different sizes and structure were found on the aneurysm walls and inside the intravascular plaque at electron microscopy. Bacteria were found in 20 of the 28 samples (71%) examined with scanning or transmission electron microscopy.\nMultiple bacteria, many of which did not belong to the indigenous skin microflora, colonize aortic aneurysms. It is not clear whether the bacteria contribute to weakening of the aortic wall by eliciting inflammation or whether they are secondary colonizers of aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Degradation of the extracellular matrix components elastin and collagen has been implicated in vascular diseases, including abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is involved in these disease processes. Our previous studies have demonstrated that MMP-2 derived from mesenchymal cells is required for aneurysm development in a murine model. Doxycycline is a nonspecific inhibitor of MMPs. In the present study, the mechanisms of the inhibitory effects of doxycycline on MMP-2 expression from cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and human aortic aneurysm tissue explants were studied. Doxycycline inhibited MMP-2 expression from cultured SMCs in a concentration-dependent manner (5-40 microg/mL; inhibitory concentration of 50%, 6.5 microg/mL). At normal therapeutic serum concentration (5 microg/mL) doxycycline significantly reduced MMP-2 production from SMCs (37%; P <.05), which were stimulated with conditioned media from macrophage or lymphocyte co-culture simulating the inflammatory milieu of AAA tissue. This correlated with a decrease in MMP-2 mRNA half-life, from 49 hours to 28 hours, which suggests that doxycycline inhibits SMC MMP-2 production in part by reducing MMP-2 mRNA stability. When AAA tissue was cultured for 10 days with doxycycline at concentrations of 2.5 to 40 microg/mL, the media exhibited a concentration-dependent decrease in both active and latent forms of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Doxycycline at a concentration of 5 microg/mL reduced active and latent MMP-2 secreted from cultured AAA tissue by 50% and 30%, respectively (P <.05). These study findings demonstrate that doxycycline at standard therapeutic serum concentrations inhibits MMP-2 expression from cultured human aortic SMCs and AAA tissue explants. Inasmuch as MMP activity contributes to extracellular matrix degradation in AAAs and atherosclerotic plaque, doxycycline may have potential value in treating these diseases.",

    "abstract": "There is experimental evidence that self-expandable endoprostheses are appropriate for compensation of aortic growth. A potential future application includes their use in the treatment of aortic coarctation. Yet their behavior is poorly investigated. The present study evaluates the performance of largely oversized self-expandable endoprostheses (EPs) in the growing porcine aorta and the biologic response toward them.\nTwenty oversized EPs (Talent, TalentLoPro, Stenway, and Wallstent; nominal lumen area 314 mm(2) [diameter 20 mm]) were implanted in the descending thoracic aorta of juvenile pigs. Four nonoversized EPs (TalentLoPro; nominal lumen area 154 mm(2) [diameter 14 mm]) served as controls. Cross sections of aorta and EPs were measured by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) at implantation and 3 months follow-up. The histologic response was assessed by microscopy.\nAt implantation, the EPs were 99 +/- 41% oversized relative to the aortic area [48 +/- 22% in diameter]. At follow-up, the area of the aortic lumen increased 60 +/- 50%, P <.001 [29 +/- 23% in diameter]. The Stenway EPs demonstrated the largest prosthetic lumen with 80 +/- 10% of their nominal area (P =.001). However, the prosthetic lumen area was reduced by intimal hyperplasia in all devices. The largest perfused lumen was obtained by the TalentLoPro EPs due to their progressive expansion. Nonoversized EPs resulted in a significantly smaller perfused lumen (P =.012). The inflammatory response to polyester was moderate, whereas polyurethane evoked an extensive body-foreign reaction.\nLarge oversizing of self-expandable EPs is essential in order to maintain a large perfused lumen during aortic growth, thereby minimizing the adverse effect of intimal hyperplasia. This was best achieved by the TalentLoPro EPs.",

    "abstract": "Studies of animal and human below-knee anastomoses with Miller cuffs indicate that improved graft patency results from redistribution of intimal hyperplasia away from areas critical to flow delivery, such as the arterial toe. We hypothesize that particle hemodynamic conditions are a biophysical mechanism potentially responsible for the clinically observed shift in intimal hyperplasia localization associated with better patency of the Miller configuration.\nComputational fluid dynamics analysis of vortical flow patterns, wall shear stress fields, and potential for platelet interaction with the vascular surface was performed for realistic three-dimensional conventional and Miller cuff distal end-to-side anastomoses. Sites of significant platelet-wall interaction, including elevated near-wall particle concentrations and stasis, were identified with a validated near-wall residence time model, which includes shear stress-based factors for particle activation and surface reactivity.\nParticle hemodynamics largely coincide with the observed redistribution of intimal hyperplasia away from the critical arterial toe region. Detrimental changes in wall shear stress vector magnitude and direction are significantly reduced along the arterial suture line of the Miller cuff, largely as a result of increased anastomotic area available for flow redirection. However, because of strong particle-wall interaction, resulting high near-wall residence time contours indicate significant intimal hyperplasia along the graft-vein suture line and in the vicinity of the arterial heel.\nWhile a number of interacting mechanical, biophysical, and technical factors may be responsible for improved Miller cuff patency, our results imply that particle hemodynamics conditions engendered by Miller cuff geometry provide a mechanism that may account for redistribution of intimal hyperplasia. In particular, it appears that a focal region of significant particle-wall interaction at the arterial toe is substantially reduced with the Miller cuff configuration.",

    "abstract": "Endoscopic ligation of perforating veins is useful in treatment of perforating vein incompetence. Over the last few years the topic of interest has been the medial side of the lower leg; however, laterally located venous ulcers (10% of all) are of equal importance. Our poor results with lateral subfascial endoscopic perforating vein surgery (SEPS) procedures led us to study the anatomy of the perforating veins in the lateral leg. The presence of persistent insufficient perforating veins in our patients suggests that our procedure failed because of misinterpreted perforator anatomy.\nAnatomic dissection was performed in 16 cadavers in two stages, subcutaneously and subfascially. Perforating veins were classified relative to the short saphenous vein and intermuscular septa, with coordinates. Three hundred fifty-one perforating veins were found, for an average of 21.9 perforating veins per leg. The results showed that there is alignment of the perforating veins according to the septa between the anterior and peroneal compartment and between the peroneal compartment and the superficial dorsal compartment. Most of the perforating veins did not correlate with the short saphenous vein.\nPoor clinical results of lateral SEPS procedures might be improved after adjustment of the procedure for new anatomic information, which shows alignment of perforating veins along the intermuscular septa, obligating full septa dissection on the lateral side.",

    "abstract": "Platelet products have been proposed as adjuvant therapy for wound healing. We undertook this study to determine the healing effect of topically applied frozen autologous platelets (FAP) on chronic venous ulcers, compared with effect of placebo, and whether use of topical FAP modifies local expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), interleukin 8 (IL-8), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in wound fluid.\nThis randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was carried out in institutional practice, with ambulatory patients with proved chronic venous leg ulcers. In all patients, whole venous blood was drawn for preparation of FAP. FAP or normal saline solution was applied three times per week for up to 12 weeks, together with hydrocolloids and standardized compression bandages. Leg ulcer surface was assessed with numerical pictures. IL-8, VEGF, KGF, and TIMP-1 levels were determined (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) in wound fluid after each 4 weeks of treatment.\nFifteen patients were randomized into two groups with comparable leg ulcer characteristics. Mean percent reduction in ulcer area was 26.2% in the FAP group versus 15.2% in the placebo group (P =.94). One ulcer in each group was completely healed at study end. Levels of TIMP-1 increased significantly during FAP treatment. IL-8 concentration was significantly lower in wound fluid of healing ulcers than in the fluid of nonhealing ulcers, in both FAP and placebo groups. Growth factor levels were not modified with FAP treatment.\nTopical autologous platelets have no significant adjuvant effect on healing of chronic venous leg ulcers and increased wound fluid TIMP-1 concentration. Ulcer healing is associated with a decrease in wound fluid IL-8.",

    "abstract": "We undertook this cross-sectional study to investigate the distribution of venous reflux and effect of axial reflux in superficial and deep veins and to determine the clinical value of quantifying peak reverse flow velocity and reflux time in limbs with chronic venous disease.\nFour hundred one legs (127 with skin changes, 274 without skin changes) in 272 patients were examined with duplex ultrasound scanning, and peak reverse flow velocity and reflux time were measured. Both parameters were graded on a scale of 0 to 4. The sum of reverse flow scores was calculated from seven venous segments, three in superficial veins (great saphenous vein at saphenofemoral junction, great saphenous vein below knee, small saphenous vein) and four in deep veins (common femoral vein, femoral vein, deep femoral vein, popliteal vein). Axial reflux was defined as reflux in the great saphenous vein above and below the knee or in the femoral vein to the popliteal vein below the knee. Reflux parameters and presence or absence of axial reflux in superficial or deep veins were correlated with prevalence of skin changes or ulcer (CEAP class 4-6).\nThe most common anatomic presentation was incompetence in all three systems (superficial, deep, perforator; 46%) or in superficial or perforator veins (28%). Isolated reflux in one system only was rare (15%; superficial, 28 legs; deep, 14 legs; perforator, 18 legs). Deep venous incompetence was present in 244 legs (61%). If common femoral vein reflux was excluded, prevalence of deep venous incompetence was 52%. The cause, according to findings at duplex ultrasound scanning, was primary in 302 legs (75%) and secondary in 99 legs (25%). Presence of axial deep venous reflux increased significantly with prevalence of skin changes or ulcer (C4-C6; odds ratio [OR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56-4.67). Of 110 extremities with incompetent popliteal vein, 81 legs had even femoral vein reflux, with significantly more skin changes or ulcer, compared with 29 legs with popliteal reflux alone (P =.025). Legs with skin changes or ulcer had significantly higher total peak reverse flow velocity (P =.006), but the difference for total reflux time did not reach significance (P =.084) compared with legs without skin changes. In contrast, presence of axial reflux in superficial veins did not increase prevalence of skin changes (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.44-1.2). Incompetent perforator veins were observed as often in patients with no skin changes (C0-C3, 215 of 274, 78%) as in patients with skin changes (C4-C6, 106 of 127, 83%; P =.25).\nContinuous axial deep venous reflux is a major contributor to increased prevalence of skin changes or ulcer in patients with chronic venous disease compared with segmental deep venous reflux above or below the knee only. The total peak reverse flow velocity score is significantly higher in patients with skin changes or ulcer. It is questionable whether peak reverse flow velocity and reflux time can be used to quantify venous reflux; however, if they are used, peak reverse flow velocity seems to reflect venous malfunction more appropriately.",

Mean ABI in the worse leg showed little change over 12 years in both men and women. However, in the whole population, the ABI in the better leg showed a significant drop, 1.15 to 1.08 (P < or =.001). A total of 179 cases of intermittent claudication were identified during the 12-year follow-up. At baseline, ABI in the worse leg of the claudicants was significantly lower than in healthy subjects (.99 vs 1.08; P < or =.01).

Individuals with intermittent claudication experienced a greater decline in both legs compared with those without claudication. Deterioration occurred more rapidly in the limb with a higher ABI at baseline, which possibly indicates a systemic tendency to atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "To determine the current frequency, types of patients, indications for testing, morbidity and mortality, and management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).\nBetween December 1998 and July 2001, the charts of 102 inpatients that tested positive for heparin-associated antiplatelet antibodies (HAAb) were reviewed. There were 33,941 inpatients, 10,348 of them having received unfractionated or low molecular weight heparins. HAAb were determined by platelet aggregometry.\nThere were 58 males and 44 females with a mean age of 56 years. The majority (72%) of patients were admitted to a surgical service (23% were admitted to medicine, and 5% were admitted to obstetrics/pediatrics). Indications for testing included one or more low platelet counts (n = 51), unexplained arterial (n = 33) or venous (n = 6) thromboses, resistance to anticoagulation (n = 1), prior history of HAAb (n = 3), organ transplant (n = 17), or other indication (n = 4). The HAAb \"patterns\" were variable, with patients having antibodies only to bovine (n = 7) or porcine heparin (n = 5), bovine and porcine heparins (n = 17), enoxaparin (n = 3), fragmin (n = 7), or all 4 heparins (n = 43). The HIT-related mortality was 6.9%, and the morbidity was 30% with 19 arterial and 7 venous thromboses and 5 bleeding events. Management consisted of discontinuation of heparin in 95 patients. Twenty-five patients did not require continued anticoagulation. When needed, anticoagulation was continued with a direct thrombin inhibitor (n = 32), enoxaparin (n = 16), warfarin (n = 15), or aspirin (n = 7). Seven patients continued to receive unfractionated heparin (n = 4) or low molecular weight heparin (n = 3).\nHIT occurs in 0.99% of inpatients receiving heparin and remains an important nondiscriminatory contributor to their morbidity and mortality. Patients receiving any form of heparin who develop a decreasing platelet count, unexplained thrombosis, or resistance to heparin anticoagulation should be tested for HAAb. If HAAb are detected, patients must not receive the sensitizing heparin(s).",

We evaluated the efficacy of distal bypass grafting from the brachial artery for limb salvage in this setting.\nAll patients with end-stage renal disease with painful digital ulceration or gangrene of the hand seen from 1992 to 2002 were evaluated with clinical examination and noninvasive studies. Those with evidence of occlusive disease underwent conventional angiography. Individuals with forearm occlusive disease underwent bypass grafting, from the brachial artery to either the distal radial artery or ulnar artery at the level of the wrist or proximal hand. Follow-up was scheduled at regular intervals, and included duplex scanning. Limb salvage and bypass graft patency were determined with life table analysis.\nOver 10 years, 18 forearm bypass procedures were performed in 15 patients. The outflow artery was the radial artery in 15 procedures and the ulnar artery in 3 procedures. Bypass conduit was autogenous in all patients. No patient had a functioning arteriovenous fistula at bypass grafting; six limbs had previously occluded fistulas. Two bypass grafts (11%) occluded in the early postoperative period, with resultant progression of gangrene. In the remaining 16 grafts patency was maintained (mean follow-up, 18 months), with pain control and tissue healing.\nTreatment in patients with renal failure with upper extremity occlusive disease may be facilitated with brachiodistal bypass grafting. Pain control and reversal of progression of hand necrosis can be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic angiogenesis has great potential for the treatment of ischemic diseases. One possible route for noninvasive induction of microvessels has recently been suggested by the finding that subcontractile electrical stimulation induces increased vascularization in animals. The present study tests the ability of such stimulation to augment microvessel number in patients with peripheral vascular disease.\nOverall, 36 patients were randomly assigned to control (n = 12) and treatment (n = 24) groups. Patients in the treatment group received localized subcontractile electrical stimulation on the feet of their ischemic limbs for three 60-minute periods each day over a 6-week period. Microvessel density was determined by capillary microscopy before treatment, at 3 and 6 weeks during treatment, and 4 weeks after completion. Transcutaneous oxygen tension was also determined at this site.\nMicrovessel density determined by capillary microscopy was significantly increased (1.25-fold, P <.005) during and after treatment in patients receiving electrical stimulation. Transcutaneous oxygen tension was similarly increased in the treated patients (1.24-fold, P <.05). No changes were observed in these parameters in untreated patients examined in parallel.\nLocalized subcontractile electrical stimulation can increase microvessel density and tissue perfusion in patients with peripheral vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical closure devices for arterial hemostasis after angiography, such as the Perclose suture-mediated closure system, are designed to decrease time to ambulation and improve patient comfort. Although these devices are safe and efficacious, to date there has been little reported about use of the Perclose device in a cohort consisting exclusively of patients with lower extremity peripheral vascular disease. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of routine use of the Perclose system in patients with documented peripheral vascular disease undergoing angiography to treat chronic lower extremity ischemia.\nThe Perclose device was placed for arterial closure after femoral artery access in 500 consecutive patients with documented peripheral vascular disease (ankle-brachial index, <0.8) who underwent diagnostic angiography or percutaneous intervention because of chronic lower extremity ischemia. These 500 patients composed 91% of all patients who underwent angiography because of chronic lower extremity ischemia between January 1, 2001, and April 1, 2002. All complications associated with the Perclose device were identified and reviewed.\nOf the 500 arteries, 54% were accessed for diagnostic angiography and 46% for intervention. Perclose device placement was successful in 475 attempts (95%). Overall major complication rate was 1.4% (7 of 500 arteries). Complications included one death from retroperitoneal hemorrhage; three episodes of limb ischemia, two requiring operation and one requiring lytic therapy; two pseudoaneurysms; and one hematoma, which prolonged hospitalization. The hematoma was the only complication in the 25 patients with failed Perclose device placement. There were no infections requiring admission or operation.\nThe Perclose suture-mediated closure device is efficacious and can be used safely in selected patients with documented peripheral vascular disease. Complications associated with this device tend to be more severe than those historically reported for manual compression. Substantial experience with use of this device is required to achieve excellent results in patients with difficult anatomy.",

This prospective single center cohort study describes this less invasive endovascular technique with the ring strip cutter and its early complications. The results at midterm follow-up are presented.\nFrom April 1994 to July 2001, 49 remote-endarterectomies of the external or common iliac artery were performed in a retrograde manner from a single, groin incision in 48 patients (30 men, 31 procedures). The median age was 66 years (39 to 82 years). Indications for operation were as follows: severe claudication in 28 (57%), rest pain in 13 (27%), and gangrene in 8 (16%) procedures. Follow-up included clinical evaluation, ankle-brachial index, and duplex scanning at 6 weeks, 3 months, and yearly thereafter.\nIntraoperative technical success was achieved in 43 (88%) procedures. A retroperitoneal incision was necessary in three patients for an additional arteriotomy in the iliac artery and in three others for a bypass procedure. The mean follow-up was 20 months (2 to 77 months). Three-year cumulative primary patency rate by means of life table analysis was 60.2% +/- 12.0 (SE). During follow-up, percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty with and without stenting was performed in six and two patients, respectively, resulting in a 3-year primary-assisted patency rate of 85.7% +/- 9.56. Three-year secondary patency was 94.2% +/- 5.50.\nRemote endarterectomy in external and common iliac arterial occlusive disease is a feasible endovascular procedure with a low complication rate. The midterm primary-assisted patency rate is good.",

    "abstract": "Of 125 surgical patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) treated from 1999, 11 patients with deep shock from ruptured AAAs who underwent aortic occlusion balloon catheter (AOBC) insertion before laparotomy were studied.\nWith the patients under local anesthesia, the brachial artery was exposed and the balloon catheter was inserted into the thoracic aorta. The balloon was inflated halfway and pulled back gently to the orifice of the left subclavian artery, and was advanced with the aid of blood flow down to the abdominal aorta. After full inflation of the balloon, the catheter was pulled until the balloon was fixed at the proximal shoulder of the AAA.\nAOBC insertion was completed within 16.1 +/- 5.1 minutes. Systolic blood pressure at presentation was 84.1 +/- 31.7 mm Hg, deteriorated to 60.9 +/- 15.4 mm Hg on arrival in the operating room, and increased significantly (P <.0001) to 123.4 +/- 25.3 mm Hg after AOBC insertion. The balloon burst in three patients. Embolic complications were observed in two patients. There were three deaths, two associated with the balloon bursting. In nine patients whose shock was successfully controlled by AOBC, operative mortality was 11%.\nTransbrachial arterial insertion of an AOBC may be useful to ameliorate hemorrhagic shock in patients with ruptured AAAs.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that the intraluminal thrombus of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) affects the underlying vessel wall. Aneurysm enlargement has been associated with growth of thrombus, and rupture has been proposed to occur after bleeding into the thrombus. To examine how thrombus affects the vessel wall, we compared the morphology of aneurysm wall covered with thrombus with wall segments exposed to flowing blood. Material and methods Sixteen patients (14 men, 2 women; age range, 56-79 years) undergoing elective repair of AAA, where computed tomography scans showed thrombus and segments of the aneurysm wall exposed to flowing blood, were included in the study. Specimens from the aneurysm were taken for light and electron microscopy. Masson trichrome staining was performed for wall thickness determination and demonstration of collagen, and Weigert-van Gieson staining for elastin. The cellular composition was analyzed by immunohistochemistry with antibodies against CD3 for T cells, CD4 for T helper cells, CD8 for T cytotoxic cells, CD20 for B cells, CD68 for macrophages, and smooth muscle alpha-actin for smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Caspase-3 staining and TUNEL analysis were performed to evaluate apoptosis.\nThe aneurysm wall covered with thrombus was thinner and contained fewer elastin fibers, and the few that were found were often fragmented. This part of the wall also contained fewer SMCs and more apoptotic nuclei than the wall exposed to flowing blood. Clusters of inflammatory cells were detected in the media of the aneurysm wall and in higher numbers in the parts covered with thrombus. Electron microscopy showed that the aneurysm wall without thrombus contained a dense collagenous matrix with differentiated SMCs. In the segment covered with thrombus, SMCs were more dedifferentiated (synthetic) and apoptotic or necrotic. There were also an increased number of inflammatory cells located in close contact with SMCs in various stages of apoptosis.\nThe aneurysm wall covered with thrombus is thinner and shows more frequent signs of inflammation, apoptosis of SMCs, and degraded extracellular matrix. These findings suggest that thrombus formation and accumulation of inflammatory cells may perturb the structural integrity and stability of the vessel wall and thereby increase the risk for aneurysm rupture.",

    "abstract": "Since the introduction of endovascular repair (EVR) for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), clinical evaluation has been under way in many countries throughout the world. The main purpose of this retrospective study was to determine outcome of EVR with aortic endovascular prostheses (AEPs) and to evaluate the extent to which French practitioners have complied with regulatory and clinical guidelines for the use of these trial devices.\nThis retrospective study was conducted by the French National Health Insurance Fund for Salaried Workers. Data were compiled on EVR procedures performed at health care institutions all over mainland France between June 1999 and May 2001.\nA total of 1012 AEPs were deployed for AAA repair in France during the study period. Only 151 (14.9%) of these EVR procedures were carried out within an approved investigational setting with informed patient consent. Only 149 of the 861 patients (17.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 14.9 to 19.9%) who underwent endovascular repair in noninvestigational settings signed informed consent forms. In 452 cases (46.5%), the diameter of the AAA was 50 mm or less. Complete outcome data for the first year were available for 891 patients (88%). Complications occurred in 177 of these patients (19.9%, 95% CI, 17.3 to 22.6%). There were a total of 47 deaths (5.3%, 95% CI, 3.9 to 6.9%), including 27 during the first 30 postoperative days. Other major events during the first year after AEP implantation were ruptured AAA in 5 patients, conversion to open operation in 15, and additional endovascular treatment in 52. Data on clinical surveillance were available for 987 patients (97.5%) with a mean follow-up of 345 days. Only 294 patients (29.8%, 95% CI, 27.0 to 32.7%) underwent complete imaging within the first month after AEP implantation. A total of 184 patients (18.6%, 95% CI, 16.3 to 21.2%) received no surveillance at all.\nThis study shows the need for improvement in the clinical evaluation of new devices and medical technologies in France. Study findings also confirm the significant incidence of adverse outcomes and necessity for routine surveillance after EVR of AAA with AEP. However, risk/benefit analysis is difficult because most procedures were not carried out within a proper investigational context.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed the incidence of stent-graft migration after endovascular aneurysm repair in a prospective multicenter trial and identified factors that may predispose to such migration.\nAll patients who received treatment during the course of the multicenter AneuRx clinical trial were reviewed for evidence of stent-graft migration over 5 years, from 1996 to 2001. Post-deployment distance from the renal arteries to the proximal end of the stent graft and the proximal fixation length (length of the infrarenal neck covered by the stent graft) were determined in patients for whom pre-procedure and post-procedure computed tomography scans were measured in an independent core laboratory.\nStent-graft migration was reported in 94 of 1119 patients, with mean time after device implantation of 30 +/- 11 months. Freedom from migration was 98.6% at 1 year, 93.4% at 2 years, and 81.2% at 3 years (Kaplan-Meier method). Subset (n = 387) analysis revealed that initial device deployment was lower in 47 patients with migration, as evidenced by a greater renal artery to stent-graft distance (1.1 +/- 0.7 cm), compared with 340 patients without migration (0.8 +/- 0.6 cm; P =.006) on post-implantation computed tomography scan. Proximal fixation length was shorter in patients with migration (1.6 +/- 1.4 cm) compared with patients without migration (2.3 +/- 1.4 cm; P =.005). There was significant variation in migration rate among clinical sites (P <.001), ranging from 0% to 30% (median, 8%), with a greater than twofold difference in migration rate between the lowest quartile (6%) and the highest quartile (15%) clinical sites. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that renal artery to stent-graft distance (P =.001) and proximal fixation length (P =.005) were significant predictors of migration, and that each millimeter increase in distance below the renal arteries increased risk for subsequent migration by 5.8% and each millimeter increase in proximal fixation length decreased risk for migration by 2.5%. Pre-implantation aortic neck length, neck diameter, degree of device oversizing, correct versus incorrect oversizing, device type (stiff vs flexible), placement of proximal extender cuffs at the original procedure, and post-procedure endoleak were not significant predictors of migration. Migration was treated with placement of extender modules in 23 patients and surgical conversion in 7 patients; 64 patients (68%) with migration have required no treatment.\nStent-graft migration among patients treated in the AneuRx clinical trial appears to be largely related to low initial deployment of the device, below the renal arteries, and short proximal fixation length. Significant variation in migration rate among clinical sites highlights the importance of the technical aspects of stent-graft deployment. Advances in intraoperative imaging and deployment techniques that have been made since completion of the clinical trial facilitate precision of device placement below the renal arteries and should increase proximal fixation length. Whether this, together with increased iliac fixation length, will result in lower risk for migration remains to be determined in long-term follow-up studies.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the success of endoluminal repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is frequently based on diameter measurements and determining the presence of endoleaks. The use of three-dimensional volumetric data and observation of morphologic changes in the aneurysm and device have been proposed to be more appropriate for postdeployment surveillance. The purpose of this study was to analyze the long-term volumetric and morphologic data of 161 patients who underwent endovascular AAA exclusion and to assess the utility of volume measurements for determining successful AAA repair.\nPatients with spiral computed tomography scans obtained preoperatively, within the first postoperative month, at 6 months, and annually thereafter, were included in this analysis. Computerized interactive three-dimensional reconstruction of each AAA scan was performed. Total aneurysm sac volume was measured at each time interval (mean preoperative volume 169.0 +/- 78.5 mL), and the significance of volume changes was determined by mixed linear modeling, a form of repeated measures analysis, to account for longitudinal data clustered at the individual level. Sixty-two patients (38%) developed endoleaks at some time during follow-up-15 type I leaks, 45 type II leaks, and 2 type III leaks. The patients with type I and type III leaks were treated with cuffs, and the type II leaks were treated either with observation, side-branch embolization, or required open conversion.\nAneurysm sac volume increased slightly at 1-month follow-up (+3.3%), and then decreased steadily to -12.9% at 5 years (P <.0001). This effect remained unchanged after controlling for the three device types used in our study population. Patients who did not exhibit an endoleak (n = 99) showed a significant decrease in aneurysm volume across the entire follow-up duration when compared with those who did exhibit an endoleak (n = 62) (P <.0001). The presence of a 10% or greater decrease in volume at 6 months demonstrated a sensitivity of 64%, a specificity of 95%, a positive predictive value of 95%, a negative predictive value of 62%, and an accuracy of 75% for predicting primary clinical success defined by successful deployment of the device; freedom from aneurysm- or procedure-related death; freedom from endoleak, rupture, migration, or device malfunction; or conversion to open repair.\nVolumetric analysis may be used to predict successful endoluminal exclusion of AAAs. Volume regression appears to be device-independent and should be expected in most clinically successful cases. The presence of volume increases in the first 6 months is suspicious for an endoleak that is pressurizing the aneurysm sac and heralds the need for closer evaluation and possible intervention. A volume decrease of 10% or greater at 6 months and continuing regression over time is associated with successful endovascular repair.",

    "abstract": "Research investigating the benefits of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on cognitive functioning remains inconclusive. This study sought to determine what patient characteristics affect cognitive functioning and whether changes in cognitive functioning occur following surgery after controlling for these characteristics.\nIn a prospective longitudinal study, 39 patients scheduled for CEA surgery underwent neuropsychological testing in the week prior to their surgery. Two patients had a stroke following surgery, leaving 37 patients who were tested again at 7 days and 3 months following surgery. The surgery was performed under a locoregional anesthetic.\nPatient characteristics associated with cognitive functioning were age, education, and IQ. In addition, differences in cognitive performance on a number of tests were related to presenting symptoms. Stroke patients (n = 6) differed significantly from symptom-free patients (n = 18) and patients with symptoms (n = 13) on measures of verbal fluency, visual search and mental flexibility, and verbal learning. When differences in patient characteristics were controlled for, no significant changes in cognitive functioning were found that could be attributed to the effects of surgery.\nNo changes in cognitive functioning were associated with CEA. Differences in cognitive functioning, however, were associated with patient characteristics, including differences in presenting symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Previously we failed to demonstrate a correlation between plaque type and symptoms in 165 carotid endarterectomy specimens. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relation between the anatomy of the carotid plaques and the presence of symptoms in 281 carotid endarterectomy specimens.\nThe patients were 213 men (mean age, 68 years) and 68 women (mean age, 68.7 years), with symptomatic disease (n = 133) or asymptomatic disease (n = 148). Specimens were processed for histologic analysis and immunohistochemistry.\nPlaques were categorized as complicated or noncomplicated, and ruptured or nonruptured. Risk factors could not be correlated with any pathologic or immunohistochemical findings or between plaque type and clinical symptoms.\nAlmost 70% of plaque specimens demonstrated thrombus, intraplaque hemorrhage, or both. Thrombosis was observed in one fourth of specimens, and intraplaque hemorrhage in almost two thirds of specimens. Sixty four percent of plaques demonstrated neovascularization. It was not possible to demonstrate that complicated plaques (plaque rupture, thrombosis, intraplaque hemorrhage) are associated with symptoms, and it appears that such plaques may occur at any time, irrespective of symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative risks and advantages of using external jugular vein (EJV) patch, compared with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patch, during carotid endarterectomy. The primary end point was the relevant neurologic complication rate (RNCR; fatal or disabling stroke) at any time during follow-up. Secondary end points included stroke-free survival, 30-day and long-term mortality, recurrent stenosis rate (> or =50%), occlusion, patch infection, aneurysm formation, and other local complications.\nThe study, a prospective randomized clinical trial carried out at a single center, was divided into two 3-year phases: December 1996 to March 1999, when patients were enrolled, and March 1999 to March 2002, which was the follow-up period. Inclusion criteria included an external jugular vein suitable for patching, defined as vein diameter 3 mm or larger and absence of collateral vessels noted on preoperative color duplex ultrasound scans. Patients were prospectively randomized 1:1 to receive either the EJV (n = 80; group A) or synthetic (n = 80; group B) patch.\nCarotid endarterectomy and patching was performed by one surgeon. At 30 months the RNCR-free rate, analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method, was 98.7% for group A (1 ipsilateral lethal stroke) and 94.6% for group B (4 ipsilateral disabling strokes), and remained stable to 60 months. No statistical difference was observed with the log-rank test. Stroke-free survival rate was 100% for group A and 98.7% for group B at 1 year, 98.7% for group A and 93.6% for group B (1 ipsilateral minor stroke) at 30 months, and was unchanged at 60 months. Life table analysis demonstrated freedom from significant recurrent stenosis (> or =50%) of 97.5% for both groups at 6 months, 93.6% for group A and 92.2% for group B at 30 months, and 90.2% for group A and 86.7% for group B at 60 months. No statistical difference was observed with the log-rank test. In no patients was recurrent stenosis greater than 70%. No aneurysm formation was noted during follow-up.\nWe can conclude, with the power limitation of the study, that carotid endarterectomy can be safely performed with either the EJV or PTFE patch. Advantages of the EJV for carotid angioplasty include no cost for material, low risk for graft infection, and preservation of the saphenous vein.",

    "abstract": "Background and purpose Postoperative microemboli in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy are a significant risk factor for stroke. These emboli can be detected by intraoperative transcranial Doppler monitoring. They are not linked to technical error and are variable between patients. As it is known that platelets play a key role in arterial thrombosis, it was hypothesized that a patient's risk of postoperative carotid thrombosis was linked to the individual's platelet response to physiologic agonists.\nBlood samples from 120 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were analyzed before surgery. Platelet aggregation was measured in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (0.5 to 4 micromol/L), collagen (10 to 50 mg/mL), and arachidonic acid (3 or 6 micromol/L), and fibrinogen binding to GPIIb-IIIa was measured by whole blood flow cytometry in response to ADP (0.1 to 10 micromol/L) and thrombin (0.02 to 0.16 micro/mL). Patients underwent intraoperative transcranial Doppler monitoring for 3 hours after surgery, and platelet functional data of those who had >25 emboli in this period (n = 22) were compared with the data of those with <25 emboli (n = 88).\nThe platelet response to ADP was significantly higher in the patients with >25 emboli, as measured both by aggregometry (P =.0012) and by flow cytometry (P <.0001). Platelet aggregation with collagen was also significantly higher in this group (P =.0018), but the response to thrombin was not statistically different in the two groups. In addition, there was no difference in the response to arachidonic acid between the groups.\nThe platelet response to ADP may be linked to clinical outcome, and thus, specific ADP receptor inhibitors may be appropriate for this group of patients.",

We performed an open prospective study to evaluate the prognostic significance of carotid stenosis on long-term survival of patients who had undergone elective operative repair of AAA.\nTwo hundred eight patients who underwent elective open AAA repair in our department between March 1987 and December 2001 were included in the study. All patients were evaluated preoperatively with color duplex ultrasound (US) scanning of the carotid arteries, and were followed up with clinical examination and carotid duplex US scanning 1 month after the operation and every 6 months thereafter. Median duration of follow-up was 50 months (range, 5-181 months). Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as all causes of mortality, were recorded and analyzed with regard to traditional risk factors and carotid US findings.\nTwenty-seven fatal and 46 nonfatal cardiovascular events were recorded. Both univariate and multivariate analysis showed that carotid stenosis 50% or greater and echolucent plaque were significantly associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Carotid stenosis was a stronger predictor of cardiovascular death than was ankle/brachial index. Age, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus were also associated with higher mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular causes.\nPatients electively operated on for AAA repair and with stenosis 50% or greater and echolucent plaque at duplex US scanning are at significantly increased risk for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Carotid US can therefore be used to select a subgroup of patients with AAA who might benefit from medical intervention, including antiplatelet and lipid-lowering agents.",

    "abstract": "We examined economic and practice trends after 5 years of a merger between vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists.\nIn 1998 a merger between the Division of Vascular Surgery and the Section of Interventional Radiology at the University of Rochester established the Center for Vascular Disease (CVD). Business activity was administered from the offices of the vascular surgeons.\nIn 1998 the CVD included five vascular surgeons and three interventional radiologists, who generated a total income of $5,789,311 US dollars (34% from vascular surgeons, 24% from interventional radiologists, 42% from vascular laboratories). Vascular surgeon participation in endoluminal therapy was limited to repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Income was derived from 1011 major vascular procedures, 10,510 catheter-based procedures in 3286 patients, and 1 inpatient and 3 outpatient vascular laboratory tests.

    "abstract": "Preoperative duplex scanning of arm and forearm veins has increased the creation of autogenous arteriovenous (AV) fistulas. However, the cumulative functional patency and durability of transposed AV fistulas (TAVF) compared with nontransposed AV fistulas (AVF) and prosthetic bridging grafts (AVG) remains ill-defined.\nFrom January 1998 to December 2002, 245 dialysis access procedures were performed at University Hospital and the Veteran Affairs Medical Center in New Jersey. Follow-up data were available for 125 procedures (TAVF, n = 42; AVF, n = 30; AVG, n = 53) performed in 97 patients. All access procedures were planned on the basis of preoperative duplex scans of arm and forearm veins. Functional patency was defined as ability to cannulate and hemodialyze patients successfully. Primary and secondary cumulative functional patency of TAVFs, AVFs, and AVGs was determined with life table analysis, and differences were analyzed with the log-rank test. Differences in revision rates, including thrombolysis, thrombectomies, and operative revisions, were determined with the Fisher exact t test.\nMean follow-up was 18 months (range, 4-24 months). For TAVFs, AVFs, and AVGs, primary functional patency rate at 1 year was 76.2%, 53.3%, and 47.2%, respectively, and at 2 years was 67.7%, 34.4%, and 25.5%, respectively. Similarly, secondary functional patency rate at 1 year was 83.2%, 66.7%, and 58.5%, respectively, and at 2 years was 74.6%, 56.2%, and 40.2%, respectively. Primary and secondary functional patency rates for TAVFs were superior to those for AVGs at 1 and 2 years (P <.001). AVFs had superior secondary functional patency rate at 2 years, compared with AVGs (P <.05), and TAVFs had superior primary and secondary patency rates at 2 years, compared with AVFs (P <.05). AVGs required significantly more revisions than did TAVFs (28.5% vs 54.7%; P <.001) or AVFs (36.7% vs 54.7%; P <.05).\nPreoperative duplex scanning of upper arm and forearm veins facilitated successful creation of all types of autogenous fistulas at our institution. TAVF cumulative functional patency rates were superior compared with AVGs and AVFs. Furthermore, TAVFs and AVFs were more durable and required fewer revisions than did AVGs. When preoperative duplex criteria indicate that TAVFs can be performed, they should be the initial access of choice, because of their superior long-term patency and durability.",

    "abstract": "Total graft excision with in situ or extra-anatomic revascularization is considered mandatory to treat infection involving the body of aortic grafts. We present a series of nine patients with this complication and such severe comorbid medical illnesses or markedly hostile abdomens that traditional treatments were precluded. In these patients selective complete or partial graft preservation was used.\nOver the past 20 years we have treated nine infected infrarenal aortic prosthetic grafts with complete or partial graft preservation, because excision of the graft body was not feasible. In all nine patients infection of the main body of the aortic graft was documented at computed tomography or surgery. Essential adjuncts included percutaneous or operative drain placement into retroperitoneal abscess cavities and along the graft, with instillation of antibiotics three times daily, repeated debridement of infected groin wounds, and intravenous antibiotic therapy for at least 6 weeks.\nOne patient with purulent groin drainage treated with complete graft preservation died of sepsis. One patient with groin infection treated with complete graft preservation initially did well, but ultimately required total graft excision 5 months later, after clinical improvement. In four patients complete graft preservation was successful; two patients required excision of an occluded infected limb of the graft; and one patient underwent subtotal graft excision, leaving a graft remnant on the aorta, and axillopopliteal bypass. In summary, seven of nine patients survived hospitalization after complete or partial graft preservation; amputation was avoided in all but one patient; and no recurrent infection developed over mean follow-up of 7.6 years (range, 2-15 years).\nAlthough contrary to conventional concepts, partial or complete graft preservation combined with aggressive drainage and groin wound debridement is an acceptable option for treatment of infection involving an entire aortic graft in selected patients with prohibitive risks for total graft excision. This treatment may be compatible with long-term survival and protracted absence of signs or symptoms of infection.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to review our experience with delayed open conversion (>30 days) following endovascular aortoiliac aneurysm repair (EVAR) and to introduce the concept and advantages of endograft retention in this setting.\nFrom January 1992 to January 2003, a total of 386 EVARs using a variety of endografts were successfully deployed. Eleven (2.8%) patients required delayed conversion to open repair at an average of 30 months (range, 10-64). Data from all patients undergoing both EVAR and open conversion were prospectively collected.\nEVARs were performed using grafts made by Talent (4), Vanguard (2,) AneuRx (1), and Surgeon (4). Conversion to open repair (9 transabdominal, 1 retroperitoneal, 1 transabdominal plus thoracotomy) was performed for aneurysm rupture in 7 patients (4 type 1 endoleak, 2 type 2 endoleak, 1 aortoenteric fistula) and aneurysm enlargement in 4 patients (1 type 1 endoleak, 1 type 2 endoleak, 1 type 3 endoleak, 1 endotension). Patients with aneurysm rupture were treated on an emergent basis. Complete removal of the endograft with supraceliac cross-clamping was performed in two cases. One patient (rupture) did not survive the operation, and one patient (aortoenteric fistula) died 2 weeks postoperatively. In the remaining nine cases, the endograft was either completely (1) or partially (6) removed, or left in situ (2). Supraceliac balloon control (2), supraceliac clamping (1), suprarenal clamping (1), or infrarenal clamping (5) was used in these cases. All nine of these patients survived the operation. In one procedure in which the endograft was left intact (endotension), repair was accomplished by exposing the endograft and by placing a standard tube graft over it as a sleeve. In the second procedure in which the graft was left in situ (rupture), the graft was well incorporated, and bleeding lumbar arteries were oversewn and the sac was closed tightly over the endograft. In the remaining 7 cases, the endograft was transected and the proximal portion only (6) or the proximal and distal portions (1) were excised. All surviving patients continue to do well and remain without complications associated with the endograft remnant at a mean follow-up of 22 months (range, 3-56) from the time of open conversion and 46 months (range, 10-73) from the time of original EVAR.\nOpen repair in the setting of a long-standing endograft offers several unique technical challenges but can be successfully accomplished in most patients. Preservation of all or part of the endograft is possible in many patients. This technique simplifies the operative approach and is preferred over complete endograft removal if possible.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the morbidity and mortality of surgery for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) in patients with prior aortic surgery are increased.\nThe results for all patients undergoing operation for TAAA at a single institution were reviewed.\nOver a 10-year interval, 279 patients (136 women and 143 men) underwent aortic replacement for TAAA. The mean patient age was 68 years (range, 34-90). The extent of aortic replacement was relatively evenly distributed: type I (91), type II (54), type III (78), or type IV (56). Of these 279 patients, 76 (27%) had undergone prior aortic surgery. Prior infrarenal AAA was the most common prior procedure (56, 20%). Reoperation for prior failed TAAA repair was performed in 20 (7%) patients. A history of Marfan syndrome was highly associated with the need for remedial TAAA procedures (P <.0001). Overall 30-day mortality was 11.4% (32). Mortality was independent of prior aortic surgery (P =.98), prior AAA (P =.84), prior TAAA (P =.61), and gender (P =.18). Postoperative complications were seen in 67 (24%) patients and were more likely in patients who had undergone prior AAA surgery (P =.008). TAAA repair in patients with recurrent TAAA was not associated with higher morbidity (P =.33). Paraplegia (10) occurred in type I (3), type II (2), and type III (5) aneurysms but not in type IV (0), and its development was associated with higher mortality (P =.01). Prior aortic surgery was not found to be predictive of paraplegia (P =.90), although 30% of patients who developed paraplegia had a history of prior AAA repair.\nAortic reoperation for TAAA is required in a significant number of patients, particularly those with Marfan syndrome. Therefore, ongoing surveillance of the residual aorta is mandatory. Postoperative complications are more likely to occur in patients after prior infrarenal aortic replacement, but mortality is not significantly increased. Special technical considerations exist for remedial procedures after failed TAAA repair to provide protection for the spinal cord, kidneys, and viscera. Patients with failed TAAA procedures or progression of aneurysmal extent should be offered reoperation when indicated.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the performance and identify predictors of outcome after the use of self-expanding nitinol stents in the treatment of femoropopliteal arterial occlusive disease.\nA retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database was performed. Outcomes of patients who underwent placement of a nitinol stent in the femoral or above-knee popliteal arteries between 1999 and 2002 were studied. Patency, limb salvage, and patient survival were determined by Kaplan-Meier estimation and intergroup comparisons by log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model. To define individual factors associated with clinical outcomes, stepwise regression analysis was performed.\nA total of 41 patients (mean age, 70 +/- 10 years; gender, 26 men and 15 women) underwent percutaneous placement of nitinol stents. Limb salvage was the indication for intervention in 68% of patients. Diabetes was present in 54%, and 36% had end-stage renal disease. Nitinol stents were placed in the superficial femoral (35 patients) or the above-knee popliteal (6 patients) arteries. The mean postprocedural increase in ankle-brachial index was 0.32 +/- 0.19. The 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year primary patency and limb-salvage rates were 95%, 84%, and 84%, and 92%, 89%, and 89%, respectively. Major amputations occurred only in patients undergoing limb-salvage procedures presenting with major tissue loss. No statistically significant differences in patency were seen with regard to diabetes, end-stage renal disease, runoff score, length of vessel stented (median, 80 mm), hypertension, or smoking.\nOur initial experience with self-expanding nitinol stents for femoropopliteal occlusive disease appears to demonstrate acceptable patency and limb-salvage rates at these early time points. Further evaluation of clinical outcome with these devices in this and larger groups of patients is warranted.",

    "abstract": "To our knowledge, ours is the largest single-center experience with diagnosis and management of acute arterial hemorrhagic and limb-threatening ischemic complications associated with total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\nBetween 1989 and 2002, 23,199 TKA procedures (13,618 total, 11,953 primary, 1665 revision) and THR procedures (9581 total, 7812 primary, 1769 revision) were performed at the orthopedic service of Pennsylvania Hospital, Philadelphia. Arterial injuries were grouped according to type (ischemia, bleeding, pseudoaneurysm, ischemia plus bleeding) and time of recognition of injury (0-5 days after orthoplasty).\nAcute arterial complications developed in 32 patients (0.13%), associated with 24 TKA procedures (0.17%) and 8 THA procedures (0.08%; P =.0609). There were no deaths, and limb salvage was achieved in all patients. Arterial injury was detected by the orthopedic service on the same day (SD group) as performance of joint replacement in 18 patients (56%), but was not recognized until the first to fifth postoperative day (PO group) in 14 patients (44%). Arterial complications included acute lower-limb ischemia only in 18 patients SD group, 9; PO group, 9), bleeding only in 4 patients (SD group), arterial transection resulting in both ischemia and bleeding in 5 patients (SD group), and arterial pseudoaneurysm in 5 patients (PO group). Of the 18 patients with acute ischemia only, preoperative arteriography was performed in 12 patients (67%), and 6 patients (33%) were brought directly to the operating room because of advanced ischemia. Revascularization procedures in these 18 patients included bypass to the infrapopliteal artery (n = 7), popliteal artery (n = 5), or common femoral artery (n = 1); in only 5 patients (28%) was thrombectomy alone successful. These 18 patients tended to require fasciotomy (4 of 9 vs 2 of 9; P =.6199) and have foot drop (3 of 9 vs 1 of 9; P =.5765) more frequently when ischemia was recognized after the day of surgery. Bleeding was managed with arteriorrhaphy. Arterial transection was treated with end-to-end anastomosis (n = 3), interposition grafting (n = 1), and below-knee popliteal bypass (n = 1). Popliteal artery pseudoaneurysm was treated with percutaneous methods (n = 3) or surgery (n = 2).\nIn this series, risk for arterial injury associated with THA and TKA was remarkably low. Nonetheless, even at a high-volume orthopedic hospital, acute arterial injury was not recognized on the day of surgery in about half of patients. Judicious use of preoperative arteriography and aggressive revascularization are critical to achieving limb salvage. Simple arterial thrombectomy to treat ischemic complications of THA and TKA is rarely sufficient.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting has been proposed as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy in cerebral revascularization. Although early results from several centers have been encouraging, concerns remain regarding long-term durability of carotid artery stenting. We report the incidence, characteristics, and management of in-stent recurrent stenosis after long-term follow-up of carotid artery stenting.\nCarotid artery stenting (n = 122) was performed in 118 patients between September 1996 and March 2003. Indications included recurrent stenosis after previous carotid endarterectomy (66%), primary lesions in patients at high-risk (29%), and previous ipsilateral cervical radiation therapy (5%). Fifty-five percent of patients had asymptomatic stenosis; 45% had symptomatic lesions. Each patient was followed up with serial duplex ultrasound scanning. Selective angiography and repeat intervention were performed when duplex ultrasound scans demonstrated 80% or greater in-stent recurrent stenosis. Data were prospectively recorded, and were statistically analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.\nCarotid artery stenting was performed successfully in all cases, with the WallStent or Acculink carotid stent. Thirty-day stroke and death rate was 3.3%, attributable to retinal infarction (n = 1), hemispheric stroke (n = 1), and death (n = 2). Over follow-up of 1 to 74 months (mean, 18.8 months), 22 patients had in-stent recurrent stenosis (40%-59%, n = 11; 60%-79%, n = 6; > or =80%, n = 5), which occurred within 18 months of carotid artery stenting in 13 patients (60%). None of the patients with in-stent recurrent stenosis exhibited neurologic symptoms. Life table analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves predicted cumulative in-stent recurrent stenosis 80% or greater in 6.4% of patients at 60 months. Three of five in-stent recurrent stenoses occurred within 15 months of carotid artery stenting, and one each occurred at 20 and 47 months, respectively. Repeat angioplasty was performed once in 3 patients and three times in 1 patient, and repeat stenting in 1 patient, without complications. One of these patients demonstrated asymptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion 1 year after repeat intervention.\nCarotid artery stenting can be performed with a low incidence of periprocedural complications. The cumulative incidence of clinically significant in-stent recurrent stenosis (> or =80%) over 5 years is low (6.4%). In-stent restenosis was not associated with neurologic symptoms in the 5 patients noted in this cohort. Most instances of in-stent recurrent stenosis occur early after carotid artery stenting, and can be managed successfully with endovascular techniques.",

    "abstract": "A few nonrandomized studies have reported the natural history of carotid artery stenosis (CAS) contralateral to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). This study analyzed this condition with data from two randomized prospective trials.\nThe contralateral carotid arteries in 534 patients from two randomized trials that compared CEA with primary closure versus patching were followed up clinically and with duplex ultrasound scanning at 1 month and then every 6 months. CAS was classified as less than 50%, 50% to 79%, 80% to 99%, and occlusion. Late contralateral CEA was performed to treat significant CAS. Progression was defined as progress to a higher category of stenosis. Kaplan-Meier life table analysis was used to estimate freedom from progression of CAS. The correlation of risk factors and CAS progression was also analyzed.\nOf 534 patients, 61 had initial contralateral CEA and 53 had contralateral occlusion. Overall, CAS progressed in 109 of 420 patients (26%) at mean follow-up of 41 months. Progression of CAS was noted in 5 of 162 patients (3%) with baseline normal carotid arteries. CAS progressed in 56 of 157 patients (36%) with less than 50% stenosis versus 45 of 95 patients (47%) with 50% to 79% stenosis (P =.003). Median time to progression was 24 months for less than 50% CAS, and 12 months for 50% to 79% CAS (P =.035). At 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, freedom from disease progression in patients with baseline CAS <50% was 95%, 78%, 69%, 61%, 48%, respectively, and in patients with 50% to 79% CAS was 75%, 61%, 51%, 43%, and 33%, respectively (P =.003). Freedom from progression in patients with baseline normal carotid arteries at 1 through 5 years was 99%, 98%, 96%, 96%, and 94%, respectively. Late neurologic events referable to the CCA were infrequent (28 of 420 [6.7%] in the entire series; 28 of 258 [10.9%] patients with contralateral CAS), and included 10 strokes (2.4%) and 18 transient ischemic attacks (4.3%). However, late contralateral CEA was performed in 62 patients (62 of 420 [15%] in the entire series; 62 of 258 [24%] patients with contralateral CAS). Survival rates were 96%, 92%, 90%, 87%, and 82%, respectively, at 1 through 5 years.\nProgression of CCA stenosis was noted in a significant number of patients with baseline contralateral CAS. Serial clinical studies and duplex ultrasound scanning every 6 to 12 months in patients with 50% to 79% CAS, and every 12 to 24 months in patients with 50% or less CAS is adequate.",
