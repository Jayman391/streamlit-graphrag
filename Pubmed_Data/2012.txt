    "abstract": "The PETTICOAT (Provisional ExTension to Induce COmplete ATtachment) technique may be employed during endovascular treatment of type B aortic dissection (TBD) using self-expandable bare stents distal to the covered stent graft placed over the proximal entry tear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the volume changes of the true (TL) and false lumen (FL) on computed tomography (CT) scans.\nSince 2005, 25 selected patients received endovascular treatment for complicated TBD with the PETTICOAT technique employing the Zenith Dissection Endovascular System (William Cook Europe, Bjaerverskov, Denmark). Indications to the use of the PETTICOAT technique were the evidence of clinical manifest dynamic malperfusion in five cases (20%) and/or radiologic evidence of TL collapse in 20 cases (80%). Five patients were treated within 2 weeks from onset, 13 patients between 2 weeks and 3 months, and seven patients over 3 months after the initial acute event. The volumetric analysis of the changes of TL and FL obtained from CT scan performed before endovascular treatment of TBD, postoperatively and yearly thereafter were analyzed using the OsiriX software v 3.9 (Pixmeo sarl, Bernex, Switzerland).\nInitial clinical (30 days) and midterm clinical success was observed in 21 cases (84%) and in 23 cases (92%), respectively. The volumes of the aortic TL and FL were evaluated at 30 days and midterm follow-up (mean, 38 \u00b1 17 months). The following TL volumes were recorded: baseline 84 \u00b1 29 cm(3), postoperative 167 \u00b1 31 cm(3) (+98%), 1 year 193 \u00b1 46 cm(3) (+131%), and 2 years 216 \u00b1 54 cm(3) (+140%). The following FL volumes were recorded: baseline 332 \u00b1 86 cm(3), postoperative 286 \u00b1 85 cm(3) (-14%), 1 year 233 \u00b1 81 cm(3) (-30%), and 2 years 248 \u00b1 112 cm(3) (-32%). Progressive remodeling of the TL was recorded over time in both thoracic and abdominal segments with shrinkage of the FL mainly in the thoracic segment.\nThese data provide insight into potential therapeutic benefit of the PETTICOAT technique. A significant immediate increase in TL could be achieved with resolution of all cases of dynamic malperfusion and TL collapse. A different behavior of volumes in the thoracic and abdominal segments was observed.",

    "abstract": "To determine if there are any differences in outcomes between infrarenal fixation (IF) and suprarenal fixation (SF) endograft systems for the endovascular treatment (endovascular aneurysm repair [EVAR]) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) with short, straight proximal aortic necks (<1.5 cm).\nA retrospective review of 1379 EVAR procedures was performed between the years of 2002 and 2009 at a single institution. The charts and radiographic images of all patients were reviewed. Patients who underwent EVAR with AAA morphology with short proximal necks were stratified into two groups: IF, Gore Excluder (W. L. Gore, Flagstaff, Ariz) group and SF, Cook Zenith (Cook, Bloomington, Ind) group. The primary end point for the study was the presence of proximal type 1 endoleaks. Secondary end points were graft migration at 1- and 2-year follow-up and aneurysm sac regression. The groups' demographics and comorbidities were also compared.\nA total of 1379 EVARS were performed during the study period and 84 were identified as having a short proximal aortic neck. Sixty patients were in the IF group and 24 in the SF group. The average follow-up period was 18.6 months (IF) and 18.5 months (SF). There was no difference in the average proximal neck length (1.19 cm IF vs 1.14 cm SF; P = not significant [NS]) or the preoperative AAA size (5.8 cm IF vs 5.9 cm SF; P = NS). There were no significant differences in age (76.6 years IF vs 74.8 years SF; P = .32), gender (IF 66.7% vs SF 21.88% men; P = .053), or length of stay (2.2 days IF vs 1.9 days SF; P = .39). The comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, and warfarin use) were also similar. There were five type 1a endoleaks in group IF and one in group SF (P = .44) identified at the 1-month follow-up; however, only one patient in the IF group underwent intervention for enlargement of the AAA sac. At 1 year, there was persistence of one type 1a endoleak in both groups, but these were deemed dead-end leaks as they did not fill the sac nor lead to aneurysm growth. There were no migrations (>0.5 cm) noted in either group. Sac regression was observed at an average rate of 0.24 cm/year in the IF group and 0.26 cm/year in the SF group (P = NS). There were no aneurysm ruptures during the study period.\nThere are no significant differences in endograft migration or in the incidence of early and late type 1a endoleaks between endografts that use IF (Gore Excluder) and SF (Cook Zenith) fixation for patients with short aortic necks undergoing EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Venous hypoxia has been postulated to contribute to varicose vein (VV) formation. Direct measurements of vein wall oxygen tension have previously demonstrated that the average minimum oxygen tensions were significantly lower in VVs compared with non-varicose veins (NVVs). Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are nuclear transcriptional factors that regulate the expression of several genes of oxygen homeostasis. This study aimed to investigate if hypoxia was associated with VVs by assessing the expression of HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, HIF target genes, and upstream HIF regulatory enzymes in VVs and NVVs, and their regulation by hypoxia.\nVVs and NVVs were surgically retrieved and immediately snap-frozen or used for organ culture preparation. The relative expression of HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, HIF target genes, and HIF regulatory enzymes in VVs and NVVs was analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and Western blot. VV and NVV organ ex vivo cultures were exposed to 16 hours of normoxia, hypoxia (oxygen tension 1%), or the hypoxia mimetic dimethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG) 1 mM in normoxia. The vein organ cultures were then analyzed for HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, and their target gene expression with Q-PCR and Western blot.\nHIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 mRNA were significantly upregulated in VVs compared with NVVs (89.8 \u00b1 18.6 vs 10.4 \u00b1 7.2 and 384.9 \u00b1 209.4 vs 8.1 \u00b1 4.2, respectively). HIF target gene mRNA expression was also significantly elevated in VVs compared with NVVs, namely glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1; 8.7 \u00b1 2.1 vs 1.0 \u00b1 0.3), carbonic anhydrase-9 (CA9; 8.5 \u00b1 2.1 vs 2.8 \u00b1 1.2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 7.5 \u00b1 2.1 vs 0.9 \u00b1 0.2), and BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP-3; 4.5 \u00b1 0.7 vs 1.4 \u00b1 0.3). The upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, and HIF target genes in VVs was also reflected at protein level. Of the HIF regulatory enzymes, the expression of prolyl-hydroxylase domain (PHD)-2 and PHD-3 was found to be elevated in VVs compared with NVVs. Exposure of VV and NVV organ cultures to hypoxia or DMOG was associated with increases in HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 protein and HIF target gene expression compared with normoxia only.\nThe study concluded, we believe for the first time, an increased activation of the HIF pathway, with upregulation of the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 transcription factors, and HIF target genes, in VVs compared with NVVs. Exposure of VVs and NVVs to hypoxic conditions was associated with increased expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 protein and HIF target genes. The data suggest that the HIF pathway may be associated with several pathophysiologic changes in the VV wall, and that hypoxia may be a feature contributing to VV pathogenesis.",

Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), with or without the addition of mechanical techniques, is increasingly recommended for patients with iliofemoral DVT, although its effect on postthrombotic syndrome is not established. This study examined the correlation of residual thrombus with postthrombotic syndrome after catheter-based attempts at thrombus removal in patients with iliofemoral DVT.\nSeventy-one consecutive patients with iliofemoral DVT were treated with CDT. Pretreatment and posttreatment phlebograms were evaluated for quantity of residual thrombus by physicians blinded to clinical patient outcomes. Postthrombotic syndrome was assessed using CEAP and Villalta scores by examiners blinded to phlebographic results. Patients were grouped by the amount of residual thrombus in treated vein segments (group 1, \u226450%; group 2, >50%). Clinical score and postthrombotic outcomes were plotted vs residual thrombus.\nSixty-three of 71 patients completed CEAP and Villalta analyses. Groups 1 and 2 had median CEAP scores of 1 and 4 (P = .025) and mean Villalta scores of 2.21 and 7.13, respectively (P = .011). There was a direct and significant correlation of clinical class of CEAP with residual thrombus (R(2) = .74; P = .004) and a direct linear correlation of Villalta score with residual thrombus (R(2) = .61; P = .0014).\nIn patients with iliofemoral DVT treated with catheter-based techniques of thrombus removal, postthrombotic morbidity is related to residual thrombus. When thrombus clearance was complete, the postthrombotic syndrome was avoided. Residual thrombus is associated with an increasing risk of postthrombotic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The resuscitation of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAAs) has not been well studied, and the potential benefit of autotransfusion (AT) is unknown. The increased use of fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) has been associated with decreased mortality rates in trauma patients and may also improve RAAA survival. We explored the influence of intraoperative AT and FFP resuscitation on mortality rates in massively transfused RAAA patients.\nA single-center review of RAAA patient records from April 1989 to October 2009 was undertaken. Clinical data and outcomes were studied. Operative and anesthesia records were queried for intraoperative transfusion totals. Massive transfusion was defined as \u226510 units of red blood cells (RBCs) inclusive of AT units.\nWe identified 151 RAAA patients, of which 89 (60%) received a massive transfusion and comprised the study population. These 89 patients had an in-hospital mortality rate of 44%. Univariate predictors of mortality included increased age, preoperative hypotension, operative blood loss, and crystalloid, RBCs, and FFP volume. AT was used in 85 patients, with an increased ratio of AT:RBC units associated with survival. Mortality was 34% with AT:packed RBCs (PRBC) \u22651 (high AT) and 55% with AT:PRBC of <1 (low AT; P = .04). On multivariate analysis, age > 74 years (P = .03), lowest preoperative systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mm Hg (P = .06), blood loss >6 liters (P = .06), and low AT (P = .02) independently predicted mortality.

AT:PRBC ratios were stable over time (range, 1.4-1.2; P = .18).\nGreater use of AT but not of FFP was associated with survival in massively transfused RAAA patients. No mortality benefit was seen with increased FFP, but few patients had high FFP transfusion ratios. Further study to identify RAAA patients at risk for massive transfusion should be undertaken and a potentially greater role for AT in RAAA resuscitation investigated.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of endovascular surgery has increased the vascular surgeon's exposure to radiation, raising concern for female vascular trainees and staff of childbearing years. We developed surveys for female trainees, established vascular surgeons, and program directors in vascular surgery to determine current practices with respect to pregnancy and radiation exposure guidelines.\nTwo surveys were conducted to evaluate radiation exposure during pregnancy. A survey of the members of the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery was conducted in an attempt to gather information about existing program and institutional radiation policies and assess the need for standard guidelines. A second survey was given to women in vascular surgery in an effort to obtain opinions among concerned groups regarding establishment of a policy from women who were exposed to radiation during and after completion of vascular training.\nFifty-three of 181 female vascular surgeons (29% response rate) responded to the survey, with the majority (53% [28/53]) pregnant during training or practice. Though 68% of trainees and 82% of faculty performed endovascular procedures during pregnancy, only 42% of trainees and 50% of faculty wore a fetal badge. One trainee (3.7%) had complications during pregnancy that necessitated cessation of fluoroscopic procedures or limiting call. There were four practicing surgeons who had complications during their pregnancy. Of these, one was hospitalized with fetal decelerations secondary to excessive on-call obligations with double leading and heavy endovascular call coverage. The majority of women (>60%) felt supported by the program and that they were treated fairly. Over 90% of female trainees and faculty felt that establishment of guidelines for radiation safety for all vascular surgeons would be beneficial. Many (77%) felt that a policy would aid in the recruitment of talented women into the field. Thirty-two of 99 Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery program directors responded to the survey. Of the 32 program directors that responded (32% response rate), 75% would allow the pregnant trainee flexibility in rotation schedule. Finally, 75% of program directors support development of a national policy, and 81% would incorporate one into their program.\nThere is compelling interest to establish radiation safety guidelines for the pregnant trainee or vascular surgeon. Consideration should be given at the Society leadership level to develop and support radiation safety guidelines for all vascular surgeons.",

    "abstract": "There has been an increasing awareness of the superiority of native arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) over prosthetic grafts for dialysis access. Many AVFs fail to mature, however, and others develop stenosis while in use. There is growing experience in treating these patients in the interventional suite with percutaneous balloon angioplasty. These procedures, however, are expensive, uncomfortable, and inconvenient for patients and physicians, and involve exposure to radiation and intravenous contrast in patients who are often not on dialysis. This study reviews our experience with ultrasound-guided angioplasty of AVFs in the office setting.\nA retrospective review was performed of all patients treated in our practice with ultrasound-guided AVF angioplasty, from May 2009 to April 2011. The need for intervention was determined by examination and duplex ultrasound. All patients referred to the practice with failing or nonmaturing AVFs were treated in the office under ultrasound guidance, unless a central venous stenosis was suspected. All procedures were performed with the patient under local anesthesia by a single surgeon, and preprocedure, periprocedure, and postprocedure ultrasounds were performed in a single vascular laboratory.\nThere were 31 AVFs in 30 patients in the study. Fifty-five interventions were performed, 48 for AVFs failing to mature and seven for stenosis in functioning AFVs. The 90-day patency was 93%. The overall complication rate was 11%. Two patients had proximal stenosis that could not be crossed (one patient required surgical revision and one patient refused further treatment and thrombosed). There were four perifistular hematomas; three of these resulted in AFV thrombosis. No patients required hospitalization or urgent surgical intervention. Eighty-five percent of patients treated for AVF failing to mature achieved a functional fistula.\nAVF intervention can be performed safely and effectively under ultrasound guidance in the office setting and is a valuable tool in the management of dialysis access patients.",

    "abstract": "Retrograde ascending aortic dissection (rAAD) is a potential complication of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), yet little data exist regarding its occurrence. This study examines the incidence, etiology, and outcome of this event.\nA prospective institutional database was used to identify cases of acute rAAD following TEVAR from a cohort of 309 consecutive procedures from March 2005 (date of initial Food and Drug Administration approval) to September 2010. The database was analyzed for the complication of rAAD as well as relevant patient and operative variables.\nThe incidence of rAAD was 1.9% (6/309); all cases occurred with proximal landing zone in the ascending aorta and/or arch (zones 0-2). All were identified in the perioperative period (range, 0-6 days) with 33% (2/6) 30-day/in-hospital mortality. Eighty-three percent (5/6) underwent emergent repair; one patient died without repair. rAAD patients were similar to the non-rAAD group (n = 303) across pertinent variables, including age, gender, race, and device size (all P > .1). rAAD incidence by aortic pathology was 1.0% (2/200) for aneurysm, 4.4% (4/91) for dissection, and 0% (0/18) for transection; P = .08. rAAD incidence by device was TAG (Gore) 1.0% (2/205), Talent (Medtronic) 4.7% (2/43), and Zenith TX2 (Cook) 3.6% (2/55). rAAD incidence was observed to be higher among patients with an ascending aortic diameter \u2265 4.0 cm (4.8% vs 0.9% for ascending diameter <4.0 cm); P = .047. Incidence was also higher with proximal landing zone in the native ascending aorta (zone 0) 6.9% (2/29) versus 1.4% for all others (4/280); P = .101. For patients with dissection pathology and an ascending aortic diameter \u2265 4.0 cm, 11% (3/28) suffered rAAD; with the combination of native ascending aorta (zone 0) landing zone measuring \u2265 4.0 cm, the incidence was 25% (2/8). Definitive diagnosis was by computed tomography angiography (n = 1), intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (n = 3), intraoperative arteriography (n = 1), or postmortem autopsy (n = 1).\nrAAD is a lethal early complication of TEVAR, which may be more common when treating dissection, with devices utilizing proximal bare springs or barbs for fixation, with native zone 0 proximal landing zone and with ascending aortic diameter \u2265 4 cm. Combinations of these risk factors may be particularly high risk. Intraoperative imaging assessment of the ascending aorta should be conducted following TEVAR to avoid under-recognition. National database reporting of this complication is needed to ensure safety and proper application of emerging TEVAR technology.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the changes of the aortic diameter at the suprarenal and infrarenal segment after open repair (OR) and endovascular repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).\nThis was a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing AAA repair between 1997 and 2008. Inclusion criteria were at least 3 months of follow-up at our institution, elective aneurysm repair, and absence of false, mycotic, or inflammatory aneurysms. For EVAR, standard computed tomography (CT) scans from follow-up were used; in the OR group, CT scans performed for unrelated nonvascular indications were used. Diameters of the aorta were measured at the first slice below the lowest renal artery and at the first slice above the highest renal artery. A 2-mm change was defined as measurable aortic neck dilatation.\nInclusion criteria were met by 46 patients in the OR group and 103 in the EVAR group. After a follow-up of 34.1 months (range, 5.5-131.7 months) in the OR group and 39.4 months (range, 3-108.9 months) in the EVAR group, the mean changes were 1.75 \u00b1 3.50 mm (OR) and 0.9 \u00b1 2.3 mm (EVAR; P = .305) in the suprarenal diameters and 0.8 \u00b1 2.9 mm (OR) and 1.2 \u00b1 2.5 mm (EVAR; P = .311) in the infrarenal diameters. The absolute suprarenal vs infrarenal sizes were 29.7 \u00b1 7.1 and 28.7 \u00b1 6.8 mm in the OR group and 28.7 \u00b1 3.2 and 28.5 \u00b1 3.6 mm, respectively, in the EVAR group (suprarenal, P = .749; infrarenal, P = .273). Increase of the aortic diameter >2 mm, defined as aortic neck dilatation, was found in 23 of 103 EVAR patients (22.3% \u00b1 0.862%), and in nine of 46 OR patients (19.57% \u00b1 0.484%; P = .870). Increase in the suprarenal change >2 mm occurred in 21 of 103 EVAR patients (20.39% \u00b1 1.04%) and in 14 of 46 OR patients (30.4% \u00b1 0.446%; P = .260). Reintervention rate of patients with an increase >2 mm was 31% (seven of 23) in EVAR and 11.1% (one of nine) in the OR group (P = .386).\nThe AAA groups treated with EVAR or OR demonstrated similar increases of aneurysmal neck diameters. This suggests that aortic neck dilatation may be caused by a natural progression of the disease rather than by deviating therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the accuracy of central luminal line (CLL) measurements in quantifying stent graft migration. The bias of the CLL technique together with observer variability were assessed.\nStent grafts were deployed in plastic aortic phantoms at fixed locations from two side branches. Each phantom was filled with iodinated contrast, and a 2-mm multislice computed tomography (CT) scan was performed. The stent graft was then displaced caudally, its new location determined, and again, a CT scan performed. This created a series of 15 cases with known stent graft migration. CLLs were used to measure stent graft position on the CT scans and calculate migration (3 observers). In vivo stent graft migration was then evaluated in a similar manner using a series of follow-up CT scans from nine patients (2 observers). All CLL measurements were performed independently and were repeated on a separate occasion.\nThe mean difference in CLL migration between the actual and observed measurements (bias) in the aortic phantoms was <1 mm. The 95% confidence intervals for the bias were within the interval (-1 and 1 mm), and the 95% limits of agreement were within -3 mm and +3 mm. The 95% limits of agreement for measurements within and between observers were -4 to 2 mm and -2 to 2 mm, respectively. The phantom study generated a coefficient of repeatability (RC) of 1 mm for within-observer measurements. Clinically, CLLs generated 95% limits of agreement within and between observers of -3 to 4 mm (RC, 2 mm) and -3 to +3 mm, respectively.\nBias from CLL-determined migration is small and insignificant from a practical point of view. A small amount of measurement variability within and between observers does exist; it should be feasible to detect changes in stent graft position that are \u22654 mm.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the longitudinal changes in renal volume after renal artery stenting (RAS) to determine if renal mass is preserved by stenting.\nThe study cohort consisted of 38 patients with longitudinal imaging available for renal volume quantification before and after RAS. Renal volume was estimated as (kidney length) \u00d7 (width) \u00d7 (depth/2) based on preoperative renal imaging. For each patient, the clinical response of blood pressure (BP) and renal function to RAS was categorized according to modified American Heart Association guidelines. Changes in renal volume were assessed using paired nonparametric analyses.\nThe cohort was a median age of 69 years (interquartile range [IQR], 60-74 years). A favorable BP response was observed in 11 of 38 patients (28.9%). At a median interval between imaging studies of 21 months (IQR, 13-32 months), ipsilateral renal volume was significantly increased from baseline (146.8 vs 133.8 cm(3);P = .02). This represents a 6.9% relative increase in ipsilateral kidney volume from baseline. A significant negative correlation between preoperative renal volume and the relative change in renal volume postoperatively (r = -0.42; P = .0055) suggests that smaller kidneys experienced the greatest gains in renal volume after stenting. It is noteworthy that the 25 patients with no change in BP or renal function-clinical failures using traditional definitions-experienced a 12% relative increase in ipsilateral renal volume after RAS. Multivariate analysis determined that stable or improved renal volume after stenting was an independent predictor of stable or improved long-term renal function (odds ratio, 0.008; 95% confidence interval, 0.000-0.206; P = .004).\nThese data lend credence to the belief that RAS preserves renal mass in some patients. This benefit of RAS even extends to those patients who would be considered treatment failures by traditional definitions. Patients with stable or increased renal volume after RAS had more stable renal function during long-term follow-up, whereas patients with renal volume loss after stenting were prone to deterioration of renal function.",

Two independent observers selected studies for inclusion, assessed the quality of the included studies, and performed the data extraction. Studies were selected based on specific predefined criteria. Outcomes were technical success (successfully completed procedure with endograft patency, preservation of target vessels, and no evidence of type I or III endoleak at postprocedural imaging), 30-day mortality, all-cause mortality, branch vessel patency, renal impairment, and secondary interventions. Between-study heterogeneity was calculated using I(2) statistics. Pooled estimates were calculated using a fixed-effects (I(2) <25%) or a random-effects (I(2) >25% to <50%) model.\nNine studies were included reporting 629 patients who underwent F-EVAR for a pararenal AAA, of which 1622 target vessels were incorporated in an endograft design. Between-study heterogeneity was \u2264 41% for all outcomes. The pooled estimate (95% confidence interval [CI] was 90.4% (87.7%-92.5%) for technical success, 2.1% (1.2%-3.7%) for 30-day mortality, and 16% (12.5%-20.4%) for all-cause mortality. Follow-up was 15 to 25 months. The pooled estimate (95% CI) during follow-up was 93.2% (90.4%-95.3%) for branch vessel patency, 22.2% (16%-30.1%) for renal impairment, and 17.8% (13.5%-22.6%) for secondary interventions.\nPromising immediate and midterm results (up to 2 years) support F-EVAR as a feasible, safe, and effective treatment in a relatively high-risk cohort of patients with pararenal AAAs.",

    "abstract": "The long-term results of treating chronic aortic dissections and aneurysms in association with dissections with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) are unknown, and the timing for intervention is uncertain. We evaluated the morphology of stent graft and aorta remodeling and the volumetric changes in these patients after successful TEVAR.\nSerial computed tomography scans of 32 patients who underwent TEVAR for uncomplicated chronic dissections (group A, n = 17) and chronic dissections with aneurysms (group B, n = 15) were analyzed at 1, 6, 12, and 36 months. Stent graft diameter changes and positional migration were assessed three-dimensionally using Mimics 14.0 (Materialize, Leuven, Belgium). Volumetric data for true lumen, false lumen, thrombus load, and aortic size were measured by Aquarius iNtuition 4.4 software (TeraRecon, San Mateo, Calif). Results were compared between the two groups and with stent graft diameter, length, and oversizing.\nAortic stent grafts remodeled progressively, with inlet area increasing 4.4%, 10.1%, and 14.2% and outlet area increasing 42.6%, 67.2%, and 72.3%, respectively, at 6, 12, and 36 months. True lumen volume increased progressively in group A (114 to 174 mL) and group B (124 to 190 mL) from baseline to 36 months. False lumen volume decreased in group A (150 to 88 mL) and group B (351 to 250 mL), whereas thrombus load in the false lumen increased from 73% to 80% in group A and 84% to 87% in group B in 3 years. Eight patients (4 in each group) showed an increase in total aortic volume of >10%, 12 showed a static volume, and 12 showed shrinkage. Aortic volume change had no relationship to pathology, stent graft sizing, and thrombus load but was positively associated with the placement of a longer graft. A small but progressive distal migration of stent grafts was noted in all patients (3.1, 4.5, and 5.1 mm at 6, 12, and 36 months) but was more prominent in shorter stent grafts (\u2264 162 mm). No deaths, rupture, or secondary interventions occurred during follow-up.\nAortic remodeling after TEVAR in chronic dissection is a continuous process. There were no significant differences between chronic dissections and aneurysms in all volumetric parameters. Treating chronic dissections early, before aneurysm formation, did not appear to have a morphologic advantage.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the trend in inpatient vascular procedures in the United States over the past decade and predict the future demand for vascular surgeons.\nThe Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried to determine the weighted national estimates of inpatient vascular procedures performed on adult patients (age \u2265 18) between 1997 and 2008. Using population estimates from the United States Census Bureau, the per capita rates of inpatient procedures were calculated for age-specific groups (18-64 years, 65-84 years, and \u2265 85 years). The change in per capita rates over the past decade along with population forecasts were used to predict future workload.\nThere was a net increase of 22% from 971,046 inpatient vascular procedures for all adults in 1997 to 1,188,332 in 2008. During the same time period, the adult population increased by 16% from 198 to 230 million. The age-stratified per capita rates of all vascular procedures were +21% for age 18 to 64; -4% for age 65 to 84; and +18% for age \u2265 85. This resulted in a net increase of 5% (490 to 515 procedures per 100,000 capita) in the per capita rate for all adults. Based on the assumption that trends in age-specific rates remain constant, there is a predicted inpatient workload increase (compared to 2008) of 18% by 2015, 34% by 2020, and 72% by 2030. The vascular workload is predicted to more than double by the year 2040.\nDespite a conservative approach of using a population-based analysis of only inpatient procedures, there is a dramatic increase in the predicted vascular workload for the future. The vascular surgery training process will need to adapt to ensure an adequate number of fellowship-trained vascular surgeons is available to provide quality vascular care in the future.",

    "abstract": "Resistin, an adipocytokine, plays a potential role in cardiovascular disease and may contribute to increased atherosclerotic risk by modulating the activity of endothelial cells. A growing body of evidence suggests that aspirin is a potent antioxidant. We investigated whether aspirin mitigates resistin-induced endothelial dysfunction via modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and explored the role that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a negative regulator of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, plays in the suppressive effects of aspirin on resistin-induced endothelial dysfunction.\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pretreated with various doses of aspirin (10-500 \u03bcg/mL) for 2 hours and then incubated with resistin (100 ng/mL) for an additional 48 hours. Fluorescence produced by the oxidation of dihydroethidium (DHE) was used to quantify the production of superoxide in situ; superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities were determined by an enzymatic assay; and protein levels of AMPK-mediated downstream signaling were investigated by Western blot.\nTreatment of HUVECs with resistin for 48 hours resulted in a 2.9-fold increase in superoxide production; however, pretreatment with aspirin resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in production of superoxide (10-500 \u03bcg/mL; n = 3 experiments; all P < .05). Resistin also suppressed the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase by nearly 50%; that result, however, was not observed in HUVECs that had been pretreated with aspirin at a concentration of 500 \u03bcg/mL. The membrane translocation assay showed that the levels of NADPH oxidase subunits p47(phox)and Rac-1 in membrane fractions of HUVECs were threefold to fourfold higher in cells that had been treated with resistin for 1 hour than in untreated cells; however, pretreatment with aspirin markedly inhibited resistin-induced membrane assembly of NADPH oxidase via modulating AMPK-suppressed PKC-\u03b1 activation. Application of AMPK\u03b11-specific siRNA resulted in increased activation of PKC-\u03b1 and p47(phox). In addition, resistin significantly decreased AMPK-mediated downstream Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)/nitric oxide (NO) signaling and induced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, which in turn activated NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory responses such as the release of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, the overexpression of adhesion molecules, and stimulation of monocytic THP-1 cell attachment to HUVECs (2.5-fold vs control; n = 3 experiments). Furthermore, resistin downregulated eNOS and upregulated inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression, thereby augmenting the formation of NO and protein nitrosylation. Pretreatment with aspirin, however, exerted significant cytoprotective effects in a dose-dependent manner (P < .05).\nOur findings suggest a direct connection between adipocytokines and endothelial dysfunction and provide further insight into the protective effects of aspirin in obese individuals with endothelial dysfunction.",

    "results": "Treatment of HUVECs with resistin for 48 hours resulted in a 2.9-fold increase in superoxide production; however, pretreatment with aspirin resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in production of superoxide (10-500 \u03bcg/mL; n = 3 experiments; all P < .05). Resistin also suppressed the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase by nearly 50%; that result, however, was not observed in HUVECs that had been pretreated with aspirin at a concentration of 500 \u03bcg/mL. The membrane translocation assay showed that the levels of NADPH oxidase subunits p47(phox)and Rac-1 in membrane fractions of HUVECs were threefold to fourfold higher in cells that had been treated with resistin for 1 hour than in untreated cells; however, pretreatment with aspirin markedly inhibited resistin-induced membrane assembly of NADPH oxidase via modulating AMPK-suppressed PKC-\u03b1 activation. Application of AMPK\u03b11-specific siRNA resulted in increased activation of PKC-\u03b1 and p47(phox). In addition, resistin significantly decreased AMPK-mediated downstream Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)/nitric oxide (NO) signaling and induced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, which in turn activated NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory responses such as the release of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, the overexpression of adhesion molecules, and stimulation of monocytic THP-1 cell attachment to HUVECs (2.5-fold vs control; n = 3 experiments). Furthermore, resistin downregulated eNOS and upregulated inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression, thereby augmenting the formation of NO and protein nitrosylation. Pretreatment with aspirin, however, exerted significant cytoprotective effects in a dose-dependent manner (P < .05).",

    "abstract": "The lack of readily available branched and fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) options has created an opportunity for creative deployment of endograft components to treat juxtarenal aneurysms. We present our early experience with \"snorkel\" or \"chimney\" techniques in the endovascular management of complex aortic aneurysms.\nWe retrospectively reviewed planned snorkel procedures for juxtarenal aneurysms performed from September 2009 to August 2011. Our standardized technique included axillary or brachial cutdown for delivery of covered snorkel stents and mostly percutaneous femoral access for the main body endograft.\nFifty-six snorkel grafts were successfully placed in 28 consecutive patients (mean age, 75 years) with juxtarenal aneurysms. Mean aneurysm size was 64.8 mm (range, 53-87 mm). The snorkel configuration extended the proximal seal zone from an unsuitable infrarenal neck for standard EVAR (median diameter, 33.5 mm; length, 0.0 mm) to a median neck diameter of 24.5 mm and length of 18.0 mm. Five patients had unilateral renal snorkels, 17 had bilateral renal snorkels, and six had celiac/superior mesenteric artery/renal combinations. Technical success of snorkel placements was 98.2%, with loss of wire access leading to one renal stent deployment failure. Thirty-day mortality was 7.1%: one patient was readmitted 1 week postoperatively with pneumonia and died of sepsis; one patient died at 1 week of a right hemispheric stroke. Other major complications included perinephric hematomas, 7.1%; permanent hemodialysis, 3.6%; iliac artery injury requiring endoconduit placement, 3.6%; and brachial plexus nerve injury, 3.6%. Cardiac complications included self-limited arrhythmias (14.3%) and one non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (3.6%), with all recovering without coronary intervention. Mean follow-up was 10.7 months (range, 3-25 months). One patient died of nonaneurysmal-related causes at 3 months (89.3% survival). Postoperative imaging revealed one renal snorkel graft occlusion occurring at 3 months (98.2% overall primary patency). Seven (25%) early endoleaks were noted on the first follow-up computed tomography angiography: two type I, three type II, and two type III (25%), leading to one secondary intervention (3.6%) with bridging cuff placement (type III). The small type Ia endoleaks and other type III endoleak resolved at the 6-month scan. Mean sac regression at the latest follow-up was 7.3 mm. No aneurysm has enlarged on postoperative imaging.\nEarly success with the snorkel technique for juxtarenal aneurysms has made it our procedure of choice for complex short-neck to no-neck EVAR. Although long-term follow-up is needed, the flexibility of the snorkel technique and lack of requirement for custom-built devices may make this approach more attractive than branched or fenestrated stent grafts.",

    "abstract": "Whether a typical patient and symptom profile is associated with proximal or distal lesions in lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is unknown. Knowing which patient characteristics, exertional leg symptoms, and cardiovascular risk profile accompany the anatomic lesion location may facilitate a more tailor-made management of PAD.\nThis cross-sectional study comprised 701 patients from two vascular surgery outpatient clinics with new-onset symptoms of PAD (Fontaine 2) who underwent duplex ultrasound (DUS) examinations from March 2006 to March 2011. The main outcome measures were patient characteristics, self-reported leg symptoms, and cardiovascular risk factors as documented from questionnaires and medical records. Peripheral lesion information, categorized by proximal and distal lesions, was obtained from DUS examinations. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed of proximal vs nonproximal lesions, distal vs nondistal lesions, and proximal and distal vs absence of having both lesions to assess relationships between patient characteristics, leg symptom categories (typical vs atypical leg symptoms), cardiovascular risk factors, and anatomic lesion location.\nLesions were proximal in 270 (38.5%), distal in 441 (62.9%), and proximal and distal in 94 (13.4%). Patients with proximal lesions were younger (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; P < .0001) and less likely to be obese (OR, 0.34; P < .0001) than those without proximal lesions. Older age (OR, 1.07; P < .0001), male sex (OR, 1.96; P = .003), being without a partner (OR, 2.24; P = .004), and lower anxiety scores (OR, 0.42; P = .003) were associated with distal lesions. Patients with both lesions were more likely to be single (OR, 2.30; P = .010) and less likely to be obese (OR, 0.24; P = .009). No distinguishing leg symptom pattern was observed for patients with proximal lesions. Intermittent claudication was more frequently reported in those with distal lesions (P = .011). Although buttock and thigh pain seemed to be somewhat more present in proximal lesions (P < .01) and calf pain more in distal lesions (P < .001), patients still reported pain at a variety of levels throughout their legs, regardless of the anatomic lesion location.\nTwo distinctive PAD phenotypes-each with its own characteristics and risk factors-emerged by anatomic lesion location; however, PAD-specific leg symptoms did not always reflect the anatomic lesion location. These findings may open new opportunities to better tailor PAD management to these two PAD subgroups and may raise awareness about not relying on self-reported symptoms to guide further diagnostic imaging and peripheral lesion management.",

    "abstract": "Initial TransAtlantic Inter-Society consensus (TASC) II classification has been shown to influence the patency of stented femoral and popliteal arteries. Although several studies have shown the effect of the number of runoff vessels on the durability of infrainguinal angioplasty without stenting, the influence of tibial vessel runoff on the patency of primarily stented femoral and popliteal arteries has not been as well defined. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the number of patent tibial vessels affects primary patency after primary stenting of the femoral and popliteal arteries.\nThe records of all patients undergoing angioplasty and primary nitinol stenting of the femoral and popliteal arteries, by or under the supervision of one vascular surgeon, were reviewed. Results were analyzed by both the number of patent tibial vessels documented on periprocedural angiography and by using a modified Society for Vascular Surgery runoff score. TASC II classification was also recorded. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted and differences between groups tested by log-rank method. Fisher exact and \u03c7(2) tests were used to compare categoric factors.\nDuring a 7-year period, 289 limbs in 236 patients underwent primary stenting of the femoral and popliteal arteries. Overall primary patency was 70.3% at 12 months, 52.4% at 24 months, and 39.1% at 36 months. Limbs classified as TASC A or B had significantly better patency rates than those classified as TASC C or D (P < .001). While the number of runoff vessels decreased with worsening of the TASC classification (P = .024), overall (P = .355), and within individual TASC classes (P \u2265 .092 for each), there was no difference in the primary patency of stented segments with good runoff and those with compromised runoff. Limbs with poor runoff (one or no vessels) were no more likely to fail with occlusion than their counterparts with two or three patent tibial vessels (P = .383). The number of patent tibial vessels at the time of initial stenting did not impact ultimate limb salvage (P = .063).\nThe number of patent tibial vessels does not influence the primary patency of primarily stented femoral and popliteal arteries. TASC II classification appears to be significantly more predictive of initial failure after angioplasty and stenting of these vessels.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the results of thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) for chronic descending thoracic aortic (DTA) dissections with aneurysmal degeneration.\nOver 70 months at a single institution, 27 patients underwent TEVAR for aneurysms related to chronic (>6 weeks) DTA dissections.\nMean patient age was 67.5 \u00b1 9.6 years; 18 were men. Primary indications for repair were aneurysm size (n = 20), rapid aneurysmal growth (n = 5), saccular aneurysm (n = 1), and rupture (n = 1). Preoperative false lumen status was patent in 18 patients, partially thrombosed in 8 patients, and unknown in the patient whose aneurysm ruptured. The proximal entry tear was covered in all 27 patients. Fourteen patients required coverage of the left subclavian artery, of which 9 patients underwent prophylactic revascularization. On completion angiogram, no patient had antegrade perfusion of the aneurysmal false lumen. There were three procedural complications: 2 patients sustained paraparesis (one resolved and one improved), and 1 patient had an access injury requiring stent graft placement. Thirty-day mortality was 3.7% (1 of 27); the one death was in the patient whose aneurysm ruptured. Of the 26 surviving patients, 23 (88.5%) had thrombosis of the aneurysmal false lumen. Twenty-two patients (84.6%) had stability or decrease in maximal aneurysm diameter on last radiographic follow-up at 18 \u00b1 20 months. Three-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 90.3% \u00b1 6.5% in the 26 patients who survived to hospital discharge, with a mean follow-up of 27.3 \u00b1 22.1 months. In patients with preoperatively partially thrombosed false lumens (n = 8), 3-year survival was 100%.\nTEVAR for aneurysms due to chronic dissections of the DTA can be performed safely and effectively at midterm follow-up according to this single-institution study. Stent graft therapy may be of particular benefit in patients presenting with partially thrombosed false lumens.",

    "abstract": "The Protected Carotid Artery Stenting in Patients at High Risk for Carotid Endarterectomy (PROTECT) study was performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of two devices for carotid artery stenting (CAS) in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis in patients at high risk for carotid endarterectomy (CEA): (1) a new embolic protection device, the Emboshield Pro (Abbott Vascular, Abbott Park, Ill), using the periprocedural composite end point of 30-day death, stroke, and myocardial infarction (DSMI), and (2) a carotid stent in conjunction with an embolic protection device (EPD) using the DSMI periprocedural composite end point plus ipsilateral stroke at up to 3 years for long-term evaluation.\nThis prospective, multicenter clinical trial enrolled 220 consecutive participants between November 29, 2006, and January 14, 2008, followed by a second cohort of 102 participants between January 14 and June 18, 2008. Enrolled participants had carotid stenosis (symptomatic >50% or asymptomatic >80%). The first 220 subjects underwent distal EPD placement with a new large-diameter filter, and the second cohort of 102 underwent placement of an older EPD that is no longer manufactured. All 322 participants were to be treated with a dedicated carotid stent with a tapered, small, closed-cell design (Xact; Abbott Vascular) and were to be included in the long-term evaluation. Independent neurologic assessment was performed before CAS and at 1 day, 30 days, and annually after CAS. All primary end point events were independently adjudicated by a central committee.\nThe periprocedural composite end point of DSMI (95% confidence interval) in the first 220 participants was 2.3% (0.74%, 5.22%), with a combined death and stroke rate of 1.8% (0.50%, 4.59%) and a rate of death and major stroke of 0.5% (0.01%, 2.51%). As of January 3, 2011, the median follow-up for the entire 322-subject cohort for the long-term evaluation was 2.8 years.

Management of graft limb thrombosis requires restoration of inflow and correction of any causative outflow lesions. Successful, minimally invasive inflow restoration with catheter thrombectomy can become problematic if assessment of technical adequacy is deficient or reveals causal lesions within the graft body. We describe a case illustrating the potential shortfall of retrograde graft limb completion angiography in depicting neointimal flaps, the benefit of antegrade angiography in depicting these flaps, and a novel utilization of a standard endovascular method to correct flaps that involve the graft body.",

    "abstract": "Patients with juxtarenal, pararenal, or thoracoabdominal aneurysms require complex surgical open repair, which is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. The \"chimney graft\" or \"snorkel\" technique has evolved as a potential alternative to fenestrated and side-branched endografts. The purpose of this study is to review all published reports on chimney graft (CG) technique involving visceral vessels and investigate the safety and efficacy of the technique.\nStudies were included in the present review if visceral revascularization during endovascular treatment of aortic pathologies was achieved via a CG implantation. Reports on the chimney technique for aortic arch branches revascularization were excluded. A multiple electronic health database search was performed on all articles published until April 2011.\nThe electronic literature search yielded 15 reports that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A total of 93 patients (81.3% male; mean age, 71.9 \u00b1 0.9 years) were analyzed. In 77.4% of the patients, the CG procedure was applied for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Out of the 93 patients, 24.7% were operated on in an urgent setting (symptomatic or ruptured aneurysm). A total of 134 CGs were implanted: 108 to the renal arteries, 20 to the superior mesenteric artery, five to the celiac trunk, and one to the inferior mesenteric artery. In 57 patients, a single CG was deployed; in 32 patients, two CGs; in three patients, three CGs; and in one patient, four CGs were deployed. Ninety-four percent of CGs were directed proximally, whereas 6.0% were directed caudally. Primary technical success was achieved in all patients. A total of 13 patients (14.0%) developed a type I endoleak. Three were detected and treated intraoperatively. Postoperatively, 10 type I endoleaks were revealed, four of which required secondary intervention. During a mean follow-up period of 9.0 \u00b1 1.0 months, 131 of 134 (97.8%) CGs remained patent. Two CGs to the renal arteries and one to the superior mesenteric artery occluded. Postoperatively, 11.8% of patients suffered renal function impairment and 2.1% a myocardial infarction. Ischemic stroke presented in 3.2% of patients. The 30-day in-hospital mortality was 4.3%.\nThe role of the chimney technique in the management of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms is still unclear. This technique has relatively good results, considering the anatomic limitations of the aortic neck. However, long-term endograft durability and proximal fixation remains a significant concern. Thus, there is a reasonable hesitation to embrace the method for widespread use in the absence of long-term data.",

    "abstract": "Creating an experimental model of a type B aortic dissection with a minimally invasive endovascular procedure in swine to help future evaluation of therapies for aortic dissection.\nAortic dissection was created in 14 swine using endovascular procedures only. Under fluoroscopy, a modified 10F outer catheter with a 14 G stiffening inner metallic cannula was forced via the femoral artery into the aortic vessel wall to create an initial dissection. A .035-inch guidewire and a 4F straight catheter were advanced into the dissected space, and the dissection was extended in a retrograde direction using a technique including loop formation of the guidewire, which was placed carefully against the transmural penetration and extended as far as possible in the descending thoracic aorta up to the point where loop formation of the guidewire reached smoothly. An 8F introducer sheath was advanced with a Brockenbrough needle into the dissected space, and a proximal fenestration was created by puncturing the intima. If required, balloon dilatation was performed to enlarge the proximal and distal tears. Aortography and contrast-enhanced cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) were performed in addition to a detailed histologic evaluation of the dissected portion.\nAortic dissection was successfully created in 11 of the 14 swine (78.6%). Among the 11 dissections, nine were located in the thoracoabdominal aorta and two in the abdominal aorta. The initial aortic diameter at the middle portion of the created dissection ranged from 7.4 to 16.8 mm (mean \u00b1 standard deviation, 10.9 \u00b1 2.9), while after dissection, it ranged from 7.8 to 19.3 mm (12.9 \u00b1 3.8 mm). The dissected length ranged from 4.4 to 17.7 cm (10.7 \u00b1 4.6 cm). Aortography and CBCT revealed seven dissections (63.6%) with a smooth and patent false lumen. Histologic evaluation revealed that the outer one-third of the media was separated from the inner two-thirds. In the remaining four dissections (36.4%), imaging procedures revealed the formation of a rough and patent false lumen beside the true lumen, and histologic evaluation revealed greater separation of the outer media. Five animals were chronic dissection models. Three (60%) of these survived for more than 14 days without any symptoms. Moreover, completely patent true and false lumens without thrombus formation were observed in these three animals. The aortic diameter at the dissected portion tended to be dilated compared with the initial diameter.\nThis new technique of creating an experimental aortic dissection model in swine is promising and should contribute to the development of future therapies for aortic dissection.",

    "abstract": "There are many recent and ongoing changes in the practice of medicine from a business standpoint as well as in overall practice management. Economic and lifestyle desires have pushed many physicians to a decision point of whether or not to join a large multispecialty group or to sell their practice and become an employee of a hospital system. There are advantages and disadvantages to both options; however, deciding on the most appropriate path for each individual can be a daunting task. At our recent breakfast session at the vascular annual meeting in Chicago, Illinois, in June 2011, we brought to light these topics to try and help enlighten physicians on which option may be right for them. There is no single answer/option that will fit every practice, but discussion for various practice management designs are outlined and critiqued. This article cannot fully discuss each view in the allotted space, but it is designed to encourage thought and discussion among the vascular surgical community as a whole.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients undergoing elective repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and the longitudinal trends in surgical management (open repair vs endovascular aneurysm repair [EVAR]), factors associated with the choice of surgical technique, and differences in the rate of in-hospital mortality at a single large-volume Canadian center.\nThis retrospective cohort study used data from a prospectively collected vascular surgery database and reviewed all patients undergoing elective repair of an infrarenal AAA over a recent 10-year period (June 2000-May 2010). Information was reviewed regarding surgical techniques, patient demographics, and short-term outcomes. Subsequent analysis included univariate statistics and multivariable logistic regression with data presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nA total of 1942 patients underwent elective AAA repair over this 10-year study period, 1067 (54.9%) via open repair and 875 (45.1%) via EVAR. The proportion of patients undergoing EVAR was significantly higher in the latter half of the study period compared to the first half (55.8% vs 33.9%; P < .01). Older patients (75 vs 71; P < .01) and those with higher American Society of Anesthesiologists classifications (P < .01) were more likely to receive endovascular repair than open repair. The overall in-hospital mortality rate in the entire cohort was low (2.3% for EVAR and 3.9% for open repair), and after multivariable logistic regression and adjustment for preoperative factors, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with open AAA repair (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.04-3.13; P = .04).\nThis 10-year analysis shows a significant shift toward an endovascular approach in the repair of infrarenal AAAs at our Canadian center. Similar to other jurisdictions, higher risk and older patients are more likely to be treated with an endovascular repair resulting in a survival advantage in these patients compared to standard open repair.",

The proportion of patients undergoing EVAR was significantly higher in the latter half of the study period compared to the first half (55.8% vs 33.9%; P < .01). Older patients (75 vs 71; P < .01) and those with higher American Society of Anesthesiologists classifications (P < .01) were more likely to receive endovascular repair than open repair. The overall in-hospital mortality rate in the entire cohort was low (2.3% for EVAR and 3.9% for open repair), and after multivariable logistic regression and adjustment for preoperative factors, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with open AAA repair (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.04-3.13; P = .04).",

    "abstract": "Venous thromboembolism is a significant cause of morbidity and death in pregnant women. Retrievable vena cava filters were placed right before labor as prophylaxis for peripartum pulmonary embolism. We reviewed the experience of caval filter placement and retrieval in term pregnancy in this study.\nWe reviewed 15 patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremity who underwent OptEase (Cordis Corp, New Brunswick, NJ) retrievable vena cava filter placement. DVT was diagnosed by clinical symptoms and Doppler ultrasound imaging. Subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin was eased 12 hours before cesarean delivery and restarted 12 hours after delivery. The caval filters were placed suprarenally from the jugular approach and retrieved from the femoral approach.\nThe filters were successfully placed in all patients on the day of cesarean delivery. No placement-related complications occurred. The caval filter was left in situ as a permanent device in one patient because the captured thrombus within the filter was not eliminated after the thrombolytic therapy. Filters in other 14 patients were retrieved successfully, without difficulty, including in one patient after complete lysis of captured thrombus by the thrombolytic therapy. Oral warfarin therapy was recommended for at least 3 months after hospital discharge, and for at least 6 months in the patient with a caval filter left in situ. All patients were examined by Doppler ultrasound imaging during the follow-up. None presented with symptomatic pulmonary embolism or filter-related complications.\nOptEase retrievable vena cava filter placement and retrieval in term pregnant patients with extensive DVT of the lower extremities is safe, effective, and feasible. The results in our study may justify prophylactic filter placement use right before labor.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular treatment of superficial femoral artery (SFA) lesions is a well-established practice. The repercussions of failed SFA interventions are unclear. Our goal was to review the efficacy of SFA stenting and define negative effects of its failure.\nA retrospective chart review was conducted from January 2007 to January 2010 that identified 42 limbs in 39 patients that underwent SFA stenting. Follow-up ankle-brachial index and a duplex ultrasound scan was performed at routine intervals.\nMean patient age was 68 years (range, 43-88 years); there were 22 men (56%) and 17 women (44%). Intervention indication was claudication in 15 patients (36%), rest pain in seven patients (17%), and tissue loss in 19 patients (45%). There were 15 patients (36%) with TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) A, nine patients (21%) with TASC B, five patients (12%) with TASC C, and 13 patients (31%) with TASC D lesions. The majority of lesions intervened on were the first attempt at revascularization. Three stents (7.7%) occluded within 30 days. One-year primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency rates were 24%, 44%, and 51%, respectively. Limb salvage was 93% during follow-up. Seventeen interventions failed (40%) at 1 year. Of these, seven patients (41%) developed claudication, seven patients (41%) developed ischemic rest pain, and three patients (18%) were asymptomatic. During follow-up, three patients (7.7%) required bypass and three patients (7.7%) major amputation, one after failed bypass. All limbs requiring bypass or amputation had TASC C/D lesions. Thirty-day and 1-year mortality was 2.6% and 10.3%, respectively.\nInterventions performed for TASC C/D lesions are more likely to fail and more likely to lead to bypass or amputation. Interventions performed for TASC C/D lesions that fail have a negative impact on limb salvage. This should be considered when performing stenting of advanced SFA lesions.",

    "abstract": "Paclitaxel coating of hemodialysis grafts is effective in suppressing neointimal hyperplasia in the graft and vascular anastomosis sites. However, paclitaxel can have unwanted effects on the surrounding tissues. To reduce such problems, we developed a method to coat the drug only on the luminal surface of the graft, with little loading on the outer surface.\nA peristaltic pump and a double-solvent (water and acetone) system were used to achieve an inner coating of paclitaxel. At the ratio of 90% acetone, paclitaxel was homogeneously coated only on the luminal surface of the graft without changing the physical properties. To determine its effect, grafts were implanted between the common carotid artery and the external jugular vein in pigs using uncoated control grafts (n = 6) and low-dose (n = 6, 0.22 \u03bcg/mm(2)) and high-dose (n = 6, 0.69 \u03bcg/mm(2)) paclitaxel inner-coated grafts. Cross-sections of graft-venous anastomoses were analyzed histomorphometrically 6 weeks after placement to measure the patency rate, percentage of luminal stenosis, and neointimal area.\nNo signs of infection or bacterial contamination were observed in the paclitaxel inner-coated groups. Only one of the six control grafts was patent, but all of the paclitaxel-coated grafts were patent, with little neointima. The mean \u00b1 standard error values of percentage luminal stenosis were 75.7% \u00b1 12.7% (control), 17.5% \u00b1 3.1% (low dose), and 19.7% \u00b1 3.0% (high dose). The values for the neointimal area (in mm(2)) were 8.77 \u00b1 1.66 (control), 3.53 \u00b1 0.73 (lose dose), and 4.24 \u00b1 0.99 (high dose). Compared with the control group, paclitaxel inner-coated vascular grafts significantly suppressed neointimal hyperplasia (low dose, P = .001; high dose, P = .002). Myofibroblast proliferation and migration into the graft interstices confirmed the firm attachment of the implanted graft to the surrounding tissue.\nPaclitaxel coating on the inner luminal surface of vascular grafts was effective in suppressing neointimal hyperplasia, with little inhibition of myofibroblast infiltration within the graft wall.",

    "abstract": "Most reports of femoral-femoral bypass (FFB) were published before the era of endovascular intervention. This study examines the utilization and impact of adjunctive endovascular intervention on FFB in contemporary practice.\nWe reviewed 253 FFB performed in 247 patients between 1984 and 2010. Primary endpoints, including graft patency, primary-assisted patency, limb salvage, and survival, were assessed using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine predictors of primary endpoints.\nThe indication for FFB included claudication (27%; n = 69) and critical limb ischemia (72%; n = 184). Forty-eight patients (19%) were treated urgently for acute ischemia. Mean follow-up was 5.6 \u00b1 5.5 years. Over the study interval, adjunctive iliac percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA)/stent placement increased significantly from 0% to 54% (P trend < .001), while the rate of axillofemoral bypass or no inflow procedure decreased from 100% to 46% (P trend < .001). Despite increased utilization, iliac PTA/stenting was associated with decreased 5-year primary graft patency of 44% compared with 74% for axillofemoral bypass patients and 71% in patients with no adjunctive inflow procedure (P = .004). Patients with inflow iliac PTA/stents also had diminished 5-year assisted primary patency of 61% compared with 85% for axillofemoral bypass patients and 87% in patients without inflow revascularization (P = .002). Adjunctive iliac PTA/stenting did not impact limb salvage or overall survival. Five-year primary patency among claudicants and critical leg ischemia patients was 65% and 68%, respectively.\nThe incidence of iliac PTA/stent placement in conjunction with FFB has increased significantly over time in contemporary practice. Reliance on iliac stent placement for FFB inflow is paradoxically associated with both diminished primary and assisted primary graft patency when compared with historical controls. These findings highlight the importance of patient selection and inflow consideration when performing FFB.",

    "abstract": "A significant proportion of patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) have common iliac artery aneurysms (CIAA). Aneurysmal involvement at the iliac bifurcation potentially undermines long-term durability.\nPatients with CIAA who underwent EVAR were identified in two teaching hospitals. Bell-bottom technique (BBT; iliac limb \u226520 mm) or internal iliac artery embolization and limb extension to the external iliac artery (IIE + EE) were used. Outcome between these two approaches was compared.\nWe identified 185 patients. Indication for EVAR included asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 157, symptomatic or ruptured aneurysm in 19, and CIAA in nine. Mean AAA diameter was 59 mm. Among 260 large CIAAs that were treated, BBT was used to treat 166 CIAA limbs, and 94 limbs underwent IIE + EE. Total reintervention rates were 11% for BBT (n = 19) and 19.1% for IIE + EE (n = 18; P = .149). Rates of reintervention for type Ib or III endoleak were 4% for BBT (n = 7) and 4% for IIE + EE (n = 4; P > .99). The difference in limb patency rates was not significant. The 30-day mortality rate was 1%. Median follow-up was 22 months. Complications did not differ significantly between the two groups; however, the combined incidence of perioperative complications and reinterventions was higher in the IIE + EE group (49% vs 22%; P = .002).\nThe combined incidence of perioperative complications and reinterventions is significantly higher with IIE + EE than with BBT; therefore, when feasible, BBT is desirable.",

Total reintervention rates were 11% for BBT (n = 19) and 19.1% for IIE + EE (n = 18; P = .149). Rates of reintervention for type Ib or III endoleak were 4% for BBT (n = 7) and 4% for IIE + EE (n = 4; P > .99). The difference in limb patency rates was not significant. The 30-day mortality rate was 1%. Median follow-up was 22 months. Complications did not differ significantly between the two groups; however, the combined incidence of perioperative complications and reinterventions was higher in the IIE + EE group (49% vs 22%; P = .002).",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that biologic changes in the vein wall associated with varicose veins (VVs) occur not only in valvular tissue but also in nonvalvular regions. We previously used imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) to determine the distribution of lipid molecules in incompetent valve tissue. In this study, we used IMS to analyze incompetent great saphenous veins (GSVs) in patients with varicose vein (VV) to assess the distribution of lipid molecules.\nWe obtained GSV tissue from 38 VV patients (50 limbs) who underwent GSV stripping. For the control veins (CV), we obtained GSV samples from 10 patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass with reversed GSV grafting for peripheral artery occlusive disease (10 limbs). Conventional and immunofluorescence staining were performed for histopathologic examination. The total lipid content in the homogenized vein tissue was determined. The localization of each lipid molecule in the vein wall was assessed by IMS.\nThe histologic examination showed the VV walls were significantly thicker than the CV walls, and only the VV adventitia was positive for lipid staining. The VV wall had higher concentrations of phospholipids and triglycerides than the CV wall. IMS revealed an abnormal accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC; 1-acyl 16:0) and phosphatidylcholine (diacyl 16:0/20:4) in the VV intima and media. Triglyceride was found only in VV adventitia. The number of lymphatic vessels, as measured by staining with D2-40, a lymphatic vessel-specific marker, was significantly lower in the VV adventitia than in the CV adventitia. Lymphatic vessel reduction may be associated with insufficient lymphatic drainage in the VV adventitia causing histologic changes in VV tissue.\nThe accumulation of LPC (1-acyl 16:0) and PC (diacyl 16:0/20:4) in the VV intima and media may be associated with chronic inflammation, leading to VV tissue degeneration. Furthermore, insufficient lipid drainage by lymphatic vessel may be responsible for accumulation of lipid molecules and subsequent vein wall degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Multiple studies have established that patch angioplasty following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) reduces the risk of subsequent stroke and restenosis compared with primary closure. Previous reports have also demonstrated bovine pericardium to be associated with similar rates of postoperative complications and restenosis compared with other patch materials. Due to favorable handling and sonographic properties, bovine pericardium has become increasingly popular as a patch option in recent years. However, the intermediate- and long-term performance of this material remains incompletely defined. Through a retrospective analysis of our carotid endarterectomy experience, we sought to compare the bleeding, infection, and pseudoaneurysm rates with bovine pericardium patch closure to those with Dacron patch and primary closure. In this study, 1331 primary carotid endarterectomies performed in our institution between 1996 and 2008 were grouped according to the method of arteriotomy closure: primary closure (PC) (216, 16.3%), Dacron patch angioplasty (DPA) (642, 48.2%), and bovine pericardial patch angioplasty (BPA) (457, 34.3%). Demographic variable and postoperative outcome measures collected real-time via a designated database manager were assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis.\nMean follow-up for the entire cohort was 46.1 months. There were no statistically significant differences in rates of postoperative wound infection, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm formation, or 30-day stroke or 30-day mortality among the three groups. Combined 30-day stroke and death was significantly lower in the PC cohort (0.5% vs 2.3% DPA vs 2.4% BPA; P = .94, BPA vs DPA; P = .001, BPA vs PC; P = .001, DPA vs PC), while 5-year restenosis after both DPA (2.0% \u00b1 0.6%) and BPA (1.1% \u00b1 0.6%) was significantly lower compared with PC (5.2% \u00b1 1.6%) (P = .03, DPA vs PC; P = .008, BPA vs PC; P = .14, BPA vs DPA). Five-year survival following BPA (77.9% \u00b1 3.6%) was significantly improved compared with PC (66.9% \u00b1 3.5%) and DPA (60.8% \u00b1 2.1%) in univariate analysis (P = .24, DPA vs PC; P = .01, BPA vs PC; P = .03, BPA vs DPA), with statin use (P = .004) and male gender (P = .05) being positive predictors of enhanced survival on multivariate analysis.\nThis single-institution, retrospective review represents the largest reported experience with BPA after CEA to date and is the only report comparing outcomes after BPA to PC or to DPA. Our experience further demonstrates that patch angioplasty is protective against restenosis after CEA compared with PC. Equivalent rates of perioperative bleeding, infection, and pseudoaneurysm formation were seen with each closure strategy in this study.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of proteins related to cytoskeleton and energetic metabolism at abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) sites using proteomics. Several remodeling-related mechanisms have been associated with AAA formation but less is known about the expression of proteins associated with cytoskeleton and energetic metabolism in AAAs.\nAAA samples (6.73 \u00b1 0.40 cm size) were obtained from 13 patients during elective aneurysm repair. Control abdominal aortic samples were obtained from 12 organ donors. Proteins were analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry.\nThe expression of filamin was increased in the AAA site compared to control abdominal aortic samples while microfibril-associated glycoprotein-4 isotype 1, annexin A5 isotype 1, and annexin A2 were reduced compared with control abdominal aortic samples. Reduction in expression level of energetic metabolism-associated proteins such as triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase was also observed in AAAs compared to controls. Reduction of triosephosphate isomerase expression was also observed by Western blot, which was accompanied by diminished triosephosphate isomerase activity. At the AAA site, pyruvate dehydrogenase expression was reduced and the content of both lactate and pyruvate was increased with respect to controls without changes in lactate dehydrogenase activity.\nThe present results suggest that an anaerobic metabolic state may be favored further to reduce the expression of cytoskeleton-related proteins. The better knowledge of molecular mechanism involved in AAAs may favor development of new clinical strategies.",

Patients introduced solely by VS were identified to minimize confounding of the downstream effect. Outcome measures obtained were revenue, average and total gross margin, relative value unit production, and service utilization.\nA total of 552 cases were identified demonstrating $13 million in revenue. This translated into a gross margin of $5 million. Examined per surgeon, VS was the most profitable, producing $1.6 million. Lower extremity amputation had the highest average gross margin at $34,000. Notably, $8 million in direct cost is among the highest in the health system. A total of 137 cases unique to VS generated $5 million in total revenue. This patient subset made use of up to 29 physician specialty services. General Medicine and Radiology were the most frequently utilized.\nThe overall profitability of a comprehensive vascular program is tremendously positive.

    "abstract": "The evolution and correlation between the aortic neck and distally located iliac necks after endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) was studied.\nOf 179 patients who had undergone AAA repair between 2003 and 2007, 61 received the same radiologic follow-up and were included in this retrospective study. Data for 61 aortic necks and 115 iliac arteries were analyzed using the preoperative scan, 1-month visit, and final follow-up, with a minimum mean follow-up of 24 \u00b1 15.2 months. Three measurements were taken of the aortic neck: subrenal (D1a), 15 mm below the lowest renal artery (D1b), and at the origin of the aneurysm (D1c). Three measurements were taken at the level of the iliac arteries: origin (Da), middle (Db), and the iliac bifurcation (Dc). These measurements were analyzed using analysis of variance and Spearman correlation coefficient. The results were evaluated for subsequent endoleaks, migrations, and reinterventions. All diameters were compared between patients with a regression of >10% in the greatest diameter of AAA at last follow-up (group A, n = 35) and those without (group B, n = 26).\nAll diameters (in mm) increased significantly over time at the level of the proximal neck (D1a = 3.7 \u00b1 2.8, P = .018; D1b = 4.4 \u00b1 2.5, P = .016; D1c = 4.3 \u00b1 3.1, P = .036) and iliac arteries (Da = 2.1 \u00b1 0.2, P = .0006; Db = 2.5 \u00b1 0.5, P = .0006; Dc = 3 \u00b1 0.7, P = .007). The increase in diameters at the proximal neck and iliac arteries evolved independently (insignificant correlation), with the exception of D1b and Dc (P = .006), which showed a weak correlation (r = 0.363). The group A patients presented increases in all diameters, although to a less significant extent (P < .05) than group B patients. During follow-up, a proximal endoleak and a distal endoleak occurred, both requiring reintervention.\nOur results show a trend toward dilatation of the aortic neck and iliac arteries, with no correlation between the two levels, even in patients with a regression of the aneurysm sac during follow-up. Although this study found no correlation with the occurrence of endoleaks, our results suggest the need for a longer follow-up, especially on the landing sites.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the feasibility and efficacy of a new sutureless connector for end-to-end arterial anastomosis.\nThe anastomotic device is a connector consisting of a bare-metal stent with spikes covering its outer surface, which is introduced through the prosthesis. The seal of the anastomosis is obtained by inflating a balloon anchoring the stent with the spikes in the prosthesis and in the receiving artery. This experiment was conducted in three phases: (1) A feasibility study was done on four cadaveric femoral arteries using a polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis, with measurement of the penetration of the spikes into the layers of the arterial wall. (2) Bench tests were conducted in seven automated and in seven sutured anastomoses. Anastomosis sealing was tested using a pump system (\u2264250 mm Hg) in a water-filled closed circuit. (3) The infrarenal aorta of seven pigs was replaced with a 6- to 8-mm diameter prosthesis, using this automated device for the proximal anastomosis. The distal anastomosis was handsewn on the aortic bifurcation. After completion angiography, animals were euthanized for macroscopic and histologic studies of the aorta, connector, and prosthesis. Explantations were done immediately (2 pigs), and at 15 (2 pigs), at 30 (2 pigs), and 42 days (1 pig). Study end points were the automated anastomosis time compared with manual suturing, leakage, mechanical strength, and patency of the anastomosis together with the histologic changes of the aortic wall in contact with the spiked stent.\nTests performed on four cadaveric arteries showed complete penetration of the spikes into the arterial wall layers without metal fracture. Tests of traction showed that the median force needed to rupture the automated anastomosis was 18.3 N (interquartile range [IQR], 17.7-19.9 N), with no significant difference from the handmade anastomosis (19.5 N; IQR, 17.9-20.2 N, P = .33). No leakage was demonstrated in vitro with a pulsatile flow and a pressure up to 250 mm Hg. The median automated anastomosis time on pig aorta was 2.4 minutes (IQR, 1.4-3.3 min) vs 17.0 minutes (IQR, 15.1-17.2 minutes) for the handmade aortic anastomosis performed on the same animals (P = .002). There was no anastomotic leak. Histology showed incorporation of the connector spikes in the aortic wall, without intimal hyperplasia or false aneurysm.\nThis preliminary study confirms the feasibility of this sutureless system, suggesting its usefulness for a faster and simpler anastomosis in hybrid arterial surgery.",

    "abstract": "There are numerous questions about the treatment of blunt aortic injury (BAI), including the management of small intimal tears, what injury characteristics are predictive of death from rupture, and which patients actually need intervention. We used our experience in treating BAI during the past decade to create a classification scheme based on radiographic and clinical data and to provide clear treatment guidelines.\nThe records of patients admitted with BAI from 1999 to 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with a radiographically or operatively confirmed diagnosis (echocardiogram, computed tomography, or angiography) of BAI were included. We created a classification system based on the presence or absence of an aortic external contour abnormality, defined as an alteration in the symmetric, round shape of the aorta: (1) intimal tear (IT)-absence of aortic external contour abnormality and intimal defect and/or thrombus of <10 mm in length or width; (2) large intimal flap (LIF)-absence of aortic external contour abnormality and intimal defect and/or thrombus of \u226510 mm in length or width; (3) pseudoaneurysm-presence of aortic external contour abnormality and contained rupture; (4) rupture-presence of aortic external contour abnormality and free contrast extravasation or hemothorax at thoracotomy.\nWe identified 140 patients with BAI. Most injuries were pseudoaneurysm (71%) at the isthmus (70%), 16.4% had an IT, 5.7% had a LIF, and 6.4% had a rupture. Survival rates by classification were IT, 87%; LIF, 100%; pseudoaneurysm, 76%; and rupture, 11% (one patient). Of the ITs, LIFs, and pseudoaneurysms treated nonoperatively, none worsened, and 65% completely healed. No patient with an IT or LIF died. Most patients with ruptures lost vital signs before presentation or in the emergency department and did not survive. Hypotension before or at hospital presentation and size of the periaortic hematoma at the level of the aortic arch predicted likelihood of death from BAI.\nAs a result of this new classification scheme, no patient without an external aortic contour abnormality died of their BAI. ITs can be managed nonoperatively. BAI patients with rupture will die, and resources could be prioritized elsewhere. Those with LIFs do well, and currently, most at our institution are treated with a stent graft. If a pseudoaneurysm is going to rupture, it does so early. Hematoma at the arch on computed tomography scan and hypotension before or at arrival help to predict which pseudoaneurysms need urgent repair.",

    "abstract": "Juxta-anastomotic stenosis (JAS) is one of the predominant causes of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) failure, with the reported incidence as high as 65%. We hypothesized that technical modification to alter the outflow vein configuration using the novel piggyback Straight Line Onlay Technique (pSLOT) would prevent JAS and improve AVF maturation.\nIntention-to-treat analysis of the outcomes of consecutive distal radiocephalic (RC) fistulas performed by a single operator with three different anastomotic techniques using a prospectively maintained database. Traditional end-to-side technique (ETS), side-to-side straight-line onlay technique (SLOT, STS) and pSLOT in RC AVF created in 125 consecutive patients between 1/2004 and 12/2007 were compared. AVF maturation was evaluated by ultrasonography at 4 to 6 weeks and use for dialysis.\nThe mean age of the study group was 53.1 \u00b1 20.7 years, the male-to-female ratio was 61:64, and the races studied were African American (66; 52.8%) and Caucasian (54; 43.2%). The primary disease for renal failure was hypertension (54; 43.2%) and diabetes (51; 40.8%). Brachial artery flow at maturation was 1103 \u00b1 531 mL/min. Incidence of early JAS was 9.8% and late 14.6%. The clinico-demographic variables between ETS (n = 57), STS (n = 12), and pSLOT (n = 54) were similar. The median follow-up between three groups: ETS (19 months), STS (12 months), and pSLOT (19 months; P = .1), was similar. There was a significant decrease in JAS development in pSLOT patients (P = .04). pSLOT patients also revealed decreased overall fistula failure (ETS 40.3%, STS 33.3%, pSLOT 16.7%; P = .01).\nThere was significant reduction in JAS and improvement in AVF maturation with pSLOT. This study provides evidence highlighting the role of outflow vein configuration in AVF maturation. Minimal alteration of vein wall configuration and avoidance torsion using pSLOT technique improves AVF maturation.",

    "abstract": "Popliteal entrapment syndrome (PES) is a rare but important cause of intermittent claudication in young people. Controversy exists about optimal strategies for diagnosis and management, particularly for variants such as functional popliteal entrapment. The aim of this review was to systematically catalog the published English-language literature on PES and to determine if evidence-based guidelines for management could be formulated.\nAn electronic search using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, AMED, and CINAHL databases was performed to identify articles about PES published from 1947 to December 2010. The systematic review conformed to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement standards. Prospective studies and retrospective case series with more than five patients with arterial, venous, nerve, and combined neurovascular entrapment were analyzed on a study-by-study narrative basis.\nThe search identified 291 articles, and 44 were included. Of these, 30 studies were on popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES). No relationship was found between duration of symptoms and the presence of irreversible arterial injury. Each study used a median of three diagnostic tests (range, 1-6). Arteriography was used in 28 of 30 studies to diagnose PAES, with an estimated mean sensitivity of 97% (range, 85%-100%). Twenty-three studies described arterial reconstructive procedures, with a median failure rate of 27.5% (range, 0%-83%). The proportion of patients asymptomatic after surgery was reported in only 12 of 30 studies, with a median value of 77% (range, 70%-100%).\nA large volume of predominantly retrospective clinical data exists on PES. A subset of studies describe a significant failure rate after surgery, but study quality is insufficient to derive robust conclusions allowing recommendation of any one particular diagnostic modality or operative procedure over another. Improvements in management of this condition are unlikely to result from publication of further retrospective case series, and clinicians should concentrate on prospectively collected data with predefined inclusion criteria, outcome measures, follow-up protocols, and transparent standardized reporting criteria.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine gender differences in atherosclerotic lesion morphology and distribution pattern of patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI).\nIn this prospective cohort study, 233 patients, including 134 men (58%) and 99 women (43%) presenting with critically ischemic limbs were consecutively enrolled. Lesions of the entire lower limb arterial tree were evaluated and grouped into iliac, femoropopliteal, and below-the-knee (BTK) arterial disease. To elucidate whether gender is an independent risk factor for distribution pattern, we performed multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors.\nAt time of diagnosis, women with CLI presented with higher mean age (78 \u00b110 vs 74 \u00b110, P = .01), suffered more often from hypertension (83% vs 71%, P = .04), and fewer were current or former smokers (25% vs 70%, P < .001). After multivariate analysis, women with CLI showed a 2.5-fold higher risk for femoropopliteal lesions (odds ratio [OR], 2.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-6.11, P = .04), with a threefold higher risk for occlusions compared with men (OR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.45-10.0; P = .01). Moreover, in women a higher risk for multilevel disease was observed (OR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.45-10.0; P = .01). In contrast, men presented more often with isolated BTK lesions compared with women (OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05-0.70; P = .03).\nThe finding that female gender may be an independent predictor for pronounced femoropopliteal involvement and more severe and diffuse atherosclerotic disease in CLI may be of particular relevance for early detection and for choosing distinct treatment strategies in women compared with men. Further studies are warranted, especially on confounding risk factors that might be different in men and women and their possible association with lesion morphology in patients with critical limb ischemia.",

DNA samples from 423 AAA patients and 423 controls were genotyped for 12 polymorphisms in 10 genes: MMP1 (-1607G/GG), MMP2 (-735C/T; -1306C/T; -1575 G/A), MMP3 (5A/6A), MMP9 (-1562C/T), MMP10 (A180G), MMP-12 (-82A/G), MMP-13 (-77A/G), TIMP1 (C434T), TIMP3 (-1296T/C), and ELN (G1355A).\nGenotype distribution was significantly different between patients and controls for the following polymorphisms: -1306C/T MMP2; 5A/6A MMP3; -77A/G MMP-13; G1355A ELN; and C434T TIMP1. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, -1306C/T MMP2 (odds ratios [OR] = 0.55 [95% confidence interval, CI .34-.85], P < .007) and G1355A ELN (OR = 0.64 ([95% CI .41-.99], P = .046) polymorphisms resulted in independent protective factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), whereas 5A/6A MMP3 (OR = 1.82 [95% CI 1.04-3.12], P = .034) and -77 A/G MMP-13 (OR = 2.14 [95% CI 1.18-3.86], P = .012) polymorphisms resulted in independent risk factors for AAA. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for traditional cardiovascular factors and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the prevalence of the contemporary presence of three or four genetic risk conditions was a strong and independent determinant of AAA disease (OR = 2.96, 95% CI 1.67-5.24, P < .0001). For those polymorphisms independently associated with AAA in this study (-1306C/T MMP2, 5A/6A MMP3, -77A/G MMP-13, and G1355A ELN polymorphisms), we performed a meta-analysis of the available data (this paper and literature data). We found a significant association with an increased risk of AAA for MMP3 (AAA patients n = 1258, controls n = 1406: OR = 1.48 [95% CI = 1.23-1.78], I(2) = 0%) and MMP-13 (AAA patients n = 800, controls n = 843: OR = 1.37 [95% CI = 1.04-1.82], I(2) = 25%) polymorphisms and a trend that did not reach the statistical significance, toward a decreased risk of AAA for MMP2 (AAA patients n = 1090, controls n = 1077: OR = 0.83 [95% CI = .60-1.15], I(2) =7 1%) and ELN (AAA patients n = 904, controls n = 1069: OR = 0.79 [95% CI = .53-1.18], I(2) = 72%) polymorphisms.\nThese findings suggest that polymorphisms in MMP2, MMP3, MMP-13, and ELN genes may independently contribute to the pathogenesis of AAA.",

    "abstract": "Data derived from prospective randomized clinical trials suggest differential comparative benefit between carotid angioplasty and stent (CAS) placement and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in various age strata. We sought to investigate the impact of age on outcomes of CAS and CEA in general practice.\nWe analyzed the data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), which is representative of all admissions in the United States from 2005 to 2008. The primary end point was occurrence of stroke, cardiac complications, or death during the postprocedural period. Outcomes of interest were compared between patients aged \u226570 years and <70 years, undergoing CEA and CAS. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the effect of age on occurrence of postoperative stroke, cardiac complications, or death. Covariates included in the logistic regression were patient's age, gender, comorbid conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic lung disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and renal failure; symptom status (symptomatic vs asymptomatic status), and hospital characteristics.\nOf the total 495,331 estimated patients who received treatment for CAD during the study period, 88% underwent CEA and the remaining 12% underwent CAS. Of the total procedures, 41% of the procedures were performed in patients aged <70 years compared to the remaining 59% that were performed among patients aged \u226570 years. For patients undergoing CAS, age \u226570 years was an important predictor of postoperative stroke (P = .0025; odds ratio [OR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.5) and cardiac complications postprocedure (P = .045; OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6). For patients undergoing CEA, age \u226570 years was associated with higher cardiac complications (P < .001; OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.7) and higher postoperative mortality risk (P = .0008; OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8) compared to patients aged <70 years. The increased risk of composite end point (postoperative stroke/cardiac complications/mortality) among patients aged \u226570 years was a significant factor for patients undergoing either CAS or CEA (OR of 1.3 for both procedures).\nOur analysis suggests that most CAS and CEAs are performed in patients aged \u226570 years in general practice, and higher rates of postoperative complications are observed among these patients regardless of procedure choice.",

For patients undergoing CEA, age \u226570 years was associated with higher cardiac complications (P < .001; OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.7) and higher postoperative mortality risk (P = .0008; OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8) compared to patients aged <70 years. The increased risk of composite end point (postoperative stroke/cardiac complications/mortality) among patients aged \u226570 years was a significant factor for patients undergoing either CAS or CEA (OR of 1.3 for both procedures).",

    "abstract": "Diabetes is prevalent in most patients undergoing carotid revascularization and is suggested as a marker of poor outcome after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Data on outcome of diabetic patients undergoing carotid artery stenting (CAS) are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate early and 6-year outcomes of diabetic patients undergoing carotid revascularization with CAS and CEA.\nThe database of patients undergoing carotid revascularization for primary carotid stenosis was queried from 2001 to 2009. Diabetic patients were defined as those with established diagnosis and/or receiving oral hypoglycemic or insulin therapy. Multivariate and Kaplan- Meier analyses, stratified by type of treatment, were performed on perioperative (30 days) and late outcomes.\nA total of 2196 procedures, 1116 by CEA and 1080 by CAS (29% female, mean age 71.3 years), were reviewed. Diabetes was prevalent in 630 (28.7%). Diabetic patients were younger (P < .0001) and frequently had hypertension (P = .018) or coronary disease (P = .019). Perioperative stroke/death rate was 2.7% (17/630) in diabetic patients vs 2.3% (36/1566) in nondiabetic, (P = .64); the rate was 3.4% in diabetic CEA group and 2.1% in diabetic CAS group (P = .46). At multivariate analyses, diabetes was a predictor of perioperative stroke/death in the CEA group (odds ratio [OR], 2.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-7.61; P = .04) but not in the CAS group (P = .72). Six-year survival was 76.0% in diabetics and 80.8% in nondiabetics (P = .15). Six-year late stroke estimates were 3.2% in diabetic and 4.6% in nondiabetic patients (P = .90). The 6-year risk of restenosis was similar (4.6% % vs 4.2%) in diabetic and nondiabetic patients (P = .56). Survival, late stroke, and restenosis rates between diabetics and nondiabetics were similar in CAS and CEA groups.\nDiabetic patients are not at greater risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality or late stroke after CAS, however, the perioperative risk can be higher after CEA. This may help in selecting the appropriate technique for carotid revascularization in patients best suited for the type of procedure.",

    "abstract": "Aneurysm growth after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in patients with type II endoleak is associated with adverse outcomes. This study evaluated the long-term success of embolization of type II endoleaks in preventing aneurysm sac growth.\nWe retrospectively reviewed outcomes of patients who underwent infrarenal EVAR who were treated for a type II endoleak between 2000 and 2008. Computed tomography scans were evaluated for aneurysm sac growth or shrinkage from the time of treatment of the endoleak. The embolization material used, graft type, target vessel embolized, and comorbidities were evaluated for their association with sac growth or shrinkage.\nNinety-five patients underwent 140 embolization procedures. The mean time from EVAR to embolization was 26.1 \u00b1 22.2 months, and the average increase in size of the aneurysm sac from EVAR to treatment was 0.7 \u00d7 0.5 cm. Patients underwent an average of 1.6 \u00b1 0.8 embolization procedures after EVAR. Thirteen patients underwent initial simultaneous embolization of two targets. Embolization was with glue (61%), coils (29%), glue and coils (7%), and Gelfoam (3%; Pfizer Inc, New York, NY). No abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) ruptured. Eight patients (8.4%) underwent graft explant and open repair; 19 (20%) required two or more embolization procedures. There was no difference in the target vessel treated or the treatment used in halting sac expansion (>5 mm). Coil embolization alone resulted in more second procedures. The 5-year cumulative survival was 65% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52%-77%), freedom from explant was 89% (95% CI, 81%-97%), freedom from second embolization was 76% (95% CI, 66%-86%), and freedom from sac expansion >5 mm was 44% (95% CI 30%-50%). Univariable analysis identified continued tobacco use (hazard ratio [HR], 2.30; 95% CI, 1.02-5.13; P = .04) was associated with continued sac expansion, and hyperlipidemia (HR, 9.64; 95% CI, 2.22-41.86) was associated with patients requiring a second embolization procedure.\nEmbolization of type II endoleaks is successful early in preventing aneurysm sac growth and rupture after EVAR. However, a significant number of patients require more than one procedure, and at 5 years, many patients who underwent embolization of a type II endoleak continued to experience sac growth. Patients with hyperlipidemia who undergo coil embolization are more likely to require a second embolization procedure, and patients who smoke have a higher likelihood of AAA sac expansion after embolization. Continued long-term surveillance is necessary in this cohort of patients.",

    "abstract": "Open surgical treatment for an infected aortic aneurysm has a high rate of surgical morbidity and mortality and does not guarantee eradication of the infected nidus. The use of endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) might simplify the procedure and provide a good alternative for this critical condition, but this remains to be proved. This study assessed the efficacy and outcome of EVAR with an adjunctive antibiotic treatment strategy.\nWe focused on the experiences and results of the management of infected aortic aneurysms with positive blood cultures. We drew the blood for culture study, immediately prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics, performed EVAR procedures, and followed this with sensitive antibiotics and adjunctive procedures.\nTwelve consecutive patients (mean age, 70 years) were included in this EVAR strategy. Three patients had thoracic, two thoracoabdominal, and the remaining seven had infected abdominal aneurysms. Ten Salmonella, one Staphylococcus, and one Streptococcus spp were identified. There was no hospital death. Three patients underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided drainage, and one underwent open laparotomy debridement. Mean follow-up was 24 months. One late death occurred but was unrelated to reinfection. All patients seemed well, with no evidence of EVAR graft infection at a mean follow-up of 23.6 months.\nThis small multi-institutional study summarizing the experiences of patients with an infected aortic aneurysm managed by EVAR and an aggressive antibiotic strategy revealed that this EVAR strategy might be a suitable approach to treating this disease. These favorable results may be typical for Salmonella infection, which was present in most of the patients. Further experience is needed to assess whether this therapeutic strategy works equally well in aneurysm infection caused by other organisms.",

One late death occurred but was unrelated to reinfection. All patients seemed well, with no evidence of EVAR graft infection at a mean follow-up of 23.6 months.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the association between surgeon practice pattern in shunt placement and 30-day stroke/death in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with contralateral carotid occlusion (CCO).\nAmong 6379 CEAs performed in the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE) between 2002 and 2009, we identified 353 patients who underwent CEA with CCO and compared the 30-day stroke/death rate with 5279 patients who underwent primary, isolated CEA with a patent contralateral carotid artery. Within patients with CCO, we examined the 30-day stroke/death rate across the reason for shunt placement and two distinct surgeon practice patterns in shunt placement: surgeons who selectively used a shunt (\u226495% of CEAs) or routinely used a shunt (>95% of CEAs). We used observed/expected (O/E) ratios to provide risk-adjusted comparisons across groups.\nOf 353 patients with CCO, 118 (33%) underwent CEA without a shunt, 173 (49%) underwent CEA using a shunt placed routinely, and 62 (18%) had a shunt placed for a neurologic indication. Rates of 30-day stroke/death across categories of reason for shunt use were no shunt, 3.4%; routine shunt, 4.0%; and shunt for indication, 4.8% (P = .891). The risk of 30-day stroke/death was higher for surgeons who selectively placed shunts (5.6%) in all their CEAs and lower for surgeons who routinely placed shunts (1.5%, P = .05). The risk of 30-day stroke/death was >1 in patients undergoing selective shunting (O/E ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.7) and <1 for surgeons who placed shunts routinely (O/E ratio, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9). Stroke/death rates were lowest when individual surgeons' intraoperative decisions reflected their usual pattern of practice: 1.5% stroke/death rate when \"routine\" surgeons placed a shunt, 3.4% when \"selective\" surgeons did not place a shunt, and 7.6% stroke/death rate for \"selective\" surgeons who placed a shunt (P = .05 for trend).\nThe risk of 30-day stroke/death is higher in CEA in patients with CCO than with a patent contralateral carotid artery. Surgeons who place shunts selectively during CEA have higher rates of stroke/death in patients with CCO. This suggests that shunt use for CCO during CEA is associated with fewer complications, but only if the surgeon uses a shunt as part of his or her routine practice in CEA. Surgeons should preoperatively consider their own practice pattern in shunt use when faced with a patient who may require shunt placement.",

    "abstract": "Increased utilization of computed tomography angiography (CTA) has increased the radiologic diagnosis of penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers (PAUs), which are defined as the ulceration of atherosclerotic plaque through the internal elastic lamina into the aortic media. However, the presentation, treatment indications, and natural history of this disease process remain unclear.\nThe radiology database at a single university hospital was searched retrospectively for the CTA diagnosis of PAU from January 2003 to June 2009. All scans were interpreted by a cardiovascular radiologist. Information on PAU characteristics and need for surgical repair due to PAU disease was collected. PAU stability or progression was assessed by follow-up CTA, if available. Only PAUs in the aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta were included.\nThree hundred eighty-eight PAUs were diagnosed by CTA interpretation. PAU location was in the aortic arch in 27 (6.8%) cases, the descending thoracic aorta in 243 (61.2%) cases, and the abdominal aorta in 118 (29.7%) cases. Two hundred twenty-four (57.7%) PAUs were isolated (without saccular aneurysm or intramural hematoma); 108 (27.8%) PAUs had associated saccular aneurysms; and 56 (14.4%) PAUs had associated intramural hematoma. Rupture was present in 16 (4.1%) cases. Fifty (12.9%) PAUs underwent repair with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) (n = 30), endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) (n = 10), or open surgery (n = 10); primary indications for repair were saccular aneurysm (n = 26), rupture (n = 16), and persistent or recurrent symptoms (n = 8). Even if initially treated conservatively with resolution of pain, symptomatic PAU disease was more likely to require repair than asymptomatic PAU disease (36.2% vs 7.8%, P < .001). Follow-up CTA was available for 87 PAUs, 20 (23.0%) of which demonstrated radiographic disease progression at a mean follow-up of 8.4 \u00b1 10.3 months. Symptomatic PAU disease was more likely to progress than asymptomatic disease (42.9% vs 16.7%, P = .029).\nFor PAUs diagnosed on CTA at a single institution, 4.1% were ruptured and 12.9% underwent repair. Close follow-up imaging appears to be indicated for PAUs, particularly in the case of symptomatic disease, which is more likely to require repair and to undergo radiographic progression.",

    "abstract": "The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) contains information from discharge abstracts submitted by hundreds of community hospitals across the United States, and it frequently has been used as a resource for population-based research comparing the safety of carotid artery stenting (CAS) to that of carotid endarterectomy (CEA). However, at least two findings from the NIS dataset seem open to question. First, several NIS studies have indicated that more than 90% of CEAs and CAS procedures now are being done in asymptomatic patients, a figure that substantially exceeds the prevalence of asymptomatic patients that has been reported elsewhere. Second, these studies also have suggested that the periprocedural stroke rate for CEA and CAS is lower at community hospitals contributing to the NIS than it was in the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs Stenting Trial (CREST), even though the surgeons and interventionalists participating in CREST were stringently selected according to their previous experience and results. Neither of these two findings seems to pass the test of face validity. Furthermore, some unexpectedly low stroke-to-death (STD) ratios are present in the NIS data, especially for CAS. These issues may be related to poor documentation of preprocedural symptoms and periprocedural strokes in the medical records and to subsequent coding errors in the hospital discharge abstracts on which the NIS is based.",

    "abstract": "The clinical significance of isolated calf vein thrombosis (ICVT) remains controversial. Several studies have shown that the majority of ICVT do not propagate above the knee while other studies have suggested ICVT propagation and recommend full anticoagulation. The purpose of this study was to determine the progression of ICVT, identify risk factors for clot propagation, and to evaluate further thrombotic events associated with it.\nThis study consisted of 156 patients and a total of 180 limbs. All patients included had ICVT involving either the tibial, peroneal, gastrocnemius, or the soleal vein. After initial diagnosis, all patients were started on prophylactic dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin, unless already anticoagulated. All limbs were monitored using duplex ultrasonography scans at intervals of 2 to 3 days, 1 to 3 months, and 6 to 8 months from the initial time of diagnosis. Outcomes examined included lysis of clot, propagation to a proximal vein, and pulmonary emboli.\nICVT was detected in 180 limbs of 156 patients. No significant difference was noted in the gender of the patients or limb preference. Twenty-four patents had both limbs involved. The mean age was 77 years old and the mean follow-up was 5.1 months. The soleal vein was most commonly involved. The second most common vein involved was peroneal, followed by posterior tibial and then gastrocnemius. The least commonly involved vein was the anterior tibial with only one positive result on each side. Fifteen of 180 limbs (9%) had complete resolution of the thrombus within 72 hours. Of these, six were anticoagulated to a therapeutic level. All patients had a follow-up duplex scan within 1 to 3 months' time, and none had recurrence. At the 1 to 3-month follow-up, 11 of 180 patients (7%) had propagation to a proximal vein; all of whom were in a high-risk group to develop a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), either after an orthopedic procedure, stroke, or malignancy. Nine of 156 patients developed a pulmonary emboli also diagnosed within the 1 to 3-months' time period. At the 6 to 8-month follow-up, there was no further propagation of any additional limbs and no further incidences of pulmonary emboli.\nICVT can be safely observed in asymptomatic patients without therapeutic anticoagulation. In our study, patients who have had orthopedic procedures, those with malignancy, and those that were immobile seemed to have a higher incidence of clot propagation. In this group, we recommend full anticoagulation until the patient is ambulatory or the follow-up duplex scan is negative. Our data also suggest that a follow-up duplex scan is not beneficial when performed within 72 hours or after 3 months.",

    "results": "ICVT was detected in 180 limbs of 156 patients. No significant difference was noted in the gender of the patients or limb preference. Twenty-four patents had both limbs involved. The mean age was 77 years old and the mean follow-up was 5.1 months. The soleal vein was most commonly involved. The second most common vein involved was peroneal, followed by posterior tibial and then gastrocnemius. The least commonly involved vein was the anterior tibial with only one positive result on each side. Fifteen of 180 limbs (9%) had complete resolution of the thrombus within 72 hours. Of these, six were anticoagulated to a therapeutic level. All patients had a follow-up duplex scan within 1 to 3 months' time, and none had recurrence. At the 1 to 3-month follow-up, 11 of 180 patients (7%) had propagation to a proximal vein; all of whom were in a high-risk group to develop a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), either after an orthopedic procedure, stroke, or malignancy. Nine of 156 patients developed a pulmonary emboli also diagnosed within the 1 to 3-months' time period. At the 6 to 8-month follow-up, there was no further propagation of any additional limbs and no further incidences of pulmonary emboli.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord ischemia (SCI) remains a significant concern in patients undergoing endovascular repair involving the thoracic aorta (thoracic endovascular aortic repair [TEVAR]). Perioperative lumbar spinal drainage has been widely practiced for open repair, but there is no consensus treatment protocol using lumbar drainage for SCI associated with TEVAR. This study analyzes the efficacy of an institutional protocol using selective lumbar drainage reserved for patients experiencing SCI following TEVAR.\nA prospectively maintained registry was reviewed to identify all patients who underwent TEVAR from January 2000 through June 2010. Preoperative characteristics, intraoperative details, and outcomes, including neurologic deficit and mortality at 30 days and 1 year were determined based on reporting standards. Patients developing symptoms of SCI in the postoperative setting were compared with those without neurologic symptoms. SCI patients who received selective lumbar drainage were grouped based on resolution of neurologic function, with risk factors and outcomes of these subgroups analyzed with \u03c7(2), t test, logistic regression, and analysis of variance (ANOVA).\nTwo hundred seventy-eight TEVARs were performed on 251 patients. Twelve patients accounting for 12 TEVARs were excluded from analysis: 5 patients experienced SCI preoperatively, 4 patients were drained preoperatively, 2 expired intraoperatively, and 1 procedure was aborted. Of the remaining 266 procedures in 239 patients, 16 (6.0%) developed SCI within the 30-day postoperative period. Risk factors for SCI reaching statistical significance included length of aortic coverage (P = .036), existence of infrarenal aortic pathology (P = .026), and history of stroke (P = .043). Stent graft coverage of the left subclavian artery origin was required in 28.9% (n = 77) and was not associated with SCI (P = .52). Ten of 16 post-TEVAR SCI patients received selective postoperative lumbar drains and were categorized based on resolution of symptoms into complete resolution (n = 3; 30%), partial resolution (n = 4; 40%), and no resolution (n = 3; 30%). No patient characteristics or risk factors reached significance in comparison of lumbar drained patients and nondrained patients. All seven drained patients without complete resolution of SCI died within the first year after surgery, while all three of the complete responders survived (P = .017). In patients with SCI, increased all-cause mortality was observed at 1 year (56.3% vs 20.4%; P = .003).\nA protocol utilizing selective postoperative lumbar spinal drainage can be used safely for patients developing SCI after TEVAR with acceptably low permanent neurologic deficit, although overall survival of patients experiencing SCI after TEVAR is diminished relative to non-SCI patients.",

    "abstract": "The corona phlebectatica (CP) is classically described as the presence of abnormally visible cutaneous blood vessels at the ankle with four components: \"venous cups,\" blue and red telangiectases, and capillary \"stasis spots.\" Previous studies showed that the presence of CP is strongly related to the clinical severity of chronic venous disorders (CVD) and the presence of incompetent leg perforators. The aim of this study was to select the most informative components of the CP in the assessment of the clinical severity of CVD patients.\nA multicentric series of 262 unselected patients (524 limbs) consulted for CVD were clinically evaluated using a standardized form to record the CEAP \"C\" items and the presence of the four CP components. Standard categorical and ordinal statistics were used to describe the external validity of the CP components as severity indexes, taking the \"C\" classes as reference.\n\"Stasis spots\" (P < .001; r = .44) and blue telangiectases (P < .01; r = .32) were linearly associated with the ascending order of \"C\" classes, whereas the relationship is less clear for the red telangiectases and the \"venous cups.\" The association pattern of the four components showed that only the blue telangiectases and the \"stasis spots\" were consistent with each other. Blue telangiectases were found more sensitive (0.91 vs 0.75) but less specific (0.52 vs 0.80) than \"stasis spots\" for advanced venous insufficiency (CEAP \"C4-6\").\nThis study shows that only blue telangiectases and \"stasis spots\" provide valuable information in patients with CVD and deserve to be taken into account in the evaluation of such patients.

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a chronic inflammatory condition associated with a prothrombotic, hypofibrinolytic diathesis that may increase the risk of cardiovascular events. The effect of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) on this prothrombotic diathesis is not fully understood, especially over the medium and long term. A better understanding of these postintervention changes may improve the risk of cardiovascular complications in the long term. The purpose of this study was to examine thrombin generation, fibrinolysis, platelet and endothelial activation, and the inflammatory response during the 12 months following EVAR.\nTwenty-nine patients (mean age, 76.9 years) undergoing EVAR for AAA (mean diameter 6.9 cm) had prothrombin fragment (PF) 1 + 2, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity and antigen, soluble P- and E-selectin, and highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) measured before and at 24 hours, and 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery.\nPF1 + 2 were markedly elevated prior to EVAR and remained so at 24 hours and 1 month, but had decreased significantly at 6 and 12 months. TAT was also elevated prior to EVAR and increased still further by 24 hours, but fell to below baseline levels thereafter. PAI activity and t-PA antigen were normal prior to EVAR, increased significantly at 24 hours, and then fell to baseline levels. t-PA activity was only detectable at 1 and 6 months; there was a significant rise in soluble P- and E-selectin after EVAR, which was sustained for 12 months. hsCRP increased transiently in response to EVAR but returned to preoperative levels by 1 month.\nThe prothrombotic, hypofibrinolytic diathesis associated with AAA is normalized 12 months after EVAR. This beneficial systemic effect of EVAR for AAA disease may help protect patients against future thromboembolic cardiovascular events.",

    "abstract": "Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a common cause of secondary lymphedema. Venous lymphedema is sometimes misdiagnosed as primary lymphedema and does not receive optimal treatment. We have routinely used intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging in all cases of limb swelling. The aim of this study is to show that (1) routine use of IVUS can detect venous obstruction missed by traditional venous testing, and (2) iliac-caval venous stenting can yield satisfactory clinical relief and can sometimes reverse abnormal lymphangiographic findings.\nThe study comprised CVD patients who underwent iliac vein stenting. Lymphangiography was abnormal in 72 of 443 CEAP C(3) limbs, with leg swelling as the primary complaint (abnormal lymphangiography group). Clinical features and stent outcome were compared with a control group of 205 of 443 with normal lymphangiography (normal lymphangiographic group).\nClinical features were a poor guide to the diagnosis of lymphedema. Isotope lymphangiography was not helpful in differentiating primary from secondary lymphedema. Venography had 61% sensitivity to the diagnosis of venous obstruction. IVUS had a sensitivity of 88% for significant (\u226550% area stenosis) venous obstruction. At 40 months, cumulative secondary stent patency was similar for the abnormal (100%) and normal lymphangiographic (95%) groups. Swelling improved significantly after stent placement in the abnormal lymphangiographic group (mean [standard deviation] swelling grade improvement 0.8 \u00b1 1.1) but was less (P < .004) than in the control group (1.4 \u00b1 1.3). Complete swelling relief was 16% and 44% (P < .001) and partial improvement (\u22651 grade of swelling) was 45% and 66% (P < .01) in the abnormal and normal lymphangiographic groups, respectively. Associated pain was present in 50% and 36% of the swollen limbs in the abnormal and normal lymphangiographic groups. Pain relief (\u22653 visual analog scale) at 40 months was 87% and 83%, respectively (P = .3), with 65% and 71%, experiencing complete pain relief. Quality of life criteria improved after stent placement in both groups but to a better extent in the normal lymphangiographic group. Abnormal lymphangiography improved or normalized in 9 of 36 (25%) of those tested after stent correction.\nPrevailing practice patterns and diagnostic deficiencies probably result in the misdiagnosis of many cases of venous lymphedema as \"primary\" lymphedema. IVUS is recommended to rule out venous obstruction as the associated or initiating cause of lymphedema. Iliac venous stenting to correct the obstruction has excellent long-term patency and good clinical outcome, although results are not as good as in those with normal lymphatic function.",

Conventional techniques using single, coaxial, and manually steerable sheaths proved too unstable to provide the support required to pass a wire against resistance through the kinked stent. A remotely steerable \"robotic\" catheter provided sufficient precision and stability to cross the kink and reline it with an additional stent, restoring renal perfusion. This technology can help achieve precise and stable introducer sheath position. Further evaluation is necessary to understand the wider applications.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze early and midterm results of endovascular infrainguinal peripheral revascularizations in female patients in our single-center experience, paying particular attention to clinical, anatomic, and technical factors affecting perioperative and follow-up outcomes.\nFrom January 2000 to December 2010, 258 endovascular interventions for femoropopliteal disease were performed. Interventions were retrospectively divided into two groups: interventions performed in women (80 interventions, group 1) and interventions performed in men (178 interventions, group 2). The two groups of patients were compared in terms of demographic data, common risk factors for atherosclerosis, and comorbidities. Early (intraoperative and <30-day) results were analyzed in terms of technical success, conversion to open surgery, primary patency, secondary patency, and, for patients with critical limb ischemia, limb salvage. The follow-up program consisted of clinical and duplex scanning examinations with ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement within the third postoperative month, at 6 and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Follow-up results were analyzed in terms of survival, primary and secondary patency, assisted primary patency, and, for patients with critical ischemia, limb salvage.\nThere were no differences between the two groups in terms of risk factors for atherosclerosis, comorbidities, clinical, and anatomic status. Technical success was 96.9% and technical failure rates were 1.2% in group 1 and 3.9% in group 2 (P = .2). Three in-hospital deaths were recorded, all in group 2, whereas in-hospital thromboses occurred in five patients, two in group 1 and three in group 2; with conversion to surgical bypass in all these cases, and in three of the cases, major amputation was necessary (two in group 1 and one in group 2). Cumulative 30-day mortality was 1.1%, with no difference between women (no deaths) and men (three deaths, 1.6%; P = .4). Overall amputation rate at 30 days was 1.2%, again with no differences between the two groups (2.5% and 0.6%, respectively; P = .4); also, the rate of perioperative thrombosis (overall 2.7%) was similar between the two groups (2.5% and 3.3%, respectively; P = .9). Mean duration of follow-up was 17 months (range, 1-85 months). Estimated 36-month survival rates were 95% in group 1 and 84.5% in group 2 (P = .4; log-rank, 0.7). Cumulative primary patency rates at 36 months were 38% in group 1 and 42% in group 2 (P = .4; log-rank, 0.5). Assisted primary patency at 36 months was 45.1% in group 1 and 60.5% in group 2, whereas secondary patency rates were 63.5% and 76%, respectively (P = .8; log-rank, 0.03).\nEndovascular treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive disease provides similar results between men and women at an intermediate follow-up. There is, however, a trend toward poorer results in women requiring further analysis at a longer follow-up period.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify local differences in inflammation and tissue degradation within the circumference of the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nAAAs have the potential to rupture, and it is unknown why this predominantly occurs at the posterolateral wall. Blood flow dynamics likely influence rupture location but do not explain the whole picture, suggesting that other factors inside the AAA wall have a prominent role.\nAs part of the Aneurysm-Express study, full thickness circular biopsy specimens of AAAs from 25 patients were obtained during surgery according to a standardized protocol. Tissue from the dorsal, ventral, and lateral sides was processed for histology and protein extraction. Levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 and various cytokines were measured.\nLateral AAA sites, when compared with the ventral and dorsal segments, showed more microvessels (median [interquartile range] per mm(2), 91.8 [72.6-124.6] vs 73.9 [63.0-108.0] and 73.6 [52.7-109.5]; P = .013 and P = .005, respectively) and more adventitial inflammation (16.1% [13.5%-24.7%] vs 5.8% [2.8%-18.6%] and 6.3% [4.3%-13.5%]; P = .001 and P < .001, respectively). We observed a higher active MMP-9 (0.139 [0.059-0.339] ng/mL vs 0.060 [0.000-0.157] ng/mL and 0.045 [0.000-0.147] ng/mL; P = .001 and P = .014, respectively) and higher interleukin-8 (28.644 [11.921-62.587] pg/mL vs 16.442 [4.300-34.130] pg/mL and 18.258 [8.273-44.989] pg/mL; P < .001 and P = .010, respectively).\nBiopsy specimens of the ventral AAA wall do not optimally reflect the magnitude of inflammatory processes in the AAA. The lateral sides of the AAA contain more microvessels, more inflammatory cells, more active proteases, and higher cytokine levels. These results suggest that the lateral aortic regions are more rupture-prone and may better reflect the inflammatory status in histopathologic examinations.",

    "abstract": "There are few long-term follow-up studies about the result of revascularization surgery for the treatment of popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES). We performed this retrospective study to analyze the long-term result of revascularization surgery in patients with advanced PAES during the last 16 years.\nTwenty-two limbs in 18 consecutive patients with PAES were treated surgically at Seoul National University Hospital between January 1994 and December 2009. The preoperative diagnosis of PAES was made by duplex ultrasonography, three-dimensional computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, or conventional angiography. The method of surgical approach was determined by the extent of arterial occlusion in preoperative images.\nThe mean age was 31 years old and the majority of patients were men (94%). The chief complaints were claudication in 18 limbs, ischemic rest pain in three limbs, and toe necrosis in one limb. All 22 limbs underwent revascularization for advanced PAES with segmental arterial occlusion. Fourteen limbs underwent musculotendinous section and popliteo-popliteal interposition graft (13 posterior approaches, one medial approach), five femoropopliteal (below-knee) bypasses, one femoro-posterior tibial bypass, and two popliteo-posterior tibial bypasses. All revascularization surgeries were performed with reversed saphenous veins. The overall primary graft patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 80.9%, 74.6%, and 74.6%, respectively. Comparing 5-year graft patency according to the extent of arterial occlusion, patients with occlusion confined to the popliteal artery (n = 14) showed a better patency rate than patients with occlusion extended beyond the popliteal artery (n = 8) with no statistical significance (83.6% vs 53.6%; P = .053). Comparing 5-year graft patency according to the inflow artery, superficial femoral artery inflow (n = 6) showed a worse patency rate than popliteal artery inflow (n = 16) (30.0% vs 85.9%; P = .015).\nIn advanced popliteal entrapment syndrome, longer bypass with superficial femoral artery inflow showed poor long-term graft patency rate. The graft patency rate was excellent in patients whose arterial occlusion was confined to the popliteal artery and treated by popliteal interposition graft with reversed saphenous vein. With these data, we suggest that longer bypass extending beyond the popliteal artery might only be indicated in patients with critical limb ischemia when the extent of disease does not allow short interposition graft.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to define bandage pressures that are safe and effective in treating leg ulcers of mixed arterial-venous etiology.\nIn 25 patients with mixed-etiology leg ulcers who received inelastic bandages applied with pressures from 20 to 30, 31 to 40, and 41 to 50 mm Hg, the following measurements were performed before and after bandage application to ensure patient safety throughout the investigation: laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF) close to the ulcer under the bandage and at the great toe, transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPo(2)) on the dorsum of the foot, and toe pressure. Ejection fraction (EF) of the venous pump was performed to assess efficacy on venous hemodynamics.\nLDF values under the bandages increased by 33% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17-48; P < .01), 28% (95% CI, 12-45; P < .05), and 10% (95% CI, -7 to 28), respectively, under the three pressure ranges applied. At toe level, a significant decrease in flux of -20% (95% CI, -48 to 9; P < .05) was seen when bandage pressure >41 mm Hg. Toe pressure values and TcPo(2) showed a moderate increase, excluding a restriction to arterial perfusion induced by the bandages. Inelastic bandages were highly efficient in improving venous pumping function, increasing the reduced ejection fraction by 72% (95% CI, 50%-95%; P < .001) under pressure of 21 to 30 mm Hg and by 103% (95% CI, 70%-128%; P < .001) at 31 to 40 mm Hg.\nIn patients with mixed ulceration, an ankle-brachial pressure index >0.5 and an absolute ankle pressure of >60 mm Hg, inelastic compression of up to 40 mm Hg does not impede arterial perfusion but may lead to a normalization of the highly reduced venous pumping function. Such bandages are therefore recommended in combination with walking exercises as the basic conservative management for patients with mixed leg ulcers.",

    "abstract": "Stenosis is the main cause of hemodialysis vascular graft failure and it is primarily caused by neointimal hyperplasia (NH) development at the vein-graft anastomosis. Even though NH development factors are well known, their activation pathway still remains disputed and the real role of the mismatch compliance between the vein and the graft wall has not yet been resolved. The purpose of this experimental study in swine was to verify the possibility of preventing the development of NH at the vein-graft anastomosis using a modified commercially available longitudinal stretch expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) Gore (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) graft (either standard or heparin-bonded) with an added handmade ePTFE radial stretch cuff at one end to reduce the compliance between the graft and the vein wall.\nTwelve ePTFE stretch grafts (6 modified and 6 unmodified) were surgically placed as arterovenous grafts (AVGs) between the carotid artery and the external jugular vein in 6 pigs. In each pig, one modified graft was placed on one side and one corresponding unmodified graft on the other side as a control. In 4 pigs, standard stretch ePTFE Gore grafts were used, and in 2 pigs, heparin-bonded stretch Gore grafts were used; 2 pigs were also treated with antiplatelet drugs. All the implanted grafts had a total length of 8 cm and a diameter of 6 mm. The modified graft was realized by cutting a short segment of the commercially available graft lengthwise which was then sewn crosswise (rotated 90\u00b0) with the same diameter as the original graft and was then added to it. A Doppler ultrasound scan was used for monitoring the graft patency immediately, weekly, and before death. At death (21-28 days after implantation), artery, vein, and graft specimens were collected \"en bloc\" for histopathology.\nThe modified grafts in the antiplatelet-treated animals were able to completely prevent NH development on vein wall (100% in 2 subjects) which was also reduced in antiplatelet untreated animals (66.5%, 96.4%, and 100% in 3 subjects, respectively). The modified standard stretch grafts and similarly modified heparin-bonded stretch grafts obtained the same good results in NH prevention.\nData provide evidence of the efficacy of modified stretch ePTFE grafts with an added radial stretch cuff for the prevention of NH in swine models and support the hypothesis of the pivotal role of mismatch compliance between the graft and the vein wall in NH development.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate and report our treatment policies in the management of nonpulmonary arterial aneurysms in Beh\u00e7et disease and to assess the prognosis in a cohort of 25 patients diagnosed between 1996 and 2007 by formally reassessing their outcome at the present time.\nWe identified 25 patients (24 men/1 woman) with Beh\u00e7et disease with nonpulmonary aneurysms (n = 23) or occlusions (n = 2) between 1996 and 2007. All patients fulfilled the International Study Group Criteria for Beh\u00e7et disease. Aneurysms were demonstrated with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) after first-line ultrasonography. Standard surgical procedures were carried out in 22 patients. One patient with a nonruptured saccular aortic aneurysm and 2 patients with carotid aneurysms were managed only medically. For the patients with aneurysms located in the aortic bifurcation, we preferred aorto-bi-iliac bypasses; for the six extremity aneurysms, we were able to ligate the arteries; and for the other 10 extremity aneurysms we used polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts for bypass procedures. All patients received immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids before the operation and were continued in the postoperative period. All patients were examined between January and December 2010 paying special attention for new and anastomotic aneurysms and graft patency.\nThere was one death and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. The remaining 23 patients (92%) were under follow-up after a mean of 7.4 \u00b1 2.9 years after their operation. Four PTFE grafts (40%) inserted for extremity aneurysms occluded with no disabling consequences. Also, 6 patients who were treated with ligation postoperatively began to complain of mild to moderate claudication. In 2 patients, aneurysms recurred at the anastomotic site, whereas in 3 patients, new aneurysms developed at other sites.\nThe surgical management of large, nonpulmonary arterial disease of Beh\u00e7et disease is currently quite satisfactory. When the false aneurysm is in the infrarenal aorta, aorto-bi-iliac bypass is the preferred surgical intervention. Extremity aneurysms can be treated with synthetic graft insertion. In selected cases, ligation can give satisfactory results; however, postoperative claudication is common. In some patients with small intact saccular aneurysms, surgery may not be necessary. Patients must be prescribed immunosuppressive therapy with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids before and after the surgical intervention in order to avoid Beh\u00e7et disease activation.",

    "abstract": "The angiogenic drive in skeletal muscle ischemia remains poorly understood. Innate inflammatory pathways are activated during tissue injury and repair, suggesting that this highly conserved pathway may be involved in ischemia-induced angiogenesis. We hypothesize that one of the endogenous ligands for innate immune signaling, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), in combination with autophagic responses to hypoxia or nutrient deprivation, plays an important role in angiogenesis.\nHuman dermal microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) were cultured in normoxia or hypoxia (1% oxygen). Immunocytochemical analysis of HMGB1 subcellular localization, evaluation of tube formation, and Western blot analysis of myotubule light-chain 3I (LC3I) conversion to LC3II, as a marker of autophagy, were conducted. 3-Methyladenine (3MA), chloroquine, or rapamycin were administered to inhibit or promote autophagy, respectively. In vivo, a murine hind limb ischemia model was performed. Muscle samples were collected at 4 hours to evaluate for nuclear HMGB1 and at 14 days to examine endothelial density. Perfusion recovery in the hind limbs was calculated by laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI).\nHypoxic ECs exhibited reduced nuclear HMGB1 staining compared with normoxic cells (mean fluorescence intensity, 186.9 \u00b1 17.1 vs 236.0 \u00b1 1.6, P = .01) with a concomitant increase in cytosolic staining. HMGB1 treatment of ECs enhanced tube formation, an angiogenic phenotype of ECs. Neutralization of endogenous HMGB1 markedly impaired tube formation and inhibited LC3II formation. Inhibition of autophagy with 3MA or chloroquine abrogated tube formation, whereas its induction with rapamycin enhanced tubing and promoted HMGB1 translocation. In vivo, ischemic skeletal muscle showed reduced numbers of HMGB1-positive myocyte nuclei compared with nonischemic muscle (34.9% \u00b1 1.9% vs 51.7% \u00b1 2.0%, P < .001). Injection of HMGB1 into ischemic hind limbs increased perfusion recovery by 21% and increased EC density (49.2 \u00b1 4.1 vs 34.2 \u00b1 3.4 ECs/high-powered field, respectively; P = .02) at 14 days compared with control hind limbs.\nNuclear release of HMGB1 and autophagy occur in ECs in response to hypoxia or serum depletion. HMGB1 and autophagy are necessary and likely play an interdependent role in promoting the angiogenic behavior of ECs. In vivo, HMGB1 promotes perfusion recovery and increased EC density after ischemic injury. These findings suggest a possible mechanistic link between autophagy and HMGB1 in EC angiogenic behavior and support the importance of innate immune pathways in angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Several reports have been published of the acceptable patency and limb salvage rates after infrapopliteal interventions for the treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI). However, the optimal angiographic end point of endovascular therapy (EVT) remains unclear. This study assessed the relationship between the appearance of wound blush as an angiographic end point and the limb salvage rate in patients with CLI.\n\"Wound blush\" was defined as contrast opacification of the vessels around the wound in digital subtraction angiograms obtained immediately after EVT through the catheter introduced into the popliteal artery. We analyzed the data of 77 consecutive patients (93 limbs) with ischemic ulcerations, classified as Rutherford category 5 or 6, who underwent EVT without bypass surgery. Patients were divided into two groups depending on whether wound blush was seen in the angiogram obtained immediately after the procedure. The freedom from amputation rate was compared between the two groups.\nThe overall limb salvage rate was 81.7%. The limb salvage rate was significantly higher in the wound blush-positive group than in the wound blush-negative group and remained so for at least 3 years after the EVT (96.4% vs 56.8%, P < .001).\nPresence of wound blush after EVT is associated with higher skin perfusion pressure, both of which are associated with higher rates of limb salvage. Wound blush as an angiographic end point in EVT may be a novel predictor of limb salvage in patients with CLI.",

    "abstract": "Published reports of robotic-assisted aortic surgery involve a combination of laparoscopy for aortic dissection and a robotic system for vascular reconstruction. The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and advantage of a total robotic-assisted aortic dissection and vascular reconstruction vs robotic-assisted aortic procedures for aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nFrom February 2006 to August 2010, 21 patients were selected for robotic-assisted aortic procedures: aortobifemoral bypass in 12, AAA repair in 6, iliac aneurysm repair in 1, and ligation of type II endoleak after endovascular aneurysm repair in 2. Inclusion criteria included AAA >5 cm, iliac aneurysm >3 cm, and AIOD TransAtlantic InterSociety Classification (TASC) C or D lesions. The da Vinci S Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif) was used for the abdominal aortic dissection in all cases and for the aortic anastomosis in three cases.\nThe 21 patients (6 women, 15 men) were an average age of 65.7 years (range, 44-86 years), had a body mass index (BMI) of 27.23 kg/m(2), and 90.4% were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 3 or 4. Robotic dissection of the abdominal aorta was successful in 20 patients (95.2%). One patient required full conversion to open AAA repair due to trocar injury. Of the remaining 20 patients, the average robotic dissection time of the infrarenal aorta was 113.1 minutes, and the average aortic clamp time was 86 minutes. The procedure in 15 patients was performed with a minilaparotomy using an average abdominal incision of 13 cm to implant the Dacron or polytetrafluoroethylene graft. Five patients underwent a total robotic-assisted procedure with robotic aortic reconstruction or ligation of a type II endoleak. The 30-day survival rate was 100%. Median length of stay was 7.5 days. All grafts were patent at a median follow-up of 32.0 months.\nFor aortic procedures completed total robotically without an abdominal incision, the estimated blood loss was significantly less than in robotic-assisted procedures with a minilaparotomy. In these selected patients, robotic-assisted technology may be part of the armamentarium for the vascular surgeon as another less invasive method for the treatment of complicated occlusive disease or aneurysm.",

Robotic dissection of the abdominal aorta was successful in 20 patients (95.2%). One patient required full conversion to open AAA repair due to trocar injury. Of the remaining 20 patients, the average robotic dissection time of the infrarenal aorta was 113.1 minutes, and the average aortic clamp time was 86 minutes. The procedure in 15 patients was performed with a minilaparotomy using an average abdominal incision of 13 cm to implant the Dacron or polytetrafluoroethylene graft. Five patients underwent a total robotic-assisted procedure with robotic aortic reconstruction or ligation of a type II endoleak. The 30-day survival rate was 100%. Median length of stay was 7.5 days. All grafts were patent at a median follow-up of 32.0 months.",

    "abstract": "Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a rare neoplasm originating from various organs. The clinical outcome mostly depends on surgical resectability. The authors report an EHE of the extracranial internal carotid artery developed in a 59-year-old male patient 14 years after the intravascular coil embolization for a carotid aneurysm at the same site. Because the lesion was initially diagnosed as regrowth of the thrombosed aneurysm, decision for radical resection was delayed, and the patient died from rapid tumor progression. Differential diagnosis of atypical vascular mass lesions should include neoplasm, because initial radical resection may be the key to achieve a better prognosis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe the development of the Australasian Vascular Audit that was created to unify audit activities under the umbrella of the Australian and New Zealand Society for Vascular Surgery as a Web-based application.\nConstitutional change in late 2008 deemed participation in this audit compulsory for Society members. The Web-based application was developed and tested during 2009. Data for all open vascular surgery and for all endovascular procedures are collected at two points in the admission episode: at the time of operation and at discharge, and entered into the application. Data are analyzed to produce risk-adjusted outcomes. An algorithm has been developed to deal with outliers according to natural justice and to comply with the requirements of regulatory bodies. The Audit is protected by legislated privilege and is officially endorsed and indemnified by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. Confidentiality of surgeons and patients alike is ensured by a legally protected coding system and computer encryption system. Validation is by a verification process of 5% of members per year who are randomly selected. The application is completely funded by the Society.\nData entry commenced on January 1, 2010. Over 40,000 vascular procedures were entered in the first year. The Audit application allows instantaneous on-line access to individual data and to deidentified group data and specific reports. It also allows real-time instantaneous production of log books for vascular trainees. The Audit has already gained recognition in the Australasian public arena during its first year of operation as an important benchmark of correct professional surgical behavior. Compliance has been extremely high in public hospitals but less so in private hospitals such that only 60% of members received a certificate of complete participation at the end of its first year of operation.\nAn Internet-based compulsory audit of complete surgical practice is possible to create and be maintained by a society of surgeons with a membership of just over 200. The 60% compliance rate for complete data entry has created an immediate constitutional challenge for the Society. Future challenges are to improve total participation to an acceptable level and to ensure accurate data entry via a robust validation system.",

    "abstract": "The postthrombotic syndrome is a debilitating condition occurring in 30% to 50% of patients with lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Following iliofemoral DVT, however, postthrombotic morbidity is especially severe, due to occlusion of the common femoral vein (CFV) and iliac veins. While endoluminal recanalization appears effective in restoring patency to the iliac venous system, infrainguinal obstruction of the CFV remains a problem. The purpose of this study is to report preliminary observations of common femoral endovenectomy and intraoperative endoluminal recanalization of the iliac veins in patients with incapacitating postthrombotic iliofemoral obstruction.\nTen patients underwent common femoral endovenectomy with endoluminal iliocaval recanalization. The Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), a validated tool to assess chronic venous disease, the Villalta scale, a validated tool to quantify postthrombotic syndrome, the clinical classification of CEAP, and the Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study-Quality of Life (VEINES-QOL)/Sym questionnaires were completed preoperatively and readministered postoperatively at 8.8 months (mean).\nFive patients were followed for more than 6 months and form the basis of the long-term analysis. All demonstrated significant improvement in their venous scores postoperatively. The VCSS preoperatively was 17 and fell to 9.8 postoperatively (P = .02). The Villalta scale dropped from 13.6 preoperatively to 6.0 postoperatively (P = .002). The VEINES-QOL/Sym questionnaire, a sensitive marker of patient quality of life and symptom status, was improved (P = .01 and .02, respectively).\nChronic postthrombotic iliofemoral venous obstruction treated with common femoral endovenectomy and endoluminal recanalization improves objective outcome measures of patients with chronic postthrombotic obstruction. By restoring unobstructed venous drainage through the CFV to the vena cava, patients' postthrombotic morbidity is reduced and quality of life is improved.",

    "abstract": "Sclerotherapy has been shown to be an effective and increasingly popular therapeutic strategy for the treatment of varicose veins. However, recent reports of serious side effects, including cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) and transient ischemic attacks (TIA), as well as speech and visual disturbances, have caused serious concern regarding its use. This review evaluated the reported incidences of neurological side effects associated with the use of sclerotherapy.\nA systematic search of the data bases MEDLINE, OVID Embase, and Google Scholar was undertaken by two independent reviewers. Articles reporting neurological side effects in humans following foam and liquid sclerotherapy were included; animal studies, laboratory studies, and review articles were excluded. Additional references were also obtained using the related articles function.\nThe search yielded 1023 articles, of which 41 studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria. A total of 10,819 patients undergoing sclerotherapy were reviewed. There were 12 case reports of CVA with confirmatory brain imaging and nine reports of TIA. There were 97 (0.90%) reports of neurological events overall, including TIA, visual and speech disturbances, and 29 cases of reported migraine (0.27%). Symptoms occurred at times ranging from minutes to several days following sclerotherapy. Eleven patients with TIA or CVA were found to have a right to left cardiac shunt, usually a patent foramen ovale.\nNeurological side effects following sclerotherapy are a rare occurrence; however, CVA associated with the use of sclerotherapy is clearly documented. The pathologic mechanisms resulting in CVA are likely to be different to those leading to migraine and visual disturbances; however, care should be exercised in patient selection, particularly in those with known cardiac defects.",

    "abstract": "Hemosuccus pancreaticus is a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding from the pancreatic duct originating from aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms of peripancreatic arteries. It is a life-threatening cause of gastrointestinal bleeding that should always be considered in patients with prolonged or intermittent obscure gastrointestinal blood loss, or both, especially in patients with pancreatic disorders or prior pancreatic surgery. We demonstrate an endovascular treatment strategy in a patient with a common hepatic pseudoaneurysm and upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding, with preserved flow in the hepatic artery. This treatment consisted of a covered stent placement in the hepatic artery, followed by transcatheter coil embolization of collateral feeding arteries.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the influence of significant aneurysm neck thrombus in clinical and morphologic outcomes after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nThe patient population was derived from a prospective EVAR database from two university institutions in The Netherlands from 2004 to 2008. Patients with significant thrombus in the neck (>2 mm in thickness in at least >25% of circumference) were identified as the thrombus group and were compared with the remaining patients without neck thrombus (no-thrombus group), treated within the same period. The primary end point was clinical success. Secondary end points included technical success and rates of decline in renal function. Detailed morphologic analysis of the aortic neck was serially performed for the thrombus group patients to assess changes in thrombus volume.\nThe study included 389 patients: 43 (39 men; mean age of 72.3 years) met the criteria for the thrombus group; of these, 31 (72%) had significant thrombus in >50% of the aortic neck circumference, and 8 (19%) had circumferential thrombus >2-mm thick. Median follow-up was 3.34 years (interquartile range, 2.67-4.72). The estimated 5-year clinical success rate was 74% for the thrombus group and 62% for the no-thrombus group (P = .23). Endograft migration was more frequent in the thrombus group (P = .02). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed a significant association between migration and use of a device without active fixation (hazard ratio, 4.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-18.23; P = .018) but not with the presence of neck thrombus (P = .063). No differences were found in the rates of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate at 30 days and during follow-up between the thrombus and no-thrombus groups. The thrombus volume in the first 10 mm of aortic neck was progressively reduced over time until it was not measurable in most patients, resulting in complete circular attachment of the endograft to the vessel wall.\nOur findings suggest that the presence of aneurysm neck thrombus has no significant influence on short-term and midterm EVAR results.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated whether higher body mass index (BMI) is associated with more adverse lower extremity muscle characteristics at baseline and more adverse changes in muscle over time among participants with lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nThis was a longitudinal, observational study of 425 men and women with PAD and 261 without PAD. Computed tomography was used to measure calf muscle characteristics at baseline and every 2 years. Knee extension isometric strength, power, and 6-minute walk distance were measured at baseline and annually. Baseline BMI (kg/m(2)) categories were ideal (20-25), overweight (>25-30), and obese (>30). Analyses adjust for age, race, sex, ankle brachial index, comorbidities, and other covariates.\nAt baseline, higher BMI among participants with PAD was associated with greater calf muscle area (ideal BMI: 5181 mm(2); overweight: 5513 mm(2); obese: 5695 mm(2); P = .0009 for trend), higher calf muscle percentage of fat (6.38%, 10.28%, 17.44%, respectively, P < .0001 for trend), lower calf muscle density (P < .0001 for trend), and higher isometric knee extension strength (P = .015 for trend). Among participants with PAD, higher BMI was associated with greater declines in calf muscle area (P = .030 for trend) and greater increases in calf muscle percentage of fat (P = .023 for trend). Among participants without PAD, there were no significant associations of baseline BMI with changes in lower extremity muscle outcomes over time.\nAmong PAD participants, higher BMI is associated with greater calf muscle area at baseline. However, higher BMI is associated with more adverse calf muscle density and calf muscle percentage of fat at baseline and greater declines in calf muscle area over time.",

    "abstract": "Single-segment great saphenous vein (SSGSV) remains the conduit of choice for femoral to below-knee popliteal (F-BK) surgical revascularization. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal conduit in patients with inadequate SSGSV.\nThis was a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained vascular registry. Patients underwent F-BK bypass with alternative vein (AV; arm vein, spliced GSV, or composite vein) or prosthetic conduit (PC).\nFrom January 1995 to June 2010, 83 patients had unusable SSGSV for F-BK popliteal reconstruction. Thirty-three patients had an AV conduit and 50 had PC. The AV group was a lower median age than the PC group (69 vs 75 years). The two groups were otherwise similar in comorbid conditions of diabetes mellitus (57.6% vs 58.0%; P > .99), smoking (15.2% vs 32.0%; P = .12), and hemodialysis (3% vs 12%; P = .23). The groups were similar in baseline characteristics such as limb salvage as indication (93.9% vs 86.0%; P = .31), mean runoff score (5.2 vs 4.6; P = .39), and prior ipsilateral bypass attempts (18.2% vs 18.0%; P > .99). The AV and PC groups were also similar in 30-day mortality (6.1% vs 4.0%; P > .99) and wound infection rates (6.1% vs 6.0%; P > .99). PC patients were more likely to be discharged on Coumadin (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ) than AV patients (62.0% vs 27.3%; P = .002). Seventeen of the 50 PC patients (34%) had a distal anastomotic vein cuff. A log-rank test comparison of 5-year outcomes for the AV and PC groups found no significant difference in primary patency (55.3% \u00b1 9.9% vs 51.9% \u00b1 10.8%; P = .82), assisted primary patency (68.8% \u00b1 9.6% vs 54.0% \u00b1 11.0%; P = .45), secondary patency (68.4% \u00b1 9.6% vs 63.7% \u00b1 10.4% for PC; P = .82), or limb salvage rates (96.2% \u00b1 3.8% vs 81.1% \u00b1 8.1%; P = .19). Multivariable analysis demonstrated no association between conduit type and loss of patency or limb. The factors most predictive of primary patency loss were limb salvage as the indication for surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 4.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-10.9; P = .003) and current hemodialysis (HR, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.08-11.4; P = .037). The most predictive factor of limb loss was current hemodialysis (HR, 7.02; 95% CI, 1.13-43.4; P = .036).\nFor patients with inadequate SSGSV, PCs, with varying degrees of medical and surgical adjuncts, appear comparable to AV sources in graft patency for below-knee popliteal bypass targets. This observation is tempered by the small cohort sample size of this single-institutional analysis. Critical limb ischemia as the operative indication and current hemodialysis predict impaired patency, and hemodialysis is associated with limb loss.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the safety of emergency carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with carotid stenosis and unstable neurological symptoms.\nThis prospective, single-center study involved patients with stroke in evolution (SIE) or fluctuating stroke or crescendo transient ischemic attack (cTIA) related to a carotid stenosis \u2265 50% who underwent emergency surgery. Preoperative workup included National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) neurological assessment on admission, immediately before surgery and at discharge, carotid duplex scan, brain contrast-enhanced head computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). End points were perioperative (30-day) neurological mortality, NIHSS score variation, and hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke recurrence. Patients were evaluated according to clinical presentation (SIE or cTIA), timing of surgery, and presence of brain infarction on neuroimaging.\nBetween January 2005 and December 2009, 48 patients were submitted to emergency surgery. CEAs were performed from 1 to 24 hours from onset of symptoms (mean, 10.16 \u00b1 7.75). Twenty-six patients presented an SIE with a worsening NIHSS score between admission and surgery, and 22 presented \u2265 3 cTIAs with a normal NIHSS score (= 0) immediately before surgery. An ischemic brain lesion was detected in four patients with SIE and eight patients with cTIA. All patients with cTIA presented a persistent NIHSS normal score before and after surgery. Twenty-five patients with SIE presented an NIHSS score improvement after surgery. Mean NIHSS score was 5.30 \u00b1 2.81 before surgery and 0.54 \u00b1 0.77 at discharge in the SIE group (P < .0001). One patient with SIE had a hemorrhagic transformation of an undetected brain ischemic lesion after surgery, with progressive neurological deterioration and death (2%).\nDue to the absence of randomized controlled trials of CEA for neurologically unstable patients, data currently available do not support a policy of emergency CEA in those patients. Our results suggest that a fast protocol, including CT scans and carotid duplex ultrasound scans in neurologically unstable patients, could help identify those that can be safely submitted to emergency CEA.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular stents are accepted therapy for iliac artery stenoses and occlusions. Surgery is the recommended therapy for patients with severe iliac artery disease, including those with the combination of ipsilateral common iliac artery (CIA) and external iliac artery (EIA) stenoses/occlusions. This study compared patient outcomes, including late open conversion rates, for combined ipsilateral CIA and EIA stenting vs CIA or EIA stents alone.\nBetween 1998 and 2010, 588 patients underwent iliac artery stenting at two institutions. Patient comorbidities and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed, and analyses were performed using multivariate regression and Kaplan-Meier methods.\nThere were 436 extremities with CIA stents, 195 with EIA stents, and 157 with CIA and EIA stents. The groups did not differ significantly in demographics, comorbidities, or treatment indications. During follow-up, 183 patients died, 95 underwent an endovascular reintervention, and 48 required late open conversion. For patients in the CIA or EIA stent group, the mean \u00b1 standard error survival was 5.3 \u00b1 0.3 years, secondary endovascular intervention-free survival was 7.4 \u00b1 0.6 years, late open conversion-free survival was 9.8 \u00b1 0.4 years, and amputation-free survival was 7.6 \u00b1 0.4 years. In the CIA and EIA stent group, survival was 6.1 \u00b1 0.6 years, secondary endovascular intervention-free survival was 7.2 \u00b1 0.6 years, late open conversion-free survival was 9.0 \u00b1 1.1 years, and amputation-free survival was 8.4 \u00b1 0.5 years. Survival, reintervention-free survival, late open conversion-free survival, and amputation-free survival were all similar between patient groups (all P > .05). CIA and EIA stenting in combination was not a predictor of death, reintervention, late open conversion, or amputation.\nOutcomes are similar for patients with CIA or EIA stents and for those with combined ipsilateral CIA and EIA stents. Late open conversions for iliac artery stent failure are uncommon and not influenced by the location or extent of prior iliac artery stent placement. Endovascular therapy for aortoiliac disease should be extended to consider selected patients with ipsilateral CIA and EIA stenoses/occlusions.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound scan-guided access allows for direct visualization of the access artery during percutaneous endovascular aortic aneurysm repair. We hypothesized that the use of ultrasound scan guidance allowed us to safely increase the utilization of percutaneous endovascular aortic aneurysm repair to almost all patients and decrease access complications.\nA retrospective chart review of all elective endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs, both abdominal and descending thoracic, from 2005 to 2010 was performed. Patients were identified using International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification Codes and stratified based on access type: percutaneous vs cut-down. We examined the success rate of percutaneous access and the cause of failure. Sheath size was large (18-24 F) or small (12-16 F). Minimum access vessel diameter was also measured. Outcomes were wound complications (infections or clinically significant hematomas that delayed discharge or required transfusion), operative and incision time, length of stay, and discharge disposition. Predictors of percutaneous failure were identified.\nOne hundred sixty-eight patients (296 arteries) had percutaneous access endovascular aneurysm repair (P-EVAR) whereas 131 patients (226 arteries) had femoral cutdown access EVAR. Ultrasound scan-guided access was introduced in 2007. P-EVAR increased from zero cases in 2005 to 92.3% of all elective cases in 2010. The success rate with percutaneous access was 96%. Failures requiring open surgical repair of the artery included seven for hemorrhage and six for flow-limiting stenosis or occlusion of the femoral artery. P-EVAR had fewer wound complications (0.7% vs 7.4%; P = .001), shorter operative time (153.3 vs 201.5 minutes; P < .001), and larger minimal access vessel diameter (6.7 mm vs 6.1 mm; P < .01). Patients with failed percutaneous access had smaller minimal access vessel diameters when compared to successful P-EVAR (4.9 mm vs 6.8 mm; P < .001). More failures occurred in small sheaths than large ones (7.4% vs 1.9%; P = .02). Access vessel diameter <5 mm is predictive of percutaneous failure (16.7% of vessels <5 mm failed vs 2.4% of vessels \u2265 5 mm failed; P < .001; odds ratio, 7.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.58-33.8; P = .01).\nUltrasound scan-guided P-EVAR can be performed in the vast majority of patients with a high success rate, shorter operative times, and fewer wound complications. Access vessel diameters <5 mm are at greater risk for percutaneous failure and should be treated selectively.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality after bariatric surgery. However, the concurrent prophylactic placement of an inferior vena cava filter (CPIVCF) in patients undergoing bariatric operations remains controversial. This study used the Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database (BOLD) to establish associated characters and determine outcomes of CPIVCF for patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GB) and adjustable gastric banding (AB) surgeries.\nWe analyzed BOLD, a database of bariatric surgery patient information. GB and AB operations were categorized into open and laparoscopic approaches. Univariate logistic regressions were used to compare between non-CPIVCF and concurrent CPIVCF groups. Significant variables (P < .05) were subsequently input into multivariate regression models: CPIVCF was retained in each model.\nA total of 322 CPIVCFs (0.33%) were identified from 97,218 GB and AB operations performed between 2007 and 2010 in this retrospective registry study. Significant differences were identified in male gender (21.1% vs 31.4%; P < .001), preoperative body mass index (BMI; 44.5 \u00b1 6.6 vs 45.3 \u00b1 7; P < .001), and African-American race (10.5% vs 18%; P < .001) between non-CPIVCF and CPIVCF groups. The CPIVCF group had more patients with previous nonbariatric surgery (50% vs 43.6%; P = .02), a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE; 21.4% vs 3.1%; P < .001), impairment of functional status (7.8% vs 3.1%; P < .001), lower extremity edema (47.2% vs 27.1%; P < .001), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (7.1% vs 2.1%; P < .001), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (58.1% vs 43.3%; P < .001), and pulmonary hypertension (13% vs 4.1%; P < .001). Patients in the CPIVCF group were more likely to receive GB than gastric banding (77% vs 58.1%; P < .001) and an open surgical approach (21.4% vs 4.8%; P < .001). Operative duration was longer in the CPIVCF group (119 \u00b1 67 vs 89 \u00b1 52 minutes; P < .001). The CPIVCF group also had a longer length of hospital stay (3 \u00b1 2 vs 2 \u00b1 6 days; P = .048), was associated with higher incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT; 0.93% vs 0.12%; P < .001), and had a higher mortality (0.31% vs 0.03%; P = .003) from PE and indeterminate causes. In multivariate analysis, male gender, African-American race, previous nonbariatric surgery, a high BMI, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, history of VTE, lower extremity edema, and pulmonary hypertension were preoperative factors associated with CPIVCF.\nCPIVCF was associated with specific clinical features, increased health care resource utilization, and a higher mortality in patients undergoing bariatric operations. Although selected patient characteristics influence surgeons to perform CPIVCF, this study was unable to establish an outcome benefit for CPIVCF.",

He underwent thrombolysis with subsequent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty after developing acute left lower extremity ischemia. At 12-month follow-up, he was free of claudication symptoms. This case illustrates the need for close surveillance and discusses possible treatment options for patients with this rare complication.",

    "abstract": "Pseudoaneurysm (PSA) formation is a complication of hemodialysis access. Open repair requires PSA resection, interposition graft placement, and insertion of a catheter as a bridge. Endovascular stent graft repair is an alternative that permits immediate use of the access site. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of stent grafts for repair of arteriovenous fistula and arteriovenous graft PSA.\nA retrospective review of medical records from October 2007 to March 2011 revealed 24 patients with a PSA who underwent endovascular repair using a stent graft. Indications for repair included PSA with symptoms (n = 11), PSA with skin erosion (n = 8), PSA with failed hemodialysis (n = 3), and PSA after balloon angioplasty of a stenosis (n = 2). Outcome measures were technical success, 30-day and 180-day patency, secondary interventions, and complications. All the statistical analyses were conducted by using software SAS 9.1 (SAS, SAS Institute, Gary, NC).\nTwenty-seven self-expanding stent grafts (Viabahn, W. L. Gore, n = 25; Fluency, Bard, n = 2) were used to treat hemodialysis access (arteriovenous graft, n = 13; arteriovenous fistula, n = 11) PSA in 24 patients (16 females; mean age, 55.7 years; mean body mass index, 28.4; mean PSA diameter, 19.5 mm). Comorbidities included hypertension (n = 22; 91.7%), diabetes mellitus (n = 8; 33.3%), and coronary artery disease (n = 4; 16.67%). The median time from access creation to repair was 455 days. The technical success rate was 100%. Balloon angioplasty of an outflow stenosis was performed in 56% of stent grafts. The 30- and 180-day patency rate was 100% and 69.2%, respectively. Three secondary interventions were performed for treatment of unrelated stenosis. Treatment failure occurred in five (18.5%) stent grafts due to infection (n = 3) and thrombosis (n = 2). Treatment of PSA with skin erosion was associated with failure due to infection (odds ratio, 5.0; 95% confidence interval, .38, 66.01). The remaining 22 (81.5%) stent grafts remain patent. The mean follow-up time was 268.9 days (median, 97.5).\nEndovascular therapy is an effective and durable treatment option for patients with dialysis access PSAs. This technique permits immediate use of the hemodialysis access site as well as identification and treatment of associated stenosis. It may be considered as an alternative to open repair in patients who are anatomically suitable candidates.",

    "abstract": "To quantify longitudinal changes in intra-arterial septum (IS) motion with two-dimensional (2D) phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (2D pcMRI) in type B aortic dissections (AD) to improve the understanding of AD and its midterm development.\nFrom a database of 42 patients who underwent a dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination at the Acute Aortic Treatment Center of The Methodist DeBakey Heart & Vascular Center, 2D pcMRI image data was available from 10 patients with type B AD for both short-term (mean, 6.6 days; range, 1-10 days; n = 7) and midterm follow-up (mean, 155 days; range, 60-324; n = 5). IS motion was quantified as motion of IS boundary points averaged over the cardiac cycle. Relative change in IS motion was expressed as percent change compared with initial presentation. Maximum IS extension (true lumen [TL] expansion) and contraction (TL compression), IS fraction in phase with aortic flow and correlation of IS motion with aortic flow (IS compliance) were quantified.\nIS motion at initial presentation was 0.68 \u00b1 0.2 mm and was reduced at short-term (0.48 \u00b1 0.3 mm; P = .07) and midterm (0.5 \u00b1 0.2 mm; P = .1) follow-up. Trend in relative change of IS motion was variable during short-term follow-up: reduced in three subjects (-75% \u00b1 6%) and elevated in four subjects (48% \u00b1 23%). During midterm follow-up, relative change in IS motion was reduced in four subjects (28% \u00b1 19%) and slightly elevated in one (6.2%). IS contraction decreased with follow-up while IS extension slightly increased. Fraction of IS moving in phase with aortic flow increased but IS compliance decreased, suggesting increasing IS stiffness.\nReduction of IS motion in AD is seen with short-term and midterm follow-up. Intersubject variability of this trend is high at short-term follow-up but low at midterm follow-up. Detailed analysis of IS motion parameters indicate reduction of IS contraction and IS compliance with time. This has potential implications for endovascular management of type B aortic dissections, as expansion of aortic stent grafts can be limited by a stiff IS.",

    "abstract": "Renal dysfunction following endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality. We studied the use of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) as a non-nephrotoxic contrast agent for EVAR.\nRecorded data from 114 consecutive patients who underwent EVAR with CO(2) as the contrast agent over 44 months were retrospectively analyzed. CO(2) was used exclusively in 72 patients and in an additional 42 patients iodinated contrast (IC) was given (mean, 37 mL). Renal and hypogastric artery localization and completion angiography were done with CO(2) in all patients, including additional arterial embolization in 16 cases. Preoperative National Kidney Foundation glomerular filtration rate (GFR) classification was normal in 16 patients, mildly decreased in 52, moderate to severely decreased in 44, and two patients were on dialysis.\nAll graft deployments were successful with no surgical conversions. CO(2) angiography identified 20 endoleaks (two type 1, 16 type 2, and two type 4) and three unintentionally covered arteries. Additional use of IC in 42 patients did not modify the procedure in any case. When compared with a cohort of patients who underwent EVAR using exclusively IC, the operative time was shorter with CO(2) (177 vs 194 minutes; P = .01); fluoroscopy time was less (21 vs 28 minutes; P = .002), and volume of IC was lower (37 vs 106 mL; P < .001). Postoperatively, there were two deaths, two instances of renal failure requiring dialysis, and no complications related to CO(2) use. Among patients with moderate to severely decreased GFR, those undergoing EVAR with IC had a 12.7% greater decrease in GFR compared with the CO(2) EVAR group (P = .004). At 1, 6, and 12-month follow-up, computed tomography angiography showed well-positioned endografts with the expected patent renal and hypogastric arteries in all patients and no difference in endoleak detection compared with the IC EVAR group. During follow-up, eight transluminal interventions and one open conversion were required, and no aneurysm-related deaths occurred.\nCO(2)-guided EVAR is technically feasible and safe; it eliminates or reduces the need for IC use, may expedite the procedure, and avoids deterioration in renal function in patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency. A prospective trial comparing CO(2) with IC during EVAR is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Video-assisted thoracic sympathectomy provides excellent resolution of palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis but is associated with compensatory hyperhidrosis. Low doses of oxybutynin, an anticholinergic medication that competitively antagonizes the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, can be used to treat palmar hyperhidrosis with fewer side effects.\nThis study evaluated the effectiveness and patient satisfaction of oral oxybutynin at low doses (5 mg twice daily) compared with placebo for treating palmar hyperhidrosis.\nThis was prospective, randomized, and controlled study. From December 2010 to February 2011, 50 consecutive patients with palmar hyperhidrosis were treated with oxybutynin or placebo. Data were collected from 50 patients, but 5 (10.0%) were lost to follow-up. During the first week, patients received 2.5 mg of oxybutynin once daily in the evening. From days 8 to 21, they received 2.5 mg twice daily, and from day 22 to the end of week 6, they received 5 mg twice daily. All patients underwent two evaluations, before and after (6 weeks) the oxybutynin treatment, using a clinical questionnaire and a clinical protocol for quality of life.\nPalmar and axillary hyperhidrosis improved in >70% of the patients, and 47.8% of those presented great improvement. Plantar hyperhidrosis improved in >90% of the patients. Most patients (65.2%) showed improvements in their quality of life. The side effects were minor, with dry mouth being the most frequent (47.8%).\nTreatment of palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis with oxybutynin is a good initial alternative for treatment given that it presents good results and improves quality of life.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of remote neuromonitoring as an adjunct to spinal cord protection during surgical repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.\nFour aortic centers in three European countries participated in this prospective observational study. A similar surgical protocol was used in all centers, including assessment of spinal cord function by means of monitoring motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). MEP information was evaluated at one central neurophysiologic department in Maastricht, The Netherlands. Transfer of MEP data from all operating rooms to Maastricht was arranged by Internet connections. In all patients, the protective and surgical strategies to prevent paraplegia were based on MEPs. The on-site surgeons reacted in real time to the interpretation and feedback of the neurophysiologist.\nBetween March 2009 and May 2011, 130 patients (85 men) were treated by open surgical repair. Extent of aneurysms was equally distributed among the centers. Neuromonitoring was technically stabile and successful in all patients. The transfer of data from the operating room in the different vascular centers was undisturbed and without any technical problems. By maintaining a mean distal aortic pressure of 60 mm Hg, MEPs were undisturbed in 65 patients (50%). In another 65 patients (50%), significant changes in MEPs prompted the surgical teams to initiate additional protective and surgical strategies to restore spinal cord perfusion. These measures were not effective in five patients (3.8%), and acute paraplegia resulted. Delayed paraplegia occurred in 10 patients (7.7%) but improved in three and recovered completely in another three. No false-negative or false-positive MEP recordings were experienced.\nRemote neuromonitoring of spinal cord function during open repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms as a telemedicine technique is feasible and effective. It allows centralization of expertise and saves individual centers from investing in complex technology. The value of monitoring MEPs was confirmed in different aortic centers, resulting in adequate neurologic outcome after extensive aortic surgical procedures.",

    "abstract": "An ideal pharmaceutical treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is to prevent aneurysm formation and development (further dilatation of pre-existing aneurysm). Recent studies have reported that oxidative stress with reactive oxygen species (ROS) is crucial in aneurysm formation. We hypothesized that edaravone, a free-radical scavenger, would attenuate vascular oxidative stress and inhibit AAA formation and development.\nAn AAA model induced with intraluminal elastase and extraluminal calcium chloride was created in 42 rats. Thirty-six rats were divided three groups: a low-dose (group LD; 1 mg/kg/d), high-dose (group HD; 5 mg/kg/d), and control (group C, saline). Edaravone or saline was intraperitoneally injected twice daily, starting 30 minutes before aneurysm preparation. The remaining six rats (group DA) received a delayed edaravone injection (5 mg/kg/d) intraperitoneally, starting 7 days after aneurysm preparation to 28 days. AAA dilatation ratio was calculated. Pathologic examination was performed. ROS expression was semi-quantified by dihydroethidium staining and the oxidative product of DNA induced by ROS, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), by immunohistochemical staining.\nAt day 7, ROS expression and 8-OHdG-positive cells in aneurysm walls were decreased by edaravone treatment (ROS expression: 3.0 \u00b1 0.5 in group LD, 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 in group HD, and 4.8 \u00b1 0.7 in group C; 8-OHdG-positive cells: 106.2 \u00b1 7.8 cells in group LD, 64.5 \u00b1 7.7 cells in group HD, and 136.6 \u00b1 7.4 cells in group C; P < .0001), compared with group C. Edaravone treatment significantly reduced messenger RNA expressions of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in aneurysm walls (MMP-2: 1.1 \u00b1 0.5 in group LD, 0.6 \u00b1 0.1 in group HD, and 2.3 \u00b1 0.4 in group C; P < .001; MMP-9: 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 in group LD, 0.2 \u00b1 0.6 in group HD, and 2.4 \u00b1 0.2 in group C; P < .001). At day 28, aortic walls in groups LD and HD were less dilated, with increased wall thickness and elastin content than those in group C (dilatation ratio: 204.7% \u00b1 16.0% in group C, 156.5% \u00b1 6.6% in group LD, 136.7% \u00b1 2.0% in group HD; P < .0001). Delayed edaravone administration significantly prevented further aneurysm dilatation, with increased elastin content (155.2% \u00b1 2.9% at day 7, 153.1% \u00b1 11.6% at day 28; not significant).\nEdaravone inhibition of ROS can prevent aneurysm formation and expansion in the rat AAA model. Free-radical scavenger edaravone might be an effective pharmaceutical agent for AAA in clinical practice.",

MetSyn is found in \u223c50% of patients with peripheral vascular disease. However, its impact on peripheral interventions is unknown. The aim of this study is to determine the outcomes of superficial femoral artery (SFA) interventions in patients with and without MetSyn.\nA database of patients undergoing endovascular treatment of SFA disease between 1999 and 2009 was retrospectively queried. MetSyn was defined as the presence of \u22653 of the following criteria: blood pressure \u2265130 mm Hg/\u226585 mm Hg; triglycerides \u2265150 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein \u226450 mg/dL for women and \u226440 mg/dL for men; fasting blood glucose \u2265110 mg/dL; or body mass index \u226530 kg/m(2). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to assess time-dependent outcomes. Factor analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazard model for time-dependent variables.\nA total of 1018 limbs in 738 patients (64% male, average age 67 years) underwent endovascular treatment for symptomatic SFA disease with 45% of patients meeting the criteria for MetSyn. MetSyn patients were more likely to be female (P = .001), to present with critical ischemia (rest pain/tissue loss: 55% MetSyn vs 45% non-MetSyn; P = .001), have poorer ambulatory status (P = .001), and have more advanced SFA lesions (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus II C/D: 51% vs 11%; P = .001) and worse tibial runoff (P = .001). MetSyn patients required more complex interventions (P = .0001). There was no difference in mortality and major adverse cardiac events, but systemic complications (4% vs 1%; P = .001) and major adverse limb events (12% vs 7%; P = .0009) were significantly higher in the MetSyn group. Immediate postprocedural hemodynamic improvement, resolved or improved symptoms, and restoration of impaired ambulation were equivalent in both groups. Early failure (<6 months) was more common in those with MetSyn. At 5 years, primary, assisted primary, and secondary patencies were not affected by the presence of MetSyn. The presence of MetSyn was associated with a decrease in clinical efficacy, decreased freedom from recurrent symptoms, and decreased freedom from major amputation at 5 years.\nMetSyn is present in nearly half of the patients presenting with SFA disease. These patients present with more advanced disease and have poorer symptomatic and functional outcomes compared with those patients without MetSyn.",

Demographics, presentation, and operative management were reviewed. The mean follow-up was 22 months (range, 1-58 months).\nOver the study period, 16 aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms were identified in 15 patients. Of these, 14 aneurysms (in six men and eight women with mean age of 63 years) underwent surgical repair. The mean aneurysm size was 2.45 cm (range, 0.8-5 cm). One aneurysm (7.1%) was associated with neurologic symptoms, and 13 were asymptomatic. The underlying etiology was trauma in five (35.7%), prior carotid endarterectomy in five (35.7%), and degenerative atherosclerosis in four (28.6%). Aneurysms were isolated to the common carotid artery in six (42.9%), internal carotid artery in five (35.7%), and carotid bifurcation in three (21.4%). Five patients underwent aneurysmectomy with primary repair, seven underwent repair with an interposition graft, one required an innominate to common carotid artery bypass, and one patient had a plication and patch angioplasty. No mortalities or neurologic events were documented within 30 days. One patient had transient cranial nerve palsy. One patient required reintervention at 4 months for stenosis of the bypass graft, and one patient died at 10 months from an unrelated condition. There were no neurologic events on follow-up.\nCarotid artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms are uncommon and usually asymptomatic. Prior trauma and carotid surgery were common etiologies. The location of the aneurysms was equally distributed between the internal and common carotid arteries. Surgical repair was safe and effective with no significant morbidity or mortality and good midterm stroke prevention.",

    "abstract": "To review the indications and results of open surgical and endovascular treatment for ureteral-iliac artery fistula (UIAF).\nWe reviewed the clinical data of 20 consecutive patients treated for 21 UIAFs between 1996 and 2010. Since 2004, iliac artery stent grafts were the primary treatment except for complex fistulas with enteric contamination or abscess. Endpoints were early morbidity and mortality, patient survival, vessel or graft patency, freedom from vascular or stent graft/graft infection, and freedom from recurrent bleeding.\nThere were 20 patients, 15 females, and five males, with mean age of 63 \u00b113 years. Predisposing factors for UIAF were prior tumor resection in 18 patients, radiation in 15, ureteral stents in 15, ileal conduits in four, and ileofemoral grafts in three. All patients presented with hematuria, which was massive in 10. Treatment included iliac stent grafts in 11 patients/12 fistulas (55%), with internal iliac artery (IAA) exclusion in nine, femoral crossover graft with IAA exclusion in five, direct arterial repair in three, and ureteral exclusion with percutaneous nephrostomy and no arterial repair in one. There were no early deaths. Five of eight patients treated by open surgical repair developed complications, which included enterocutaneous fistula in three and superficial wound infection in two. Four patients (36%) treated by iliac stent grafts had complications, including pneumonia, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, buttock claudication, and early stent occlusion in one each. After a median follow-up of 26 months, no one had recurrent massive hematuria, but minor bleeding was reported in three. Patient survival at 5 years was 42% compared with 93% for the general population (P < .001). Freedom from any recurrent bleeding at 3 years was 76%. In the stent graft group, primary and secondary patency rates and freedom from stent graft infection at 3 years were 81%, 92%, and 100%.\nUIAF is a rare complication associated with prior tumor resection, radiation, and indwelling ureteral stents. In select patients without enteric communication or abscess, iliac artery stent grafts are safe and effective treatment, and carry a low risk of recurrent massive hematuria or stent graft infection on early follow-up. Direct surgical repair carries a high risk of enterocutaneous fistula.",

    "abstract": "Explosive blasts are common in the modern military environment. These blasts incorporate a concussive component (primary blast injury) and a penetrating component (secondary blast injury). Penetrating injuries are the leading cause of death and injury in these attacks. This review characterizes the vascular injuries associated with penetrating blast injuries to the neck and provides recommendations on the early management of these casualties for the surgeon unfamiliar with these injuries.\nThe Landstuhl Regional Medical Center Trauma Registry was queried for admissions from January 1, 2006, to June 30, 2010, coded for a penetrating injury to the neck caused by a blast mechanism. Medical records were abstracted from the patient's initial presentation and care through the deployed military medical system. We recorded the vascular injuries, diagnostic studies, operative events, and early postinjury course for all identified patients.\nQuery of the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center Trauma Registry initially identified 252 patients, of which 53 were excluded because their injuries arose from other mechanisms or were only superficial. Among the remaining 199 patients, 38 (19.1%) sustained 44 vascular injuries requiring treatment. Compelling physical examination findings (\"hard signs\") were present in 15 (7.5%), who underwent immediate neck exploration. Another 12 patients also underwent neck exploration without any prior imaging studies. Computed tomography (CT) or CT angiography (CTA) examinations were done in 172 patients without hard-sign physical examination findings. Of these, the result of the imaging study was negative in 106 patients, and no further investigation or treatment for cervical vascular trauma was initiated. Of 66 patients who underwent CT/CTA before operative neck exploration, CT/CTA identified a vascular injury in 26 that was later confirmed on neck exploration. The combination of physical examination and CT/CTA resulted in a sensitivity of 96.3% and a specificity of 97.2% in diagnosing cervical vascular injury.\nPenetrating cervical wounds from war-related blast trauma are associated with potentially life-threatening vascular injuries. The presenting physical examination, availability of CT/CTA, local surgical expertise, and tactical combat situation all contribute to surgical decision making in these patients. In patients without hard signs of vascular trauma and a normal CT/CTA of the neck, there is no evidence to support mandatory surgical neck explorations or further immediate diagnostic studies to exclude cervical vascular injury.",

Follow-up visits were scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and annually thereafter and included a clinical examination and imaging studies. Patients were stratified in three groups according to their smoking status as nonsmokers, former smokers, and smokers.\nThis study analyzed the data for 4176 nonsmokers, 2406 former smokers, and 2056 smokers who were enrolled prospectively in the European Collaborators on Stent-Graft Techniques for Aortic Aneurysm Repair (EUROSTAR) database. Compared with nonsmokers, smokers required more percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placements during EVAR (P < .001), and stent graft migration occurred more often (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.05; P = .033). Nonsmokers had more late type II endoleaks than former smokers and smokers (58.5%, 55.9%, and 35.5%, respectively; P < .001). Smoking had no effect on aneurysm sac behavior or AAA neck growth after EVAR.\nSmokers need more percutaneous transluminal angioplasty procedures and stents during EVAR. They have fewer late type II endoleaks during follow-up; however, smokers should be closely monitored because they have an increased risk of stent graft migration.",

    "abstract": "Women have a lower chance of surviving elective open abdominal aortic repair. The reasons for this are not clear. Endovascular repair has clearly reduced early and midterm morbidity and mortality for patients with large abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). However, most patients are male. It is unclear whether there has been any reduction in elective morbidity for females or what the extent of that reduction has been. We prospectively analyzed outcomes for elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in women at our center and compared results with those for elective open surgery and emergent open and endovascular repair.\nAll patients undergoing elective and emergency AAA from 2002 to 2009 were prospectively entered into a database. Demographic details, including gender, were tabulated. Outcome measures were operative blood loss, incidence of type 1 endoleaks, length of in-hospital stay, postoperative complications, 30-day all-cause mortality, and secondary interventions during the follow-up period. Statistical analysis was performed using Fischer exact test and Student t test. A multivariate analysis was also performed.\nFrom 2002 to 2009, there were 2631 abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) open and endovascular repairs performed in our center (1698 endovascular aneurysm repairs [EVARs], 933 \"open\"). Males comprised 1995 (76%) of patients; females 636 (24%). There were 1592 elective EVARs (1248 male, 344 female) and 106 emergency EVARs (73 male, 33 female). Elective open repair was performed in 788 patients (579 male, 209 female) and emergency open repair in 149 (73 male, 76 female). For women, elective EVAR resulted in significantly greater mortality rates than men (3.2% vs 0.96%, P < .005). There was a greater incidence of intraoperative aortic neck or iliac artery rupture (4.1% vs 1.2% P = .002) and use of Palmaz stents for type 1 endoleaks (16.1% vs 8%, P = .0009). Mean blood loss was greater in females (327 mL vs 275 mL, P = .038). Perioperative complications were also more frequent in women: leg ischemia (3.5% vs 0.6%, P = .003) and colon ischemia requiring colectomy (0.9% vs 0.2%, P = .009). Mean hospital stay was also longer (3.7 days vs 2.2 days, P = .0001). In contrast, there were no gender differences for any of these outcome measures for elective open repair or emergency open surgery or EVAR. There was no significant difference in death rates between EVAR and open repair in women (3.2% vs 5.7%). In males, the 30-day mortality was 0.96% for elective EVAR and 4.7% for elective open surgery. Following logistic regression, female gender remains a significant risk even when the effects of aneurysm size and age are considered (odds ratio 3.4, P < .01).\nMortality for females undergoing elective EVAR is significantly greater than for males. It is also more hazardous. Colon ischemia, native arterial rupture, and type 1 endoleaks are more frequent. Elective endovascular aneurysm repair benefits men more than women.",

    "abstract": "Type II endoleak (T2EL) with aneurysm expansion is believed to place patients at risk for aneurysm-related mortality (ARM). Treatment with glue and/or coil embolization of the aneurysm sac, inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), and lumbar branches via translumbar or transarterial approaches has been utilized to ablate such endoleaks, and thus decrease ARM. We evaluated the midterm results of percutaneous endovascular treatment of T2EL with aneurysm expansion.\nSingle-institution, 5-year (January 2003 to August 2008) retrospective study of all endovascular interventions for T2EL with sac expansion. Blinded, independent review of all available pre- and post-T2EL intervention computed tomography (CT) scans was performed. Aneurysm sac maximal transverse diameters and aneurysm sac growth rates prior to and following T2EL intervention were analyzed.\nForty-two patients (34 male, eight female; mean age, 75) underwent T2EL intervention at 26 \u00b1 20 months after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and were subsequently followed for 23 \u00b1 20 months. Seven out of 42 patients (17%) underwent repeat T2EL intervention. Interventions included 44 translumbar sac embolizations, and transcatheter embolizations of nine IMAs and seven lumbar/hypogastric arteries. Aneurysm diameter was 6.1 \u00b1 1.6 cm at EVAR, 6.6 \u00b1 1.5 cm at initial T2EL treatment, and 6.9 \u00b1 1.7 cm at last follow-up. There were no significant differences in the rates of aneurysm sac growth pre- and post-T2EL treatment. At last follow-up imaging, recurrent or persistent T2EL was noted in 72% of patients. Of 42 patients, nine (21%) received operative endoluminal correction of occult type I or type III endoleaks that were diagnosed during the T2EL angiographic intervention. There were no aneurysm ruptures or ARMs during follow-up; overall mortality for the 5-year study period was 24%.\nIn this series, percutaneous endovascular intervention for type II endoleak with aneurysm sac growth does not appear to alter the rate of aneurysm sac growth, and the majority of patients display persistent/recurrent endoleak. However, diagnostic angiographic evaluation may reveal unexpected type I and III endoleaks and is therefore recommended for all patients with T2EL and sac growth. While coil and glue embolization of aneurysm sac and selected branch vessels does not appear to yield benefit in our series, the diagnosis and subsequent definitive treatment of previously occult type I and III endoleaks may explain the absence of delayed rupture and ARM in our series.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe the incidence, management, and outcomes of mesenteric artery complications (MACs) during angioplasty and stent placement (MAS) for chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI).\nWe retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 156 patients treated with 173 MAS for CMI (1998-2010). MACs were defined as procedure-related mesenteric artery dissection, stent dislodgement, embolization, thrombosis, or perforation. End points were procedure-related morbidity and death.\nThere were 113 women and 43 men (mean age, 73 \u00b1 14 years). Eleven patients (7%) developed 14 MACs, including distal mesenteric embolization in six, branch perforation in three, dissection in two, stent dislodgement in two, and stent thrombosis in one. Five patients required adjunctive endovascular procedures, including in two patients each, catheter-directed thrombolysis or aspiration, retrieval of dislodged stents, and placement of additional stents for dissection. Five patients (45%) required conversion to open repair: two required evacuation of mesenteric hematoma, two required mesenteric revascularization, and one required bowel resection. There were four early deaths (2.5%) due to mesenteric embolization or myocardial infarction in two patients each. Patients with MACs had higher rates of mortality (18% vs 1.5%) and morbidity (64% vs 19%; P <.05) and a longer hospital length of stay (6.3 \u00b1 4.2 vs 1.6 \u00b1 1.2 days) than those without MACs. Periprocedural use of antiplatelet therapy was associated with lower risk of distal embolization or vessel thrombosis (odds ratio, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.90). Patients treated by a large-profile system had a trend toward more MACs (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-26.5; P = .07).\nMACs occurred in 7% of patients who underwent MAS for CMI and resulted in higher mortality, morbidity, and longer hospital length of stay. Use of antiplatelet therapy reduced the risk of distal embolization or vessel thrombosis.

Eleven patients (7%) developed 14 MACs, including distal mesenteric embolization in six, branch perforation in three, dissection in two, stent dislodgement in two, and stent thrombosis in one. Five patients required adjunctive endovascular procedures, including in two patients each, catheter-directed thrombolysis or aspiration, retrieval of dislodged stents, and placement of additional stents for dissection. Five patients (45%) required conversion to open repair: two required evacuation of mesenteric hematoma, two required mesenteric revascularization, and one required bowel resection. There were four early deaths (2.5%) due to mesenteric embolization or myocardial infarction in two patients each. Patients with MACs had higher rates of mortality (18% vs 1.5%) and morbidity (64% vs 19%; P <.05) and a longer hospital length of stay (6.3 \u00b1 4.2 vs 1.6 \u00b1 1.2 days) than those without MACs. Periprocedural use of antiplatelet therapy was associated with lower risk of distal embolization or vessel thrombosis (odds ratio, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.90). Patients treated by a large-profile system had a trend toward more MACs (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-26.5; P = .07).",

    "abstract": "Blunt abdominal aortic injury (BAAI) is a rare injury with less than 200 cases in the current reported world literature, mostly in case report format. We sought to describe the experience of a high-volume trauma center and to provide a contemporary review of the literature to better understand the natural history and management of this injury.\nThis was a retrospective review of patients with BAAI between 1996 and 2010. Data collected included demographics, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, type of intervention, subsequent imaging, and follow-up. BAAI was classified by the presence of external aortic contour abnormality noted as an intimal tear, large intimal flap, pseudoaneurysm, or free rupture. Abdominal aorta zones of injury were classified by possible surgical approaches as zone I (diaphragmatic hiatus to superior mesenteric artery [SMA]), zone II (includes SMA and renal arteries), and zone III (from the inferior aspect of the renal arteries to the aortic bifurcation).\nWe identified 28 individuals (68% male) with BAAI (median age, 28.5; range, 6-61 years). The median injury severity score was 45 (range, 16-75), and 39% were hypotensive at presentation. BAAI presented as intimal tear (21%), large intimal flap (39%), pseudoaneurysm (11%), and free rupture (29%). Zone III was the most common location of injury. Management depended on the location and type of injury: nonoperative (32%), open aortic repair (36%), endovascular repair (21%), and multimodality (10%). Overall mortality was 32%. Most deaths occurred during the initial operative exploration. The mortality rate of free aortic rupture was 100%. Intimal tears resolved or remained stable. Median follow-up was 15.5 months (range, 8 days-7.5 years). Vascular complications due to repair included a thrombosed access femoral artery during an endovascular repair and death of a patient who underwent a hybrid repair.\nThis is the largest BAAI series described in the English literature at one institution. BAAIs range from intimal tears to free rupture, with outcomes and management correlating with type and location of injury. Nonoperative management with blood pressure control using \u03b2-blockers coupled with antiplatelet therapy and close follow-up is successful in individuals with intimal tears with minimal thrombus formation because they remain stable or resolve on follow-up. Free rupture remains a devastating injury, with 100% mortality. For all other categories of aortic injury, successful repair correlates with a favorable prognosis.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the contribution of Aptus EndoStaples (Aptus Endosystems, Sunnyvale, Calif) in the proximal fixation of eight endografts used in the endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR).\nNine human cadaveric aortas were exposed, left in situ, and transected to serve as fixation zones. The Zenith (Cook, Bloomington, Ind), Anaconda (Vascutek, Inchinnan, Scotland, UK), Endurant (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn), Excluder (W. L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz), Aptus (Aptus Endosystems), Aorfix (Lombard Medical, Didcot, UK), Talent (Medtronic), and AneuRx (Medtronic) stent grafts were proximally deployed and caudal displacement force (DF) was applied via a force gauge, recording the DF required to dislocate each device \u226520 mm from the infrarenal neck. Measurements were repeated after four and six EndoStaples were applied at the proximal fixation zone, as well as after a Dacron graft was sutured at the proximal neck in standard fashion. Finally, a silicone tube was used as a control fixation zone to test the DF of grafts with EndoStaples in a material that exceeded the integrity of a typical human cadaveric aorta and provided a consistent substrate to examine the differential effect of variable degrees of EndoStaple implantation using zero, two, four, and six EndoStaples.\nIn the cadaveric model, the mean DF required to dislocate the endografts without the application of EndoStaples was 19.73 \u00b1 12.52 N; this increased to 49.72 \u00b1 12.53 N (P < .0001) when four EndoStaples where applied and to 79.77 \u00b1 28.04 N when six EndoStaples were applied (P = .003). The DF necessary to separate the conventionally hand-sutured Dacron graft from the aorta was 56 N. In the silicone tube model, the Aptus endograft without EndoStaples withstood 3.2 N of DF. The DF increased to 39 \u00b1 3 N when two EndoStaples were added, to 71 \u00b1 6 N when four were added, and to 98 \u00b1 5 N when six were added. In eight of the 13 cadaver experiments conducted with four and six EndoStaples, the displacement occurred as a result of complete aortic transection proximal to the fixation site, indicating that aortic tissue integrity was the limiting factor in these experiments.\nThe fixation of eight different endografts was increased by a mean of 30 N with four Aptus EndoStaples and by a mean of 57 N with six EndoStaples in this model. Endostaples can increase endograft fixation to levels equivalent or superior to that of a hand-sewn anastomosis. The application of six EndoStaples results in aortic tissue failure above the fixation zone, demonstrating fixation strength that exceeds inherent aortic integrity in these cadavers.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective study analyzed the characteristics, potential risks, and therapeutic options of true aneurysms of the donor artery in arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) for dialysis access.\nWe retrospectively collected data of patients with aneurysmal degeneration (AD) after AVF creation from surgeons who were members of the French Society for Vascular Access, treated from January 2006 to May 2011. The study excluded patients with pseudoaneurysms. Patient demographics, type of access, aneurysm characteristics, symptoms, treatment, and follow-up were recorded.\nSeven men and three women (mean age, 38.1 \u00b1 5.3 years) were identified with AD (mean diameter, 44.5; range, 24-80 mm) Mean duration of access was 83.6 \u00b1 48.8 months. Diagnosis of AD was at 117.5 \u00b1 53.8 months after access creation. The initial access was radiocephalic, six; ulnobasilic, one; brachiocephalic, two; and brachiobasilic, one. Three patients had two successive accesses: one brachioaxillary polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft and two proximalizations of a failed radiocephalic AVF. Symptoms were pain and swelling, four; pain related to total thrombosis without signs of ischemia, two; median nerve compression, two; pain related to contained rupture, one; and subacute ischemia due to embolic occlusion of both radial and interosseous arteries, one. AD location was brachial, seven; axillary, one; radial, one; and ulnar, one. Eight patients underwent surgical aneurysm excision associated with interposition bypass using great saphenous vein, two; basilic vein, one; PTFE, three; Dacron, one; and allograft, one. Two patients needed secondary PTFE bypass because of progression of AD to the inflow artery and dilatation of the venous bypass. With a mean follow-up of 20.3 \u00b1 17 months, all bypasses but one remained patent.\nAD is a rare but significant complication of vascular access. Surgical correction should be discussed in most cases due to potential complications. After resection, the choice of reconstructive conduit is not straightforward.",

    "abstract": "Subclavian vein (SCV) compression in venous thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) has been attributed to various anatomic factors, but a potential role for costochondral degeneration in the underlying first rib has not been previously examined. The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency of costochondral calcification (CC), osteophytic degeneration (OD), and occult first rib fractures (FRFx) in patients with venous TOS.\nThirty-seven patients (21 male, 16 female) were referred for surgical treatment of venous TOS during a 12-month period, with a mean age of 30.7 \u00b1 1.8 year (range, 12-55). Thirteen (35%) had acute SCV effort thrombosis and 24 (65%) had chronic symptoms (>14 days). Twenty (54%) had undergone SCV thrombolysis, 11 (30%) had persistent SCV occlusion, and 10 (27%) had concomitant symptoms of neurogenic TOS. All patients underwent paraclavicular thoracic outlet decompression with complete resection of the first rib to the sternum, with 20 (54%) having concomitant SCV reconstruction. The presence or absence of CC, OD, and FRFx was determined by direct visual examination of the rib at operation and following debridement of the excised specimen.\nOne patient had a cervical rib but there were none with radiographic first rib abnormalities. In contrast, FRFx were observed at surgical resection in 16 of 37 patients (43%). All FRFx were small, nondisplaced, linear lesions located within an area of CC in the anterior rib, typically in association with OD and perivenous soft tissue thickening. The mean age of patients with FRFx was higher than those with a normal first rib (38.1 \u00b1 1.5 years vs 25.0 \u00b1 2.3 years; P < .0001), and FRFx were present in 16 of 21 (76%) patients \u2265 30 years of age but in no patients younger than 30 (P < .0001).\nA high proportion (43%) of patients with venous TOS exhibited CC, OD, and a previously undetected FRFx, including 76% of those over the age of 30. These lesions occur in the cartilaginous anterior rib where they are clinically occult and undetected by standard radiographic imaging. We postulate that age-related CC may predispose to OD and stress-induced FRFx, and that inflammation, fibrosis, and anatomic distortion in the surrounding soft tissues may contribute to SCV compression.",

The poor outcome of transfemoral CAS in this age group may be explained by the anatomic characteristics of the aortic trunk and supra-aortic vessels in elderly patients, as well as by a high prevalence of aortic arch atheromatosis. Transcervical CAS with flow reversal for cerebral protection avoids these unfavorable characteristics. This study analyzed the short-term and middle-term results of transcervical CAS with flow reversal in patients aged >70 years at high risk for CEA.\nBetween January 2006 and January 2011, 219 cases of >70% carotid artery stenosis in high-risk patients aged >70 years (55.7% asymptomatic and 44.3% symptomatic) were treated by transcervical CAS. All patients underwent complete neurologic examination by a stroke neurologist before and after the procedure. Primary end points were stroke, death, or myocardial infarction (MI), technical success, and complications at 30 days. During follow-up, we analyzed the rate of restenosis \u226550% and ipsilateral stroke. Data were collected prospectively and outcome was analyzed in all cases, including technical failures.\nThe 30-day combined stroke/death/MI rate was 2.2% (stroke, 1.8%; stroke/death, 2.2%; and MI, 0.45%). In symptomatic patients, stroke/death/MI was 5.1% (stroke, 4.1%; stroke/death, 5.1%). None of the asymptomatic patients suffered stroke, MI, or death postoperatively. Technical success was 96.3% (four inability to cross lesion, two major common carotid dissections, one failed preangioplasty, one stent thrombosis). One cervical hematoma required surgical drainage. At follow-up (18.8 \u00b1 16.9 months), cumulative (standard error) incidence of >70% restenosis was 3% (1%) at 1 year and 8% (3%) at 2 and 3 years. Only one patient experienced ipsilateral stroke during follow-up. Overall survival (standard error) was 94% (2%) at 1 year and 90% (3%) at 2 and 3 years.\nIn our experience, transcervical CAS with flow reversal is a safe technique for treating carotid stenosis in patients aged >70 years. We believe that avoiding the aortic arch and tortuous supra-aortic vessels is responsible for the favorable results in this study.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord ischemia (SCI) is a catastrophic complication of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. This article describes our early experience with a technique for maintaining perfusion of segmental vessels (intercostals and lumbars) in the early postoperative period after endovascular repair of a TAAA, with \"sac perfusion branches\" added to custom-made stent grafts. These are closed 7 to 10 days after the first procedure to complete exclusion of the aneurysm. We have used this technique in 10 patients with type II TAAAs. One developed monoparesis of the right leg during a period of hypotension secondary to a cardiac event and died within 30 days. Two patients developed lower limb weakness after closure of the perfusion branches, both with full recovery. Controlled perfusion of segmental vessels with perfusion branches is feasible and may be a useful adjunct to prevent SCI, providing protection to spinal cord perfusion during the immediate postoperative period when risk of SCI is greatest.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate folding in infrarenal stent grafts in relation to oversizing, barb angle, and barb length using computed tomography images of stent grafts deployed in explanted bovine aortas.\nComputed tomography data from an in vitro investigation on the effect of oversizing of 4% to 45% (n = 19), barb length of 2 to 7 mm (n = 11), and barb angle of 10\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 (n = 7) on device fixation were examined for instances of folding. Folding was classified as circumferential or longitudinal and quantified on an ordinal scale based on codified criteria. Cumulative fold ranking from 0 (no fold) to 6 (two severe folds) for each deployment was used as the measure of folding observed.\nOf the 37 cases, cumulative mean \u00b1 standard deviation fold ranking for stent grafts oversized >30% (n = 5) was significantly greater than the rest (3.4 \u00b1 1.7 vs 0.5 \u00b1 1.2, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test; P < .005). When barb length was varied from 2 to 7 mm (oversizing held at 10%-20%), folding was noted in one of 11 cases. Similarly, when barb angle was varied from 0\u00b0 (vertical) to 90\u00b0 (horizontal), folding was not noted in any of the seven cases.

    "abstract": "Duplex velocity criteria (DVC) to identify in-stent celiac artery (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis is not well defined. Only one study has been published which concluded that DVC for native SMA stenosis overestimated stenosis in stented SMAs. The purpose of this study was to analyze DVC in detecting CA/SMA in-stent stenosis (ISS).\nForty-three patients with 62 stents (32 SMAs and 30 CAs), who had concurrent postoperative duplex ultrasound scan and angiograms for significant ISS by DVC were analyzed. A receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was used to determine optimal DVC (peak systolic velocity [PSV], end-diastolic velocity [EDV], and CA or SMA/aortic systolic ratios) for detecting \u226550% and \u226570% ISS. These were compared to duplex velocities obtained from 97 native CAs and 74 native SMAs with \u226550% stenosis done in the same study period.\nThe mean stented celiac PSV (cm/s), EDV, and systolic ratio for \u226550% ISS were 447, 136, and 7.1 vs 379, 104, and 5.2 for \u226550% native stenosis (P = .067, .106, and < .01). The mean stented SMA PSV, EDV, and ratio for \u226550% ISS were 410, 114, and 6.2 vs 405, 76, and 2.0 for \u226550% native stenosis (P = .885, .037, and < .0001). The PSV cutpoints for detecting \u226550% SMA ISS was 325 cm/s (sensitivity 89%, specificity 100%, and overall accuracy 91%) vs 295 cm/s for \u226550% native SMA and for \u226570% SMA ISS was 412 (sensitivity 100%, specificity 95%, and overall accuracy 97%) vs 400 for native stenosis. The PSV cutpoints for \u226550% CA ISS was 274 cm/s (sensitivity 96%, specificity 86%, and overall accuracy 93%) vs 240 cm/s for \u226550% native stenosis and for \u226570% CA ISS was 363 (sensitivity 88%, specificity 92%, and overall accuracy 90%) vs 320 cm/s for native stenosis (sensitivity 80, specificity 89%, and overall accuracy 85%). ROC analysis also showed that both PSVs and EDVs were equal predictors for SMA and CA \u226550% and \u226570% ISS. For \u226550% SMA ISS, the area under the curve (AUC) for PSV equals 0.91, EDV = 0.81, P = .341. For CA, PSV, AUC = 0.99, EDV = 0.88, P = .063.\nThere is a tendency toward higher velocities in stented CA/SMAs in comparison to native arteries. Caution must be exercised in using duplex velocity cutoffs for native CA/SMA stenosis for stented CA/SMA. Further prospective validation studies are needed.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty \u00b1 stent (PTA/S) and surgical bypass are both accepted treatments for claudication due to superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusive disease. However, long-term results comparing these modalities for primary intervention in patients who have had no prior intervention have not been reported. We report our results with 3-year follow-up.\nWe reviewed all lower extremity bypass procedures at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2001 through 2009 and all PTA/S performed from 2005 through 2009 for claudication. We excluded all limb salvage procedures and included only those that were undergoing their first intervention for claudication due to SFA disease. We recorded patient demographics, comorbidities, perioperative medications, TASC classification, and runoff. Outcomes included complications, restenosis, symptom recurrence, reinterventions, major amputation, and mortality.\nWe identified 113 bypass grafts and 105 PTA/S of femoral-popliteal lesions without prior interventions. Bypasses were above the knee in 62% (45% vein) and below the knee in 38% (100% vein). Mean age was 63 (bypass) versus 69 (PTA/S; P < .01). Mean length of stay (LOS) was 3.9 versus 1.2 days (P < .01). Bypass grafts were used less for TASC A (17% vs 40%; P < .01) and more for TASC C (36% vs 11%; P < .01) and TASC D (13% vs 3%; P < .01) lesions. There were no differences in perioperative (2% vs 0%; not significant [NS]) or 3-year mortality (9% vs 8%; NS). Wound infection was higher with bypass (16% vs 0%; P < .01). None involved grafts. Bypass showed improved freedom from restenosis (73% vs 42% at 3 years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], .23-.71), symptom recurrence (70% and 36% at 3 years; HR, 0.37; 95% CI, .2-.56), and freedom from symptoms at last follow-up (83% vs 49%; HR, 0.18; 95% CI, .08-.40). There was no difference in freedom from reintervention (77% vs 66% at 3 years; NS). Multivariable analysis of all patients showed that restenosis was predicted by PTA/S (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-4.4) and TASC D (HR, 3.7; 95% CI, 3.5-9) lesions. Recurrence of symptoms was similarly predicted by PTA/S (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.8-5) and TASC D lesions (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4-7). Statin use postoperatively was predictive of patency (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, .35-.97) and freedom from recurrent symptoms (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, .36-.93).\nSurgical bypass for the primary treatment of claudication showed improved freedom from restenosis and symptom relief despite treatment of more extensive disease, but was associated with increased LOS and wound infection. Statins improved freedom from restenosis and symptom recurrence overall.",

    "results": "We identified 113 bypass grafts and 105 PTA/S of femoral-popliteal lesions without prior interventions. Bypasses were above the knee in 62% (45% vein) and below the knee in 38% (100% vein). Mean age was 63 (bypass) versus 69 (PTA/S; P < .01). Mean length of stay (LOS) was 3.9 versus 1.2 days (P < .01). Bypass grafts were used less for TASC A (17% vs 40%; P < .01) and more for TASC C (36% vs 11%; P < .01) and TASC D (13% vs 3%; P < .01) lesions. There were no differences in perioperative (2% vs 0%; not significant [NS]) or 3-year mortality (9% vs 8%; NS). Wound infection was higher with bypass (16% vs 0%; P < .01). None involved grafts. Bypass showed improved freedom from restenosis (73% vs 42% at 3 years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], .23-.71), symptom recurrence (70% and 36% at 3 years; HR, 0.37; 95% CI, .2-.56), and freedom from symptoms at last follow-up (83% vs 49%; HR, 0.18; 95% CI, .08-.40). There was no difference in freedom from reintervention (77% vs 66% at 3 years; NS). Multivariable analysis of all patients showed that restenosis was predicted by PTA/S (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-4.4) and TASC D (HR, 3.7; 95% CI, 3.5-9) lesions. Recurrence of symptoms was similarly predicted by PTA/S (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.8-5) and TASC D lesions (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4-7). Statin use postoperatively was predictive of patency (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, .35-.97) and freedom from recurrent symptoms (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, .36-.93).",

Your examination, clinical lab tests, and X-rays do not reveal any serious problems, but he is writhing in pain and begging for relief. Mr Irk has been to a number of different physicians in the interlude including a chiropractor, a pain specialist, several primary care physicians, and a psychiatrist without relief. He has braced up with increasing amounts of analgesics, the latest of which was oral Dilaudid. His last source of pain meds on the street has dried up. You admit him with orders for analgesics. What should your treatment plan be?",

    "abstract": "An inflammatory reaction in vascular tissue is a potential factor linking restenosis after angioplasty. Although cilostazol, a selective phosphodiesterase type 3 inhibitor that is a unique antiplatelet drug and vasodilator, has been reported to be anti-inflammatory, its effect on the inflammatory action of mononuclear cells homing to endothelial cells is not clearly understood. In this study, whether cilostazol inhibits neointimal formation and improves inflammatory actions by inhibiting sialyl Lewis X (SLX) expression on mononuclear cells and E-selectin expression on endothelial cells was evaluated.\nThe effect of cilostazol (1, 3, 10, 30 \u03bcM) on expression of E-selectin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and SLX in rat mononuclear cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide by immunofluorescence and real-time polymerase chain reaction (n = 3) was studied. Additionally, a double-balloon injury model was used on rat carotid arteries to evaluate vascular intimal hyperplasia. 0.1% cilostazol was administered 3 days before the first balloon injury, and the second balloon injury was performed 7 days after the first injury. Cilostazol administration was continued until rats were sacrificed 14 days after the second angioplasty. The expression of SLX on mononuclear cells and E-selectin on endothelial cells by immunofluorescence (n = 10) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (n = 5) were studied.\nCilostazol effectively inhibited the expression of SLX on mononuclear cells and E-selectin on endothelial cells. Cilostazol inhibited the migration of mononuclear cells in neointimal regions and neointimal hyperplasia after balloon injury. The numbers of macrophages and T-lymphocytes and the hyperplasia area in neointimal regions decreased from 71.06 \u00b1 20.04, 1121 \u00b1 244.4 cells per section, 206,400 \u00b1 96,150 mm(2) to 29.65 \u00b1 16.73, 374.2 \u00b1 124.5 cells per section, and 101,900 \u00b1 16,150 mm(2) due to the administration of cilostazol.\nThese results demonstrate that the protective effect of cilostazol against neointimal hyperplasia may be mediated by its anti-inflammatory actions of mononuclear cells homing to endothelial cells by decreasing SLX and E-selectin expression.\nIt is reported that cilostazol inhibits neointimal hyperplasia by decreasing the expression of some cell-adhesion molecules. We evaluated the effects of cilostazol for the expression of sialyl Lewis X (SLX) on mononuclear cells and E-selectin on endothelial cells, which interaction is the first step of inflammation action. Cilostazol was thought to show the anti-inflammatory actions by decreasing SLX and E-selectin expression in addition to decreasing the expression of some cell-adhesion molecules.",

    "abstract": "Several published studies with a small sample size have reported differing results of duplex ultrasound (DUS) utilizing different threshold velocities in detecting significant stenosis of superior mesenteric (SMA) or celiac arteries (CA). The present study is based on the largest number of mesenteric duplex/angiography correlations reported to date for the diagnosis of SMA/CA stenosis.\nOne hundred fifty-three patients (151 SMA and 150 CA) had both DUS and arteriography. Receiver operator curves (ROC) were used to analyze peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), and SMA or CA/aortic PSV ratio in detecting \u226550% and \u226570% stenosis.\nFor SMA (151 arteries: 84 with \u226550% stenosis [54 of which had \u226570% stenosis] based on angiography): the PSV threshold that provided the highest overall accuracy (OA) for detecting \u226550% SMA stenosis was \u2265295 cm/s (sensitivity [sens.] 87%, specificity [spec.] 89%, and OA 88%); and for detecting \u226570% SMA, it was \u2265400 cm/s (sens. 72%, spec. 93%, and OA 85%). The EDV threshold that provided the highest OA for detecting \u226550% stenosis was \u226545 cm/s (sens. 79%, spec. 79%, and OA 79%); and for \u226570% stenosis was \u226570 cm/s (sens. 65%, spec. 95%, and OA 84%). ROC analysis showed that PSV was better than EDV and SMA/aortic PSV ratio for \u226550% stenosis of SMA (P = .003 and P = .0005). For celiac arteries (150 arteries: 105 with \u226550% stenosis [62 of which had \u226570% stenosis]): the PSV threshold that provided the highest OA for \u226550% stenosis was \u2265240 cm/s (sens. 87, spec. 83%, and OA 86%); and for \u226570% stenosis was \u2265320 cm/s (sens. 80%, spec. 89%, and OA 85%). The EDV threshold that provided the highest OA for \u226550% stenosis was \u226540 cm/s (sens. 84%, spec. 48%, and OA 73%); and for \u226570% stenosis was \u2265100 cm/s (sens. 58%, spec. 91%, and OA 77%). ROC analysis showed that PSV was better than EDV and SMA/aortic PSV ratio for \u226550% stenosis of CA (P < .0001 and P = .0410.)\nPSV values can be used in detecting \u226550% and \u226570% SMA/CA stenosis and were better than EDVs and ratios. Previously published data must be validated in individual vascular laboratories. Our results will need prospective validation.",

    "abstract": "The recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommended carotid artery stenting (CAS) as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for symptomatic patients. This and the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST) form the basis for seeking more liberalized indications and reimbursement for CAS. For the years 2005-2007, >130,000 carotid interventions/year were performed, 88.6% of which were CEAs and 11.4% were CAS. For the same years, each CAS procedure had on average $12,000-$13,500 more expensive mean total hospital charges than each CEA. If the percentages of CAS and CEA had been equal (ie, 50% CAS and 50% CEA), this would translate into an additional $2,000,000,000 in charges for these 3 years. It seems unreasonable to approve enhanced reimbursement for CAS at this time, especially since the large incremental costs would go to support CAS procedures that are inferior in most symptomatic patients and possibly unnecessary in most asymptomatic patients.",

    "abstract": "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious, acquired, prothrombotic disorder caused by an antibody response to the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex, which can precipitate arterial as well as venous thromboembolic complications. HIT should be suspected in patients exposed to heparin who present with an unexplained thrombosis or a significant drop in platelet count, or both. Once HIT is suspected or identified, there are specific approaches to its diagnosis and management, with emphasis on removal of all heparin compounds and administration of alternative nonheparin anticoagulants. Generally, HIT is a self-limiting syndrome that resolves when the antibody titers disappear. Patients should be anticoagulated for up to 6 months, depending on the clinical scenario; however, the management of patients with remote or recent HIT requiring a vascular procedure requires special considerations.",

    "abstract": "This prospective multicenter investigation was conducted to define the repeatability of duplex-based identification of venous reflux and the relative effect of key parameters on the reproducibility of the test.\nRepeatability was studied by having the same technologist perform duplicate tests, at the same time of the day, using the same reflux-provoking maneuver and with the patient in the same position. Reproducibility was examined by having two different technologists perform the test at the same time of the day, using the same reflux-provoking maneuver and with the patient in the same position. Facilitated reproducibility was studied by having two different technologists examine the same patients immediately after an educational intervention. Limits of agreement between two duplex scans were studied by changing three elements of the test: time of the day (morning vs afternoon), patient's position (standing vs supine), and reflux initiation (manual vs automatic compression-decompression).\nThe study enrolled 17 healthy volunteers and 57 patients with primary chronic venous disease. Repeatability of reflux time measurements in deep veins did not significantly differ with the time of day, the patient's position, or the reflux-provoking maneuver. Reflux measurements in the superficial veins were more repeatable (P < .05) when performed in the morning with the patient standing. The agreement between the clinical interpretations significantly depended on a selected cut point (Spearman's \u03c1, -0.4; P < .01). Interpretations agreed in 93.4% of the replicated measurements when a 0.5-second cut point was selected. The training intervention improved the frequency of agreement to 94.4% (\u03ba = 0.9). Alternations of the time of the duplex scan, the patient's position, and the reflux-provoking maneuver significantly decreased reliability.\nThis study provides evidence to develop a new standard for duplex ultrasound detection of venous reflux. Reports should include information on the time of the test, the patient's position, and the provoking maneuver used. Adopting a uniform cut point of 0.5 second for pathologic reflux can significantly improve the reliability of reflux detection. Implementation of a standard protocol should elevate the minimal standard for agreement between repeated tests from the current 70% to at least 80% and with more rigid standardization, to 90%.",

Infection of the paravisceral aortic segment precludes an axillofemoral bypass as the sole treatment because of inability to provide visceral perfusion. In situ autograft or allograft reconstructions could be limited by conduit availability or significantly prolonged operative time, or both. Placement of an antibiotic-soaked prosthetic in a field with gross purulence carries a high risk of reinfection.

    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia, the most severe form of peripheral arterial disease, results in extremity amputation if left untreated. Endovascular recanalization of stenotic or occluded infrapopliteal arteries has recently emerged as an effective form of therapy, although the duration of patency is typically limited by restenosis. Recently, it has been suggested that drug-eluting stents originally developed for the coronary arteries might also be effective in preventing restenosis in the infrapopliteal arteries. This prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial tested the hypothesis that treatment of infrapopliteal arterial occlusive lesions with an everolimus-eluting stent (Xience V) would provide superior patency to treatment with a bare-metal stent (Multi-Link Vision).\nA sample size of 140 patients was planned to be enrolled at five European investigative sites. The primary end point was arterial patency at 12 months, defined as the absence of \u226550% restenosis based on quantitative analysis of contrast angiography.\nBetween March of 2008 and September of 2009, 74 patients were treated with Xience V and 66 patients were treated with Vision. After 12 months, the primary patency rate after treatment with Xience V was 85% compared with 54% after treatment with Vision (P = .0001). Treatment with Xience V significantly reduced mean in-stent diameter stenosis (21% \u00b1 21% vs 47% \u00b1 27%; P < .0001) and mean in-stent late lumen loss (0.78 \u00b1 0.63 vs 1.41 \u00b1 0.89 mm; P = .001). There were no differences in the percentage of patients receiving a designation of Rutherford class 0 or 1 at the 12-month follow-up visit (56% for Vision, vs 60% for Xience V; P = .68). Major extremity amputations were rare in both groups (two for Vision and one for Xience V). The use of the Xience V stent significantly reduced the need for repeat intervention: freedom from target lesion revascularization was 91% for Xience V vs 66% for Vision (P = .001).\nTreatment of the infrapopliteal occlusive lesions of critical limb ischemia with everolimus-eluting stents reduces restenosis and the need for reintervention compared with bare metal stents.",

After 12 months, the primary patency rate after treatment with Xience V was 85% compared with 54% after treatment with Vision (P = .0001). Treatment with Xience V significantly reduced mean in-stent diameter stenosis (21% \u00b1 21% vs 47% \u00b1 27%; P < .0001) and mean in-stent late lumen loss (0.78 \u00b1 0.63 vs 1.41 \u00b1 0.89 mm; P = .001). There were no differences in the percentage of patients receiving a designation of Rutherford class 0 or 1 at the 12-month follow-up visit (56% for Vision, vs 60% for Xience V; P = .68). Major extremity amputations were rare in both groups (two for Vision and one for Xience V). The use of the Xience V stent significantly reduced the need for repeat intervention: freedom from target lesion revascularization was 91% for Xience V vs 66% for Vision (P = .001).",

    "abstract": "The goal of the study was to determine the blood pressure (BP) response to renal artery stenting (RAS) for patients with hypertension urgency, hypertension emergency, and angina with congestive heart failure (angina/congestive heart failure [CHF]).\nPatients who underwent RAS for hypertension emergencies (n = 13), hypertension urgencies (n = 25), and angina/CHF (n = 14) were included in the analysis. By convention, hypertension urgency was defined by a sustained systolic BP \u2265 180 mm Hg or diastolic BP \u2265 120 mm Hg, while the definition of hypertension emergency required the same BP parameters plus hypertension-related symptoms prompting hospitalization. Patient-specific response to RAS was defined according to modified American Heart Association reporting guidelines.\nThe study cohort of 52 patients had a median age of 66 years (interquartile range 58-72). The BP response to RAS varied significantly according to the indication for RAS. Hypertension emergency provided the highest BP response rate (85%), while the response rate was significantly lower for hypertension urgency (52%) and angina/CHF (7%; P = .03). Only 1 of 14 patients with angina/CHF was a BP responder. Multivariate analysis showed that hypertension urgency or emergency were not independent predictors of BP response to RAS. Instead, the only independent predictor of a favorable BP response was the number of preoperative antihypertensive medications (odds ratio 7.5; 95% confidence interval 2.5-22.9; P = .0004), which is another indicator of the severity of hypertension. Angina/CHF was an independent predictor of failure to respond to RAS (odds ratio 118.6; 95% confidence interval 2.8-999.9; P = .013).\nHypertension urgency and emergency are clinical manifestations of severe hypertension, but the number of preoperative antihypertensive medications proved to be a better predictor of a favorable BP response to RAS. In contrast, angina/CHF was a predictor of failure to respond to stenting, providing further evidence against the practice of incidental stenting during coronary interventions.",

    "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been shown to improve claudication-limited exercise performance in patients with peripheral artery disease. K-134, a novel phosphodiesterase inhibitor, was evaluated in a phase II trial incorporating an adaptive design to assess its safety, tolerability, and effect on treadmill walking time.\nPatients with peripheral artery disease were randomized to receive placebo (n = 87), K-134 at a dose of 25 mg (n = 42), 50 mg (n = 85), or 100 mg (n = 84), or cilostazol at a dose of 100 mg (n = 89), each twice daily for 26 weeks. Peak walking time (PWT) was assessed using a graded treadmill protocol at baseline and after 14 and 26 weeks of treatment. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board-implemented adaptive design was used that allowed early discontinuation of unsafe or minimally informative K-134 arms.\nAs determined by the prospectively defined adaptive criteria, the 25-mg K-134 arm was discontinued after 42 individuals had been randomized to the arm. During the 26-week treatment period, PWT increased by 23%, 33%, 37%, and 46% in the placebo, 50-mg K-134, 100-mg K-134, and cilostazol arms, respectively (primary analysis placebo vs 100-mg K-134 arm not statistically significant, P = .089). Secondary analyses showed that cilostazol significantly increased PWT after 14 weeks of treatment and that the 100-mg K-134 dose and cilostazol both increased PWT vs placebo after 14 and 26 weeks in those individuals who completed the 26-week trial and were compliant with the study drug, or when the data were analyzed using a mixed-effects model incorporating all time points. K-134 had tolerability and adverse effect profiles similar to that of cilostazol. Both drugs were associated with an increase in withdrawals before study completion due to adverse events compared with placebo.\nK-134 was generally well tolerated. K-134 at a dose of 100 mg twice daily did not affect PWT according to the primary analysis, but K-134 and cilostazol both increased PWT when analyzed using a mixed-effects model and in the per-protocol population.",

    "abstract": "Methods of learning may differ between generations and even the level of training or the training paradigm, or both. To optimize education, it is important to optimize training designs, and the perspective of those being trained can aid in this quest. The Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery leadership sent a survey to all vascular surgical trainees (integrated [0/5], independent current and new graduates [5 + 2]) addressing various aspects of the educational experience. Of 412 surveys sent, 163 (\u223c40%) responded: 46 integrated, 96 fellows, and 21 graduates. The survey was completed by 52% of the integrated residents, 59% of the independent residents, and 20% of the graduates. When choosing a program for training, the integrated residents are most concerned with program atmosphere and the independent residents with total clinical volume. Concerns after training were thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysm procedures and business aspects: 40% to 50% integrated, and 60% fellows/graduates. Integrated trainees found periprocedural discussion the best feedback (79%), with 9% favoring written test review. Surgical training and vascular laboratory and venous training were judged \"just right\" by 87% and \u223c71%, whereas business aspects needed more emphasis (65%-70%). Regarding the 80-hour workweek, 82% felt it prevented fatigue, and 24% thought it was detrimental to patient care. Independent program trainees also found periprocedural discussion the best feedback (71%), with 12% favoring written test review. Surgical training and vascular laboratory/venous training were \"just right\" by 87% and 60% to 70%, respectively, whereas business aspects needed more emphasis (\u223c65%-70%). Regarding the 80-hour workweek, 62% felt it was detrimental to patient care, and 42% felt it prevented fatigue. A supportive environment and adequate clinical volume will attract trainees to a program. For \"an urgent need to know,\" the integrated trainees are especially turning to online texts rather than traditional textbooks, which suggests an opportunity for a shift in educational focus. Point-of-care is the best time for education and feedback, suggesting a continued need for dedicated faculty. The business side of training is underserved and should be addressed.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate short and long-term outcomes of percutaneous transluminal intervention in patients with symptomatic renal artery stenosis due to fibromuscular dysplasia (RAFMD) and/or the combination of RAFMD with aorto-ostial atherosclerotic disease.\nA retrospective analysis of all patients with renal artery RAFMD who underwent transcatheter therapy between January 1999 and December 2009 was performed. Blood pressure (BP) measurement, number of BP medications, and hypertension defined by a systolic BP >140 \u00b1 diastolic BP >90 were recorded. Renal function was defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Restenosis was defined by stenosis >60% and was determined by renal artery duplex and/or angiography. Freedom from event (restenosis, renal failure, or recurrent hypertension) was performed using life table analysis.\nForty-three procedures were performed on 35 patients with RAFMD. Thirty-two patients (91%) were women, with mean age of 61.9 years old. Technical success was 100% with adjunctive stent placement required in the FMD segment for dissection in 1 patient (2.3%) and in the non-FMD aorto-ostial atherosclerotic lesion in 4 patients (9.3%). Short-term outcomes: the majority (69%) had an immediate clinical benefit for hypertension, 6% were cured without BP medications, and 63% improved with less than or equal to preoperative BP medications. Postintervention, 17% remained at moderately reduced renal function (<60), whereas the percent above >60 mL/minute eGFR increased significantly (from 51% to 69%; P = .002). For the entire cohort, renal function (mean eGFR) significantly increased from 71.9 mL/minute + 5.8 to 80.8 mL/minute + 5.2 (P = .007). Long-term outcomes: freedom from recurrent or worsening hypertension (>140 systolic blood pressure [SBP] and >90 diastolic blood pressure [DBP]) was (93%, 75%, and 41%) and freedom from reduced renal function (eGFR <30 mL/minute) was (100%, 95%, and 64%) at 1, 5, and 8 years, respectively. Patients with reduced baseline renal function (<60 mL/minute) and combined atherosclerotic disease were more likely to experience long-term reduced renal function (eGFR <30 mL/minute; P = .003). Primary and assisted primary patency was (95%, 71%, and 50%) and (100%, 100%, and 100%) at 1, 5, and 9 years, respectively.\nRenal angioplasty is a safe and durable modality for treating RAFMD with favorable short and long-term clinical outcomes. Patients with combined atherosclerotic disease and FMD were older and were more likely to have declining renal function over time. Early intervention may be imperative to achieve possible cure of hypertension.",

Technical success was 100% with adjunctive stent placement required in the FMD segment for dissection in 1 patient (2.3%) and in the non-FMD aorto-ostial atherosclerotic lesion in 4 patients (9.3%). Short-term outcomes: the majority (69%) had an immediate clinical benefit for hypertension, 6% were cured without BP medications, and 63% improved with less than or equal to preoperative BP medications. Postintervention, 17% remained at moderately reduced renal function (<60), whereas the percent above >60 mL/minute eGFR increased significantly (from 51% to 69%; P = .002). For the entire cohort, renal function (mean eGFR) significantly increased from 71.9 mL/minute + 5.8 to 80.8 mL/minute + 5.2 (P = .007). Long-term outcomes: freedom from recurrent or worsening hypertension (>140 systolic blood pressure [SBP] and >90 diastolic blood pressure [DBP]) was (93%, 75%, and 41%) and freedom from reduced renal function (eGFR <30 mL/minute) was (100%, 95%, and 64%) at 1, 5, and 8 years, respectively.

    "abstract": "The long-term results of a prospective, randomized controlled trial in patients with primary varicose veins are reported.\nSaphenofemoral ligation (SFL) was done in 73 patients (82 legs). In addition, 43 (23 women; age, 47) underwent stripping and multiple phlebectomies under general anesthesia (group S), and 39 (32 women; age, 49) had concurrent sclerotherapy under local anesthesia (group F). Assessments included CEAP C status, Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), Venous Segmental Disease Score (VSDS), Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), and 36-Item Short-Form (SF-36) scores.\nCEAP C was similar between groups (C(2-6)). In group S, 40% of legs required 25 additional foam sessions (mean volume, 11 mL). In group F, 47.5% of legs required 33 sessions (mean volume, 9 mL) The groups had equivalent preoperative VCSS scores and similar changes at 3 (P = .504) and 5 years (P = .484), as were the absolute VCSS scores at 3 (P = .313) and 5 years (P = .104; Mann-Whitney U). The VSDS score improved (median [interquartile range]) preoperatively vs 3 years (group S, 16.32 [14.7] vs 8.94 [11.51], P = .003; group F, 12.28 [10.37] vs 4.97 [6.19]; P < .0005, Wilcoxon). Above knee obliteration occurred in 17 of 26 (65.4%) for group S and in 16 of 33 (48.5%) for group F at 3 years, and in 14 (53.8%) and 19 (57.6%) at 5 years. AVVQ scores were similar before and at 3 years (P = .703) but significantly favored group S at 5 years (P = .015; Mann-Whitney U). The AVVQ also improved within both groups. The SF-36 mental summary score over 3 years deteriorated in group S (P = .04). However, the physical summary scores did not change between groups (S, P = .361; F, P = .889) or the mental score in group F (P = .285). Changes in the physical (P = .724) and mental (P = .354, Mann-Whitney U) scores did not differ between the groups due to treatment.\nAt 3 and 5 years of follow-up, the treatment was equally effective in the surgical and foam groups, as demonstrated with VCSS, VSDS, and the SF-36 physical component score. At 5 years, the AVVQ was significantly better in the surgical group. The additional foam sessions were also similar. Because traditional surgery for varicose veins does not provide a definitive treatment, foam sclerotherapy could be offered as in a dental care treatment model: \"treat as and when the problem appears.\"",

    "abstract": "Although the benefit of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in reducing the risk of stroke in selected symptomatic and asymptomatic patients has been well documented, the higher incidence of adverse events after CEA for women than for men remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of female gender on perioperative (30-day) and long-term outcomes after eversion CEA (eCEA).\nPatients entered into a prospectively compiled computerized database of all primary consecutive eCEAs performed at our institution from September 1998 to December 2009 were analyzed. Endpoints were perioperative death and stroke, late carotid restenosis or occlusion, and long-term freedom from stroke and survival rates. Long-term follow-up was obtained in 96.8% of patients (97.5% of the women).\nAmong 1294 patients who underwent 1458 eCEAs under general anesthesia with continuous electroencephalographic monitoring and selective shunting, 409 (31.6%) were women (466 eCEAs). More women than men were over 80 years old (P = .001), and female patients were more likely to have arterial hypertension (P = .02) or hyperlipidemia (P = .006) than male patients. Preoperative statin medication (P = .01), contralateral carotid occlusion (P = .02), and shunting use (P = .03) were more frequent among female patients. No perioperative deaths occurred in the series as a whole, while the perioperative stroke risk (0.6% vs 0.5%), and the combined late carotid restenosis and occlusion rate (1.1% vs 0.4%) were comparable between female and male patients. The 7-year stroke-free survival and overall survival rates did not differ significantly between female and male patients (98.3% vs 98.8% and 87.2% vs 93.8%, respectively).\nThis single-center university hospital study shows that although women have a different cardiovascular risk profile from men when they undergo eCEA, there is no evidence of a different gender effect on perioperative and long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Small numbers of patients have advanced renal and mesenteric vascular disease requiring treatment. Open surgical treatment has been considered high risk, and the advent of endovascular intervention has affected management. This study evaluated the safety and long-term efficacy of concomitant mesenteric and renal revascularization with open techniques.\nData from 90 consecutive patients who underwent mesenteric and renal revascularization during a 30-year period were analyzed. Early and late outcomes were evaluated over two intervals: 48 in period A (1978 to 1995), concomitant open renal and mesenteric revascularization (COR; n = 46) and sequential open renal and mesenteric revascularization (SOR; n = 2); 42 in period B (1996 to 2009), 22 COR, 4 SOR, 13 sequential hybrid open/endovascular repairs (SOER), and 3 sequential endovascular repairs (SER).\nThere were 26 men and 64 women (median age, 67 years). Renal insufficiency was present in 24% and coronary artery disease (CAD) in 53%. Open surgical reconstruction was performed in 126 renal and 149 mesenteric arteries, with angioplasty/stenting in 15 and 8, respectively; 58 patients had concomitant aortic reconstruction (AR), and 9 had prior AR (8 in period A, 1 in period B). Hospital mortality was 8.8% overall; seven (14.5%) in period A and one (2.3%) in period B. Causes of early death were hemorrhage in three and multisystem organ failure in five. During a median follow-up of 4.5 years (range, 6 days-26.5 years), 11 patients progressed to hemodialysis (7 COR, 4 SOER), and 6 had recurrent mesenteric ischemia (4 COR, 1 SOER, 1 SER). Eight patients in period A and seven in period B required further procedures (9 renal, 9 mesenteric; 11 COR, 2 SOER, 1 SOR, 1 SER). Univariate analysis of COR patients showed CAD (P = .017) and prior AR (P = .035), but not concomitant AR (P = .366), predicted early death. Five-year survival for COR patients was 65% overall, but 74% in patients who survived the operation, with no difference between time periods (P = .55).\nConcomitant open mesenteric and renal revascularization is associated with low early mortality and good long-term durability in appropriately selected patients. It remains a viable procedure, especially in patients requiring concomitant aortic reconstruction. High-risk patients with CAD or prior aortic surgery should be considered for endovascular treatment, when anatomically feasible.",

The interobserver variability for the four observers showed an overall mean percentage difference of 7.09% \u00b1 6.16% for the von Mises stress and 9.47% \u00b1 8.18% for the PWRR measurement.

    "abstract": "Patients with healed venous ulcers often experience recurrence of ulceration, despite the use of long-term compression therapy. This study examines the effect of closing incompetent superficial and/or perforating veins on ulcer recurrence rates in patients with CEAP 5 who have progressive lipodermatosclerosis and impending ulceration.\nEndovenous ablation was performed on patients with CEAP 5 disease and incompetent superficial and/or perforator veins and increasing lipodermatosclerosis and/or progressive malleolar pain. A minimum of 3 months of compressive therapy was attempted before endovenous ablation of incompetent veins. Demographic data, risk factors, CEAP classification, procedural details, and postoperative status were all recorded. Patients underwent duplex ultrasound scans before ablation to assess for deep, superficial, and perforator venous incompetence as well as postoperatively to confirm successful ablation.\nTwenty-eight endovenous ablation procedures (superficial = 19; perforator = 9) were performed on 20 patients (limbs = 21). The mean patient age was 73 years old (range, 45-93 years) and the mean body mass index was 29.5 (18.9-58.4). Ninety-five percent of patients previously wore compression stockings (20-30 mm Hg = 9; 30-40 mm Hg = 10; none = 1) for a mean time of 23.3 months (range, 3-52 months) since the prior ulcer healed. Indications for venous ablation were increasing malleolar pain (55%) and/or lipodermatosclerosis (70%). Technical success rates for the ablation procedures were 100% for superficial veins and 89% for perforators (96.4% overall). All patients underwent closure of at least one incompetent vein. Postoperatively, 95% of patients were compliant with wearing compression stockings (20-30 mm Hg = 8; 30-40 mm Hg = 11; none = 1). Ulcer recurrence rates were 0% at 6 months and 4.8% at 12 and 18 months. These data compare with prior studies showing an ulcer recurrence rate up to 67% at 12 months with compression alone.\nPatients with CEAP 5 healed venous ulcers that undergo endovenous ablation of incompetent superficial and perforating veins and maintain compression have reduced ulcer recurrence rates compared with historical controls that are treated with compression alone.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated whether remote (rIPC) and local ischemic preconditioning (IPC) similarly limit skeletal muscle dysfunction induced by aortic cross-clamping.\nRats were divided in three groups: the sham-operated control group (C) underwent surgery without clamping. The ischemia-reperfusion group (IR) had 3 hours of ischemia induced by aortic clamping and collateral vessels ligation, followed by 2 hours of reperfusion. The IPC group had, before prolonged ischemia, three bouts of 10 minutes of ischemia and 10 minutes of reperfusion on the right hind limb. Thus, right hind limbs had local IPC and left hind limbs had rIPC. Complexes I, II, III, and IV activities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain of the gastrocnemius muscle were measured using glutamate-malate (V(max)), succinate (V(succ)), and N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (TMPD)-ascorbate (V(TMPD)). Expressions of genes involved in apoptosis (Bax, Bcl-2) and antioxidant defense (superoxide dismutase 1 [SOD 1], SOD2, glutathione peroxidase [GPx]) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Glutathione was also measured.\nRight and left hind limb mitochondrial functions were similar in controls and after IR. IR reduced V(max) (-21.2%, 6.6 \u00b1 1 vs 5.2 \u00b1 1 \u03bcmol O(2)/min/g dry weight, P = .001), V(succ) (-22.2%, P = .032), and V(TMPD) (-22.4%, P = .033), and increased Bax (63.4%, P = .020) and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (+84.6%, P = .029). SODs and GPx messenger RNA were not modified, but glutathione tended to be decreased after IR. Local IPC and rIPC counteracted similarly these deleterious effects, restoring mitochondrial maximal oxidative capacities and normalizing Bax, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and glutathione.\nRemote ischemic preconditioning protection against IR injury is equivalent to that achieved by local IPC. It might deserve a broader use in clinical practice.\nAcute and chronic ischemia induce mitochondrial dysfunction in human skeletal muscles, and improving muscle mitochondrial function improves subjects\u2019 status. Compared with local ischemic preconditioning (IPC), remote IPC (rIPC) appears easier to perform and is safer for the vessel and territory involved in ischemic injury. This study demonstrates that the muscle protection afforded by rIPC is equivalent to that achieved by IPC. Acknowledging that IPC procedures should be specifically adapted to patient characteristics to be successful, our results support a broader use of rIPC in the setting of vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "We compared clinical outcomes between limbs with and without achievement of feeding artery flow by endovascular therapy (EVT) based on the angiosome concept in critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients with isolated below-the-knee (BTK) lesions and assessed factors influencing major amputation (MA).\nWe analyzed 369 limbs from 329 consecutive patients (224 men; age, 70 \u00b1 11 years) with ischemic ulceration or gangrene, or both, presenting with isolated BTK lesions (Rutherford class 5, 270 limbs; class 6, 99 limbs) with a pretreatment ankle-brachial index of 0.79 \u00b1 0.26. Patients underwent successful EVT, without bypass surgery. Limbs were classified into direct (n = 200) and indirect (n = 169) groups by whether feeding artery flow to the site of ulceration or gangrene was successfully achieved, based on the angiosome concept. Unadjusted and adjusted (by propensity score matching) between-group rates of amputation-free survival (AFS) and freedom from major amputation (MA) and major adverse limb event (MALE) were compared by Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test. The independent determinants of MA in the direct and indirect groups were explored by multivariable analysis.\nDuring follow-up (mean, 18 \u00b1 16 months), the overall limb salvage rate was 81% (300 of 369), death occurred in 36% (119 of 329), and the reintervention rate was 31% (114 of 369). After propensity score adjustment, the estimated (\u00b1 standard error) rates for AFS (49% \u00b1 8% vs 29% \u00b1 6%; P = .0002), freedom from MALE (51% \u00b1 8% vs 28% \u00b1 8%, P = .008), and major amputation (82% \u00b1 5% vs 68% \u00b1 5%, P = .01) were significantly higher in the direct group than in the indirect group for up to 4 years after the index procedure. After multivariable Cox proportional analysis, the independent factors associated with major amputation were hemoglobin A(1c) level (hazard ratio [HR], 1.4; 95% confidential interval [CI], 1.1-1.9; P = .006) and cilostazol administration (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11-0.70; P = .006) in the direct group, and C-reactive protein level (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.4; P = .002) in the indirect group.\nAchieving direct flow by angioplasty based on the angiosome concept in CLI patients with isolated BTK lesions is clinically important for AFS and freedom from MA and MALE.

    "abstract": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a highly prevalent comorbidity among patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. The effect of CHF on the procedural success of endovascular treatment, however, remains unknown. Theoretically, poor inflow secondary to systolic dysfunction and peripheral vascular alterations may predispose endovascular interventions to failure.\nA retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed to identify CHF patients undergoing endovascular peripheral arterial intervention from 2004 to 2009. Demographics, comorbidities, procedural details, and outcomes were analyzed. Patients underwent duplex ultrasound imaging and clinical follow-up at scheduled intervals. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate risk factors for loss of primary patency, secondary patency, and limb salvage.\nOf 1220 patients undergoing intervention, 271 (22%) with documented congestive heart failure (CHF) underwent an intervention for claudication (22.5%) or critical limb ischemia (77.5%). Primary patency at 1 year was 51.9% \u00b1 2.5% among those with CHF vs 64.6% \u00b1 1.3% in those without CHF (P < .001); this disparity continued throughout follow-up (P < .001). Patients with CHF also had reduced secondary patency throughout follow-up. Multivariate analysis showed CHF was an independent predictor of reduced primary patency (hazard ratio [HR], 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-1.4; P = .038) and secondary patency (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8; P < .001). In the setting of CHF, 1-year patency was 56.6% \u00b1 4.1% if the ejection fraction (EF) was >40% (n = 147) vs 43.2% \u00b1 3.5% if the EF was <40% (n = 124; P < .001). Secondary patency was also significantly reduced in patients with EF <40% throughout follow-up compared with patients without CHF (n = 949) as well as those with CHF and EF >40% (P < .001). CHF with EF <40% was an independent predictor of reduced primary patency (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8; P < .01) and secondary patency (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.3; P < .001). Limb salvage was also worse in patients with EF <40% (P = .038).\nCHF is associated with reduced patency after peripheral endovascular intervention and is an independent risk factor for patency loss. Specifically, CHF and reduced EF (<40%) is a strong independent risk factor for patency loss.",

Primary patency at 1 year was 51.9% \u00b1 2.5% among those with CHF vs 64.6% \u00b1 1.3% in those without CHF (P < .001); this disparity continued throughout follow-up (P < .001). Patients with CHF also had reduced secondary patency throughout follow-up. Multivariate analysis showed CHF was an independent predictor of reduced primary patency (hazard ratio [HR], 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-1.4; P = .038) and secondary patency (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8; P < .001).

Secondary patency was also significantly reduced in patients with EF <40% throughout follow-up compared with patients without CHF (n = 949) as well as those with CHF and EF >40% (P < .001). CHF with EF <40% was an independent predictor of reduced primary patency (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8; P < .01) and secondary patency (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.3; P < .001).

    "abstract": "Ischemia is a major factor contributing to failure of skin flap surgery, which is routinely used for coverage of wounds to prevent infection and to restore form and function. An emerging concept is that adenosine A(2A) receptors can improve tissue oxygenation by stimulating angiogenesis, likely through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This study assessed the ability of polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) to restore blood flow and improve wound healing, acting through the A(2A) receptor, in a rat model of ischemic skin flaps.\nThe H-shaped double-flap model was used in male Sprague-Dawley rats. After surgical procedures, the animals were randomized to receive intraperitoneal PDRN (8 mg/kg) or vehicle (NaCl 0.9%). Rats were euthanized 3, 5, and 10 days after skin injury, after the evaluation of skin perfusion by laser Doppler. The wounds underwent histologic analysis and were measured for VEGF messenger RNA and protein expression, hypoxia inducible factor-1-\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expression, and nitrite content.\nBlood flow markedly increased in blood flow in ischemic flaps treated with PDRN, with a complete recovery starting from day 5 (ischemic flap + vehicle, 1.80 \u00b1 0.25; ischemic flap + PDRN, 2.46 \u00b1 0.25; P < .001). Administration of PDRN enhanced the expression of VEGF (ischemic flap + vehicle, 5.3 \u00b1 0.6; ischemic flap + PDRN, 6.2 \u00b1 0.5; P < .01) at day 5, and iNOS (ischemic flap + vehicle, 3.9 \u00b1 0.6; ischemic flap + PDRN, 5.3 \u00b1 1; P < .01), but reduced HIF-1\u03b1 expression (ischemic flap + vehicle, 7 \u00b1 1.1; ischemic flap + PDRN, 4.8 \u00b1 0.5; P < .05) at day 3. Histologically, the PDRN-treated group showed complete re-epithelialization and well-formed granulation tissue rich in fibroblasts.\nThese results suggest that PDRN restores blood flow and tissue architecture, probably by modulating HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF expression, and may be an effective therapeutic approach in improving healing of ischemic skin flaps.",

    "abstract": "A novel self-expanding drug-eluting stent was designed to release everolimus 225 \u03bcg/cm(2) to prevent restenosis following peripheral arterial intervention. The purpose of this study was to measure the pharmacokinetic profile of everolimus following stent implantation.\nOne hundred four patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease underwent implantation of everolimus-eluting stents in the femoropopliteal arteries. In a prespecified subset of 26 patients, blood samples for assay of everolimus content were collected prior to stent implantation, at 1, 4, and 8 hours postprocedure, prior to discharge, and at 1 month postprocedure.\nA total of 39 stents, ranging from 28 mm to 100 mm in length, were implanted in 26 patients, resulting in a total delivered everolimus dose range of 3.0 to 7.6 mg. Following the procedure, the maximum observed everolimus blood concentrations (C(max)) varied from 1.83 \u00b1 0.05 ng/mL after implantation of a single 80-mm stent to 4.66 \u00b1 1.78 ng/mL after implantation of two 100-mm stents. The mean time to peak concentration (T(max)) varied from 6.8 hours to 35 hours. The pharmacokinetics of everolimus were dose-proportional in that dose-normalized C(max) and area under the curve values were constant over the studied dose range.\nAfter implantation of everolimus-eluting self-expanding stents in the femoropopliteal arteries, systemic blood concentrations of everolimus are predictable and considerably lower than blood concentrations observed following safe oral administration of everolimus.",

To ensure effective endovascular treatment, we used transarterial, transvenous, percutaneous, or combined access routes. Treatment outcomes were assessed with periodic computed tomography angiograms and clinical examinations.\nDuring the follow-up period (mean, 33.2 months; median, 21.3 months; range, 1-96 months) after embolosclerotherapy, we observed complete remission (no residual or recurrent AVM lesion on follow-up computed tomography and complete symptomatic relief) in 10 (83.3%) patients and partial remission in two (16.7%) patients. One major complication of focal bladder necrosis occurred (1/22 sessions, 4.5%, 1/12 patients, 8.3%), but this resolved with conservative treatment. As early procedure-related complications, transient pulmonary hypertension and/or hemoglobinuria developed in 54.5% (12/22 sessions) and 22.7% (5/22 sessions) of patients, respectively.\nCombined embolosclerotherapy of pelvic AVMs with coils and ethanol was efficacious at achieving complete remission.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine if statin therapy improves clinical outcomes after endovascular intervention in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI).\nA retrospective review of all patients undergoing endovascular treatment for CLI was performed. Two groups were created according to whether they were receiving statin therapy at the time of intervention. Demographics, lesion morphology, overall mortality, primary and secondary patency, and limb salvage were compared between these groups. Analysis was performed using multivariate regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis.\nBetween 2004 and 2009, 646 patients, 319 receiving statin therapy and 327 without, underwent an endovascular intervention for CLI. The statin group had significantly higher rates of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting (P < .05). The two groups had similar lesion length, location, lesion type, TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) classification, and primary procedure. At 24 months, the statin-treated group had higher rates of primary patency (43% vs 33%; P = .007), secondary patency (66% vs 51%; P = .001), limb salvage (83% vs 62%; P = .001), and overall survival (77% vs 62%; P = .038). Statin therapy was also independently associated with improved limb salvage by multivariate regression analysis (hazard ratio, 2.55; P < .001).\nPatients who were receiving statin therapy when they underwent interventions to treat CLI had significantly improved overall survival, primary and secondary patency, and limb salvage rates. Our findings suggest that statins should be part of the periprocedural treatment regimen and support further investigation into the beneficial effects of statins in patients undergoing endovascular treatment of CLI.",

The two groups had similar lesion length, location, lesion type, TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) classification, and primary procedure. At 24 months, the statin-treated group had higher rates of primary patency (43% vs 33%; P = .007), secondary patency (66% vs 51%; P = .001), limb salvage (83% vs 62%; P = .001), and overall survival (77% vs 62%; P = .038). Statin therapy was also independently associated with improved limb salvage by multivariate regression analysis (hazard ratio, 2.55; P < .001).",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cell (EC) migration is essential for arterial healing after angioplasty. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins and oxidative stress decrease EC migration in vitro. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of hypercholesterolemia and oxidative stress on EC healing after an arterial injury.\nC57BL/6 wild-type mice were placed in one of eight groups: chow diet (n = 11), high-cholesterol (HC) diet (n = 11), chow diet plus paraquat (n = 11), HC diet plus paraquat (n = 11), chow diet plus N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (n = 11), HC diet plus NAC (n = 11), chow diet plus paraquat and NAC (n = 11), and HC diet plus paraquat and NAC (n = 11). After 2 weeks on the assigned diet with or without NAC, the carotid artery was injured using electrocautery. Animals in the paraquat groups were given 1 mg/kg intraperitoneally to increase oxidative stress. After 120 hours, Evans Blue dye was infused intravenously to stain the area of the artery that remained deendothelialized. This was used to calculate the percentage of re-endothelialization. Plasma and tissue samples were analyzed for measures of oxidative stress.\nThe HC diet increased oxidative stress and reduced EC healing compared with a chow diet, with EC covering 26.8% \u00b1 2.8% and 48.1% \u00b1 5.2% (P < .001) of the injured area, respectively. Administration of paraquat decreased healing in both chow and HC animals to 18.1% \u00b1 3.5% (P < .001) and 9.8% \u00b1 4.6% (P < .001), respectively. Pretreatment with NAC (120 mmol/L in drinking water) for 2 weeks prior to injury, to decrease oxidative stress, improved EC healing to 39.9% \u00b1 5.7% (P < .001) in hypercholesterolemic mice and to 30.7% \u00b1 3.6% (P < .001) in the paraquat group. NAC treatment improved healing to 24.6% \u00b1 3.4% (P < .001) in hypercholesterolemic mice treated with paraquat.\nRe-endothelialization of arterial injuries is reduced in hypercholesterolemic mice and is inversely correlated with oxidative stress. An oral antioxidant decreases oxidative stress and improves EC healing.\nVascular injury following cardiovascular intervention, including cardiac and peripheral arterial angioplasty and stenting, is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress. Hypercholesterolemia is also associated with increased oxidative stress. Oxidative stress, regardless of the source, induces cellular dysfunction in endothelial and smooth muscle cells that reduce healing after arterial injury. Decreasing oxidative stress with an exogenously administered antioxidant can improve endothelial cell healing, and this is important to control intimal hyperplasia and reduce the thrombogenicity of the vessel.",

    "abstract": "Some patients with aortic arch or descending thoracic aorta pathologies are not suited for open repair because of comorbidities that may increase their risk of procedural complications or death. Endovascular approaches may also be difficult when there are inadequate proximal landing zones in the aortic arch. We report our experience using rerouting techniques with bypass, stenting of the branches, or a combination of both to create a landing area in zones 0 and 1 of the aortic arch.\nSince November 2002, thoracic aortic endoluminal grafts were placed in 38 patients in whom the endograft was deployed in zone 0 (n = 27) or zone 1 (n = 11). A retrospective review is included.\nThere were 11 women and 27 men with a mean age of 65.4 years (range 38-88). Aortic pathology included 12 Stanford type A dissections, 10 aortic arch aneurysms, 8 Stanford type B dissections, 3 descending thoracic aortic aneurysms, 2 aortobronchial fistulas, 1 innominate artery aneurysm and 2 aortic arch pseudoaneurysms. In zone 0, 21 had thoracic debranching with an ascending bypass, three patients had a remote-inflow and three patients had a chimney-stent with carotid-carotid bypass. In zone 1, five patients had a carotid-carotid bypass, one patient had an aortic to left common carotid artery (LCCA) bypass and five patients had chimney-stent on the LCCA. Fifty-eight percent of the patients were symptomatic and 26% emergent. Three patients required hemodialysis postoperatively (7.9%), 18 patients (47.4%) required prolonged mechanical ventilation for respiratory insufficiency. Paraplegia occurred in one patient (2.7%), and five patients suffered a cerebrovascular accident (13.1%). There were four early type I and two type II endoleaks. Overall 30-day mortality was 23.7%.\nThe hybrid approach for repair of the aortic arch pathologies is feasible in patients unfit for open repair. We present the results of performing different techniques to treat the aortic arch with hybrid repair with antegrade or retrograde inflow, stenting of the branches or a combination of both. Long-term results are unknown, and larger series results and comparative studies are needed to determine safety and efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Controversy persists as to whether all calf vein thrombi should be treated with anticoagulation or observed with duplex surveillance. We performed a systematic review of the literature to assess whether data could support either approach, followed by examination of its natural history by stratifying results according to early clot propagation, pulmonary emboli (PE), recurrence, and postthrombotic syndrome (PTS).\nA total of 1513 articles were reviewed that were published from January 1975 to August 2010 using computerized database searches of PubMed, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and extensive cross-references. English-language studies specifically examining calf deep vein thrombosis (C-DVT) defined as axial and/or muscular veins of the calf, not involving the popliteal vein, were included. Papers were independently reviewed by two investigators (E.M., F.L.) and quality graded based on nine methodologic standards reporting on four outcome parameters.\nOf the 1513 citations reviewed, 31 relevant papers meeting predefined criteria were found: six randomized controlled trials (RCT) and 25 observational cohort studies or case series. There was a single RCT directly comparing anticoagulation with no anticoagulation with compression and duplex surveillance, and they found no difference in propagation, PE, or bleeding in a low-risk population. Based on two studies of moderately strong methodology, C-DVT propagation was reduced with anticoagulation. When treatment was unassigned, moderately strong evidence suggested that about 15% propagate to the popliteal vein or higher. However, based on nonrandomized data but with moderate to high quality (level A and B studies), propagation to popliteal or higher was 8% in those with no anticoagulation treated with surveillance only. Propagation involving adjacent calf veins but remaining in the calf occured in up to one-half of all those who propagate. Major bleeding was an intended endpoint in three RCTs and was reported as 0% to 6%, with a trend toward lower bleeding risk in more recent studies. PE during surveillance in studies with unassigned treatment was strikingly lower than the historical reports of PE recorded at presentation, emphasizing the distinction that must be made between the two entities. Recurrence in C-DVT is lower than thigh DVT, and data suggest that in low-risk groups with transient risk factors, 6 weeks of anticoagulation may be sufficient, as opposed to 12 weeks. Studies of PTS reported that patients with C-DVT had fewer symptoms than their thigh DVT counterparts. Approximately one out of 10 showed symptoms of CEAP Class 4 to 6; however, C5 or C6 with healed or active ulceration were not commonly encountered.\nNo study of strong methodology could be found to resolve the controversy of optimal treatment of C-DVT. Given the risks of propagation, PE, and recurrence, the option of doing nothing should be considered unacceptable. In the absence of strong evidence to support anticoagulation over imaging surveillance with selective anticoagulation, either method of managing calf DVT must remain as current acceptable standards.",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasound (DU) surveillance (DUS) criteria for vein graft stenosis and thresholds for reintervention are well established. The natural history of DU-detected stenosis and the threshold criteria for reintervention in patients undergoing endovascular therapy (EVT) of the femoropopliteal system have yet to be determined. We report an analysis of routine DUS after infrainguinal EVT.\nConsecutive patients undergoing EVT of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) or popliteal artery were prospectively enrolled in a DUS protocol (\u22641 week after intervention, then at 3, 6, and 12 months thereafter). Peak systolic velocity (PSV) and velocity ratio (Vr) were used to categorize the treated artery: normal was PSV <200 cm/s and Vr <2, moderate stenosis was PSV = 200-300 cm/s or Vr = 2-3, and severe stenosis was PSV >300 cm/s or Vr >3. Reinterventions were generally performed for persistent or recurrent symptoms, allowing us to analyze the natural history of DU-detected lesions and to perform sensitivity and specificity analysis for DUS criteria predictive of failure.\nNinety-four limbs (85 patients) underwent EVT for SFA-popliteal disease and were prospectively enrolled in a DUS protocol. The initial scans were normal in 61 limbs (65%), and serial DU results remained normal in 38 (62%). In 17 limbs (28%), progressive stenoses were detected during surveillance. The rate of thrombosis in this subgroup was 10%. Moderate stenoses were detected in 28 (30%) limbs at initial scans; of these, 39% resolved or stabilized, 47% progressed to severe, and occlusions developed in 14%. Five (5%) limbs harbored severe stenoses on initial scans, and 80% of lesions resolved or stabilized. Progression to occlusion occurred in one limb (20%). The last DUS showed 25 limbs harbored severe stenoses; of these, 13 (52%) were in symptomatic patients and thus required reintervention regardless of DU findings. Eleven limbs (11%) eventually occluded. Sensitivity and specificity of DUS to predict occlusion were 88% and 60%, respectively.\nDUS does not reliably predict arterial occlusion after EVT. Stenosis after EVT appears to have a different natural history than restenosis after vein graft bypass. EVT patients are more likely to have severe stenosis when they present with recurrent symptoms, in contrast to vein graft patients, who commonly have occluded grafts when they present with recurrent symptoms. The potential impact of routine DU-directed reintervention in patients after EVT is questionable. The natural history of DU-detected stenosis after femoropopliteal endovascular therapy suggests questionable clinical utility of routine DUS.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery aneurysms, although rare, are increasing in frequency due to their association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Our institution serves a population with a high HIV prevalence and we wished to document our growing experience with this aneurysmal pathology in a setting of an ever-increasing burden of HIV disease.\nData on all patients managed at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital in Durban, South Africa, from July 2003 to December 2009 with HIV carotid aneurysms were extracted from a prospective vascular database and their case records were examined. Twenty-two patients were identified of whom 21 had preoperative imaging and underwent some form of intervention.\nThe initial presentation in 19 of the 22 patients was a progressively enlarging neck mass and pain. Ten patients presented with neurology with only 1 patient presenting with a hemiplegia and 1 patient with a monoplegia. Sixteen patients had an open operative repair and 5 patients had an endovascular repair performed as the initial procedure. Of the open procedure, 8 patients had an interposition graft used and 8 had ligation of the common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA), and/or internal carotid artery (ICA). Eighteen patients had no immediate postoperative neurological complications. The worst outcomes were from patients who underwent an endovascular procedure. These included one death, two thrombosed stents, and one endoleak. Histology showed active tuberculosis (TB) in 6 patients who were not known to have TB preoperatively. The overall mortality was 3 of 22 patients.\nWe have noted aneurysms of the carotid artery to occur in patients who are infected with HIV and it seems to be that the incidence of such aneurysms is more common than documented. Open surgical intervention either in the form of an interposition graft or ligation seems to be the more effective treatment option as compared to endovascular stenting. Stenting should be reserved for those patients unfit for open surgery.",

Treatment has traditionally been surgical, but advances in endovascular technology have led to a few recent reports of therapy with coils. We report 2 cases of TIF with massive hemorrhage that underwent successful treatment with endovascular occlusion. Endovascular repair is less invasive than open surgical repair and usually associated with a shorter recovery period. However, this technique may require multiple coils to inhibit blood flow into the fistula. This procedure should be considered one of the useful treatments for TIF.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the use of the sugarcane biopolymer membrane in femoral vein patch angioplasty on dogs.\nEight dogs were submitted to bilateral femoral vein patch angioplasty with a sugarcane biopolymer membrane patch on one side and an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) patch on the contralateral side. This research was performed at Experimental Surgical Research Laboratory of the Centro de Ci\u00eancias da Sa\u00fade at Universidade Federal de Pernambuco. The dogs underwent new surgery at 180 days after the patch angioplasty in order to harvest the femoral vein. All the animals were evaluated by clinical examination, measure of femoral vein diameter, venogram, and Doppler fluxometry. The material harvested was sent for histologic study. Each animal served as its own control.\nIn all veins of both groups, there were no cases of infection, rupture, or pseudoaneurysm formation and thrombosis. In both groups, a chronic inflammatory reaction was observed, with lymphocytes, neutrophils, and fibrosis in the outer surface of the patches. Fibrosis was seen in the inner surfaces of all the patches. In e-PTFE patches, invasion by fibroblasts occurred.\nThe sugarcane biopolymer membrane can be used as a patch in femoral vein angioplasty on dogs.\nThe sugarcane biopolymer membrane is easily synthesized with a low cost of production. This membrane has been used in many areas of experimental surgery as in the healing of skin wounds, in urinary reconstruction, in reconstruction of tympanic membrane, and as an arterial substitute, but there is no report of its use as a vein substitute. In order to evaluate the possibility of using the sugarcane biopolymer membrane in venous reconstructive surgery, this study analyzed its utilization in femoral vein patch angioplasty.",

    "abstract": "The key questions addressed in this summary are whether clot removal should be part of the preferred therapy for patients with acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and whether there is evidence that a strategy of thrombus removal offers better outcomes for patients than anticoagulation alone. Evidence is defined as an outward sign or something that furnishes proof. Evidence in medicine is not limited to direct, blinded comparisons of one form of treatment compared with another but rather the body of knowledge that provides insight to clinicians to offer patient care. Evidence-based medicine follows from information available to form the foundation for the use of a treatment for a specific disease. Reports of strategies of thrombus removal for acute DVT, especially in patients with iliofemoral DVT, consistently demonstrate improved outcomes relative to postthrombotic morbidity. This summary reviews the evidence supporting this strategy as the preferred initial management of patients with extensive proximal DVT.",

    "abstract": "The primary goal of this study was to determine whether exposure to endovascular simulator training increases interest in vascular surgery among medical students. Secondary goals were to determine whether interest in vascular surgery is inversely related to the time after exposure, to identify factors associated with interest, and to identify students' characteristics that positively influence performance metrics.\nThis was a prospective, randomized, crossover study comprising 80 medical students who were randomized into group A (n = 40) and group B (n = 40). Participants completed a survey of their interest in vascular surgery and attitudinal factors using Vascular Surgery Interest Form (VSIF) before exposure to the simulator (pretest). At 1 month after exposure of group A to the simulator, both groups were tested using VSIF (test). Upon completion of testing, group B was exposed to simulator training, whereas group A received no further training. At 2 months after exposure of group B to the simulator, both groups were posttested using VSIF, which asked the students' level of interest in vascular surgery using a 1 to 10 scale. Performance metrics were recorded during each exposure. Differences among cohort demographics were determined using Pearson \u03c7(2) analysis. Differences in interest were determined with paired sample correlations. Linear regression and analysis of variance were used to correlate VSIF responses with interest and the performance metrics.\nBoth student cohorts had significant increases in interest after exposure to simulation. In group A, test interest (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) was significantly higher than pretest and posttest interests (5.51 \u00b1 1.73 vs 4.00 \u00b1 1.88 vs 4.18 \u00b1 1.82; P < .05). In group B, posttest interest was significantly higher than pretest and test interests (5.62 \u00b1 2.03 vs 3.96 \u00b1 1.61 vs 4.08 \u00b1 1.64; P < .05). The increase in interest was reciprocally related to the time passed since the initial exposure. Resident and attending lifestyle, length of training, radiation concerns, gender identification of a mentor, and personality fit with occupation were not correlated with interest. Sex, medical school year, comfort with endovascular procedures, willingness to work long hours, interest in performing percutaneous procedures, and commitment to surgical career did not affect impact performance metrics.\nOne exposure of students to endovascular simulator training is associated with an increase in vascular surgery interest. Acquired interest is reciprocally related to the time demonstrating the temporal importance of the exposure.",

    "abstract": "Recent randomized controlled trials have shown that age significantly affects the outcome of carotid revascularization procedures. This study used data from the Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Registry (VR) to report the influence of age on the comparative effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS).\nVR collects provider-reported data on patients using a Web-based database. Patients were stratified by age and symptoms. The primary end point was the composite outcome of death, stroke, or myocardial infarction (MI) at 30 days.\nAs of December 7, 2010, there were 1347 CEA and 861 CAS patients aged < 65 years and 4169 CEA and 2536 CAS patients aged \u2265 65 years. CAS patients in both age groups were more likely to have a disease etiology of radiation or restenosis, be symptomatic, and have more cardiac comorbidities. In patients aged <65 years, the primary end point (5.23% CAS vs 3.56% CEA; P = .065) did not reach statistical significance. Subgroup analyses showed that CAS had a higher combined death/stroke/MI rate (4.44% vs 2.10%; P < .031) in asymptomatic patients but there was no difference in the symptomatic (6.00% vs 5.47%; P = .79) group. In patients aged \u2265 65 years, CEA had lower rates of death (0.91% vs 1.97%; P < .01), stroke (2.52% vs 4.89%; P < .01), and composite death/stroke/MI (4.27% vs 7.14%; P < .01). CEA in patients aged \u2265 65 years was associated with lower rates of the primary end point in symptomatic (5.27% vs 9.52%; P < .01) and asymptomatic (3.31% vs 5.27%; P < .01) subgroups. After risk adjustment, CAS patients aged \u2265 65 years were more likely to reach the primary end point.\nCompared with CEA, CAS resulted in inferior 30-day outcomes in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients aged \u2265 65 years. These findings do not support the widespread use of CAS in patients aged \u2265 65 years.",

    "abstract": "Aneurysmal regression is a reliable marker for long-lasting success after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The aim of this study was to identify the preoperative factors that can predictably lead to aneurysmal sac regression after EVAR, according to the reporting standards of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the International Society of Cardiovascular Surgery (SVS/ISCVS).\nFrom 199 patients treated by EVAR between 2000 and 2009, 164 completed computed tomography angiographies and duplex scan follow-up images were available. All computed tomography angiographies for enrolled patients in this retrospective study were analyzed with Endosize software (Therenva, Rennes, France) to provide spatially correct 3-dimensional data in accordance with SVS/ISCVS recommendations. Anatomic parameters were graded according to the relevant severity grades. A severity score was calculated at the aortic neck, the abdominal aortic aneurysm, and the iliac arteries. Clinical and demographic factors were studied. Patients with aneurysmal regression >5 mm were assigned to group A (mean age, 71.4 \u00b1 8.9 years) and the others to group B (76.3 \u00b1 8.3 years).\nAneurysmal regression occurred in 66 patients (40.2%; group A). Univariate analyses showed smaller severity scores at the aortic neck (P = .02) and the iliac arteries (P = .002) in group A and calcifications and thrombus were less significant at the aortic neck (P = .003 and P = .02) and at the iliac arteries (P = .001 and P = .02), and inferior mesenteric artery patency was less frequent (68.2% vs 82.7%, P = .04). Two multivariate analyses were done: one considered the scores and the other the variables included in the scores. In the first, the patients of group A were younger (P = .002) and aortic neck calcifications were less significant (P = .007). In the second, group A patients were younger (P < .001) and the aortic neck scores were smaller (P = .04). There was no difference between the two groups in the type of implanted endoprosthesis or in the follow-up (group A: 46.4 \u00b1 24 months; group B: 47.2 \u00b1 22 months; P = .35).\nIn this study, the young age of the patients and their aortic neck quality, in particular the absence of neck calcification, appear to have been the main factors affecting aneurysm shrinkage, such that they represent a target population for the improvement of EVAR results.",

Results were analyzed with \u03c7(2) or independent t-test.\nTwenty-five patients (31 limbs) underwent operation, which included arterial reconstruction with or without inguinal ligament release. The average patient age at operation was 43.8 \u00b1 5.0 for graft and 35.1 \u00b1 1.9 for patch (P = .08). The average time from competitive cycling until operation was 18.2 \u00b1 5.8 years for graft and 20.0 \u00b1 2.5 for patch repairs (NS). Patients included 14 males and 11 females. There were 23 unilateral and four bilateral arterial reconstructions, including 26 patch angioplasties for localized disease and five interposition grafts for extensive disease; three patients underwent contralateral reconstruction as a separate procedure. Concomitant ipsilateral inguinal ligament release was performed in 25 patients (28 limbs), with contralateral release done in 12 patients (12 limbs). Three patients with isolated ligament release required subsequent arterial intervention. Follow-up averaged 32 months (range, 2-74). Primary patency for all reconstructions was 100%; the four reoperations (five limbs; one bilateral) were for symptom recurrence, two postgraft and two postangioplasty. Three reoperations were for recurrent intimal hyperplasia, one for disease distal to the anastomosis, and one for concomitant atherosclerotic disease. Based on available data, postexercise ankle-brachial indices were improved in 18 of 23 limbs. Seventeen patients completed questions regarding satisfaction: 10 were satisfied or very satisfied (zero graft, 10 patch; P = .25), while four were unsatisfied (three graft, two patch; P = .017, including one patient with both a patch and graft repair). All 20 patients for whom follow-up data were available are still cycling, 10 competitively. Two of the four reoperated patients were unsatisfied; all four are still cycling, one competitively.\nExternal iliac arteriopathy is a disease of prolonged, sustained, and repetitive trauma. Patch angioplasty yields a low rate of reoperation, more satisfied patients, return to competitive activity, and improvement in postexercise ankle-brachial indices. Interposition grafting is associated with slightly older patients, more extensive disease, and less satisfying results. Intimal hyperplasia is the most frequent complication necessitating reoperation. Both the decision to pursue arterial reconstruction and patient expectations must be tempered by the pattern of disease and the potential for unsatisfactory results.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzes the experience of a single center using hybrid stainless steel-based endovascular stent graft repair of acute complicated and chronic type B aortic dissection aneurysm, and assesses the proximal and distal aortic morphologic changes of the midterm results.\nBetween November 2006 and March 2011, 61 patients with type B aortic dissection underwent stainless steel-based stent graft repair and were divided into an acute complicated dissection group (AD; n = 33) and a chronic dissection aneurysm group (CD; n = 28). Serial computed tomography (CT) images were obtained to evaluate the changes of true and false lumen diameter at four levels during the postoperative period.\nThe stent graft was successfully implanted in all patients (100%), with two surgical mortalities in the AD group and low perioperative morbidity (3.6%) of stroke and paraplegia. The cumulative survival rates of the two groups were similar (77.6% and 89.0%; P = .585) in a mean follow-up period of 24.1 \u00b1 15.6 months. Complete thrombosis of the thoracic false lumen down to the diaphragm level was achieved in 80.6% of the patients in the AD group and 88.5% in the CD group without significant difference (P = .221), but the complete regression rate of the thoracic false lumen down to the diaphragm level showed a tendency of propitious remodeling in the AD group (54.8% vs 30.8%; P = .068). During follow-up, despite the proximal changes of stented true and adjacent false lumen diameter being significantly increased and decreased, respectively, in both acute and chronic settings (P < .05), they were less prominent at the distal aorta in the CD aneurysm group. Intimomedial erosion of the distal end of the stent graft occurred in both acute (n = 6; 18.9%) and chronic (n = 10; 35.7%; P = .121) dissection settings after mean follow-up of 14.0 \u00b1 4.8 months in the AD group and 24.8 \u00b1 5.9 months in the CD group. Three patients with chronic dissection developed either pseudoaneurysm or true lumen compromise by expanded false lumen thrombi and required re-endografting.\nEndovascular stainless steel-based stent graft implantation with vascular bypass to gain a sufficient proximal landing zone is feasible for type B aortic dissection and has low early and midterm mortality and morbidity in both the acute and chronic phases. Although early intervention might result in more favorable aortic remodeling with a higher possibility of complete regression and lower risk of late distal erosion, longer-term follow-up still necessitates continuous careful surveillance of the entire aorta, especially the distal condition.",

    "abstract": "This prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial determined whether an optimal exercise program length exists to efficaciously change claudication onset time (COT) and peak walking time (PWT) in patients with peripheral artery disease and claudication.\nThe study randomized 142 patients to supervised exercise (n = 106) or a usual care control group (n = 36), with 80 completing the exercise program and 27 completing the control intervention. The exercise program consisted of intermittent walking to nearly maximal claudication pain 3 days per week. COT and PWT were the primary outcomes obtained from a treadmill exercise test at baseline and bimonthly during the study.\nAfter exercise, changes in COT (P < .001) and PWT (P < .001) were consistently greater than changes after the control intervention. In the exercise program, COT and PWT increased from baseline to month 2 (P < .05) and from months 2 to 4 (P < .05) but did not significantly change from months 4 to 6 (P > .05). When changes were expressed per mile walked during the first 2 months, middle 2 months, and final 2 months of exercise, COT and PWT only increased during the first 2 months (P < .05).\nExercise-mediated gains in COT and PWT occur rapidly within the first 2 months of exercise rehabilitation and are maintained with further training. The clinical significance is that a relatively short 2-month exercise program may be preferred to a longer program to treat claudication because adherence is higher, costs associated with personnel and use of facilities are lower per patient, and more patients can be trained for a given amount of personnel time and resource utilization.",

    "abstract": "Posteversion carotid endarterectomy hypertension has been suggested to be associated with impaired baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS), which has been identified as a factor of prognostic relevance in patients with cardiovascular disease. The aim of this prospective single-center nonrandomized study was to describe the changes of BRS in the early postoperative period after eversion carotid endarterectomy (E-CEA).\nSpontaneous BRS and hemodynamic parameters such as blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were evaluated preoperatively as well as postoperatively after 1 and 3 days using a noninvasive sequential cross-correlation method. Additionally, any modification in vasoactive medication due to BP derangement in the postoperative period was noted. Due to non-normal distribution of BRS, HR, and TPR samples, all measured values were expressed as medians with interquartile range (IQR), and a nonparametric test (Friedman) was performed. After adjustment for multiple testing, differences were considered statistically significant when the two-tailed P value was less than .0036.\nThirty-five patients (mean age, 71 years) with symptomatic or asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis were included. The BRS significantly decreased to a lower level 24 hours after surgery (4.71 ms/mm Hg [3.02-6.1]) than preoperatively (5.95 ms/mm Hg [4.68-10.86]; P < .0001), resulting in a within-patient difference of -2.46 ms/mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], -8.38 - -1.52). This difference (95% CI, [- 1.58 (-8.24 - -0.80)]) persisted at the 72-hour measurements (5.63 ms/mm Hg [3.23-7.69]; P = .0005). The HR, reflecting the sympathetic activity, increased 24 hours after the operation (69 bpm [61.3-77.7]) compared with preoperative values (63 bpm [57.9-73.2]; P = .005) (within-patient difference [95% CI] 3.7 [1.5-8.5]), and this increase reached significance at 72 hours (69 bpm [65.4-77.5]; P = .001) (within-patient difference [95% CI] 5.5 [2.3-8.8]). Values of systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, mean arterial pressure, CO, and TPR were not significantly different between pre- and postoperative measurements. Overall, 23 (66%) patients developed significant postoperative hypertension requiring aggressive management with additional medications.\nE-CEA might have a decreasing influence on BRS, leading to increased sympathetic activity. Investigations of the longer-term effects of impaired BRS are warranted. These findings should be interpreted with caution, noting the limitation of an absent control group.",

    "abstract": "To determine 30-day outcome and quality of life after elective endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in octogenarians.\nFrom March 2009 to May 2011, 1200 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms were treated with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) using the Endurant stent graft were included in the Endurant Stent Graft Natural Selection Global Postmarket Registry (ENGAGE) registry. Among these, 926 (77%) were aged <80 years, and 274 (23%) were aged \u2265 80 years. Quality of life was assessed using composite EuroQoL 5-Dimensions Questionnaire index scores.\nGender was unequally distributed, with more female patients among the octogenarians (P = .043). Octogenarians had a significantly higher American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (P < .001) and differed significantly in baseline risk factors. The younger cohort was more likely to smoke (P < .001) and be alcoholics (P = .005). Octogenarians had larger aortic aneurysm (P = .010) and left iliac artery diameters (P = .017) and greater infrarenal neck angulation (P = .01). The technical success rate was >99% for both cohorts. Octogenarians were more often operated on under general anesthesia (P = .028), had a longer procedure duration (P = .001), and an increased length of hospitalization; both total (P < .001) and postprocedure (P < .001). All-cause mortality and major adverse event rates were similar in the two groups (P = .835 and P = .186, respectively). There was no difference in the number of secondary endovascular procedures or aneurysm rupture at 30 days. At discharge, both groups had reduced health status dimensions, except anxiety/depression, when compared with baseline. At 30 days, the octogenarian group had a lower composite EuroQoL 5-Dimensions Questionnaire index compared with the younger group, indicating a slower recovery (0.83 \u00b1 0.20 vs 0.87 \u00b1 0.16; P = .003).\nOctogenarians can be safely treated using the Endurant stent graft with a high technical rate of success, low perioperative mortality, and no reduction in quality of life. Octogenarians did, however, appear to recover more slowly than younger patients with respect to certain quality of life components. Long-term data are needed to confirm these results.",

    "abstract": "Surgical management of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (NTOS) is controversial due to the lack of predictors of success and difficulties in patient selection. We sought to examine the effects of patient demographics, etiology, duration of symptoms, and the selective use of lidocaine and botulinum toxin anterior scalene blocks on outcomes of patients undergoing transaxillary decompression with first rib resection and scalenotomy for NTOS.\nPatients with NTOS who had failed physical therapy and had transaxillary decompression between 2003 and 2009 were reviewed retrospectively from a prospectively maintained database. Patients were stratified to age groups < 40 and \u2265 40 years old. Bivariate and multivariate statistical models of analysis were used.\nOne hundred fifty-nine procedures (16 patients bilateral; three patients with cervical ribs; 84.3% women; median age, 37 years; range, 21-64 years) were identified. Ninety-six patients were < 40 and 63 were \u2265 40 years old. Etiology was similar in both groups: trauma 43% vs 46% and chronic repetitive motion 57% vs 54%. Duration of symptoms was less in the <40 group (38.4 vs 66 months; P < .05). More patients in the \u2265 40 group had other spine, shoulder, or arm operations (38% vs 18%; P < .05). Median follow-up for the cohort was 12 months. Transaxillary decompression was more likely to relieve symptoms in patients <40 vs \u2265 40 years old (90% vs 78%; P < .05). Lidocaine blocks were positive in 89% (49 of 55 patients) in the <40 group and 93% (43 of 46 patients) in the \u2265 40 group. After adjusting for patient presenting factors in multivariate analysis, the impact of a successful lidocaine block in patients \u2265 40 years old was greater than in patients < 40 years old (improvement of surgical success of 14% in the > 40 group vs 7% in the < 40 group; P = .05). Botulinum toxin blocks were successful in less patients, 38% (eight of 21 patients) in the < 40 group and 52% (12 of 23 patients) in the \u2265 40 group but were not predictive of symptom relief after transaxillary decompression.\nAlthough patients with NTOS < 40 years old achieve more symptom relief overall after transaxillary decompression as compared to patients \u2265 40 years old, the selective use of lidocaine blocks is more beneficial in predicting surgical success in patients \u2265 40 years old given that younger patients < 40 years old seem to do well regardless.",

    "abstract": "Cost-effectiveness has become an important end point in comparing therapies that may be considered to have clinical equipoise. While controversial, some feel that recent multicenter randomized controlled trials have codified clinical equipoise between carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS).\nA retrospective analysis of hospital cost and 30-day clinical outcomes was performed on patients undergoing CEA and CAS between January 1, 2008 and September 30, 2010 at a single tertiary referral institution. Cost, not charges, of the index hospitalization was divided into supply, labor, facility, and miscellaneous categories. All costs were normalized to 2010 values.\nA total of 306 patients underwent either CEA (n = 174) or CAS (n = 132). Mean hospital cost for CAS was $9426 \u00b1 $5776 while CEA cost was $6734 \u00b1 $3935 (P < .0001). This cost differential was driven by the significantly higher direct supply costs for CAS ($5634) vs CEA ($1967) (P \u2264 .0001). The higher costs for CAS were seen consistently in symptomatic, asymptomatic, elective, and urgent subgroups. Patients undergoing CAS who were enrolled in a trial or registry (53.8%) incurred significantly less cost ($7779 \u00b1 $3525) compared to those who were not ($11,279 \u00b1 $7114; P = .0004). Patients undergoing CEA trended toward a higher prevalence of being symptomatic (44.8%) compared to CAS (34.0%; P = .058). Age was not significantly different between patients undergoing CEA and CAS (70.2 vs 72.0, respectively; P = .36). Coronary artery disease was more common in patients undergoing CAS (60.3% vs 39%; P = .0001). The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, hypertension, and diabetes was not significantly different between cohorts. Thirty-day combined stroke/death/myocardial infarction rate was 2.3% (4 of 174) in the CEA group and 3.8% (5 of 132) in the CAS group, P = .5. Overall length of stay (LOS) was 2.1 days in both groups (P = .9). LOS was higher for urgent interventions (7.3-7.5 days) and symptomatic status (2.9-3.5 days) when compared to patients treated electively (1.3-1.4 days).\nTreatment of carotid disease with CAS was 40% more costly than CEA and did not provide better clinical outcomes or a reduction in LOS. These trends were consistent in symptomatic, asymptomatic, urgent, and elective subgroups At present, CAS cannot be considered a cost-effective treatment for carotid disease.",

    "abstract": "Although the superficial femoral vein (SFV) is an accepted treatment for aortic graft infections, this conduit also has potential uses in other areas. Herein, we evaluate our experience using the SFV for arterial and venous bypasses and the arteriovenous (AV) fistula for dialysis access.\nBetween 1999 and 2011, 42 patients underwent a bypass or a thigh AV fistula using the SFV (31 arterial, four central venous, six AV fistulas, and one common carotid-to-vertebral bypass). Indications for arterial bypass included infected graft (20), critical limb ischemia (nine), and failed bypass (six). Indications for central venous bypass were: superior vena cava syndrome (two), vessel reconstruction due to tumor encasement (one), and central vein occlusion from thoracic outlet syndrome (one). All AV fistulas were created after patients sustained bilateral subclavian vein occlusions from failed upper extremity access. The common carotid-to-vertebral bypass was created due to an occluded vertebral artery with resultant stroke.\nKaplan-Meier cumulative patency curves were used. The primary patency rates at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years were 97.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 92.41-100), 74.6% (95% CI, 57.89-96.23), and 66.4% (95% CI, 47.06-93.53), respectively. The assisted primary patency rates at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years were 100% (95% CI, 100-100), 97.1% (95% CI, 91.54-100), and 89% (95% CI, 74.29-100), respectively. Secondary patency rates at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years were 100% (95% CI, 100-100), 97.1% (95% CI, 91.54-100), and 89% (95% CI, 74.29-100), respectively. Limb salvage rates at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years were 97.3% (95% CI, 92.21-100), 93.6% (95% CI, 78.35-100), and 93.6% (95% CI, 78.35-100), respectively. Survival rates at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years were 97.6% (95% CI, 92.95-100), 86% (95% CI, 75.3-98.3), and 86% (95% CI, 75.3-98.3), respectively. Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 8.7 years (mean time, 21 months).

    "abstract": "Several anatomic factors have been identified as predictive of sac behavior after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The effects of statin therapy on aneurysm sac size reduction remain controversial. This study tested the hypothesis that statin therapy enhances aneurysmal sac regression after EVAR.\nThis monocentric retrospective study included patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms treated by EVAR using the Zenith (Cook, Bloomington, Ind) graft device. We excluded patients presenting with perioperative sac enlargement factors such as endoleaks, endotension, infectious, inflammatory, ruptured, or anastomotic aneurysms. We prospectively assessed standard clinical and anatomic data, as well as statin use, at the time of EVAR and during follow-up. The primary end point was the decrease in the largest transverse aortic diameter at 24 months compared with the preoperative diameter.\nAmong 166 patients treated by a Zenith device and meeting the inclusion criteria, 120 were identified as statin users and 46 as nonstatin users, with comparable characteristics. At 24 months of follow-up, statin group patients had a greater aneurysm sac reduction (25% vs 14%; P < .0001). At a threshold of 5 mm in diameter regression, statin use was a positive factor of retraction (odds ratio, 7.93; 95% confidence interval, 3.22-15.52; P < .0001). Multivariate analysis revealed statin use was an independent predictive factor of sac regression (adjusted odds ratio, 9.39; 95% confidence interval, 3.45-25.56).\nThis study showed that statin use was predictive of sac regression after EVAR with the Zenith graft device.

    "abstract": "The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy of three available treatments for acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT): systemic anticoagulation, surgical thrombectomy, and catheter-directed thrombolysis.\nWe searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and Scopus) and sought additional references from experts. Eligible studies enrolled participants with acute iliofemoral DVT and measured the outcomes of interest. Reviewers working independently in duplicate extracted study characteristics, quality, and outcome data (death, pulmonary embolism, local complications, hemorrhagic complications, postthrombotic syndrome, pain, quality of life, and surrogate markers of venous function such as valve competence and patency). We pooled relative risks (RRs) from each study using the random effects model and estimated the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Bayesian indirect comparison techniques were used to compare thrombectomy to catheter-directed thrombolysis.\nWe found 15 unique studies that fulfilled eligibility criteria. When compared to systemic anticoagulation, thrombectomy was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of developing postthrombotic syndrome (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.87), venous reflux (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.46-0.99), and a trend for reduction in the risk of venous obstruction (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.60-1.19). When compared to systemic anticoagulation, pharmacologic catheter-directed thrombolysis was associated with statistically significant reduction in the risk of postthrombotic syndrome (RR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07-0.48), venous obstruction (RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.18-0.37), and a trend for reduction in the risk of venous reflux (RR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.16-1.00). Overall, the quality of evidence was low; downgraded due to the observational nature of the majority of studies, lack of comparability of study cohorts at baseline, loss to follow-up, imprecision, and indirectness of outcomes (surrogacy). There were insufficient data to compare the outcomes of thrombectomy to catheter-directed thrombolysis.\nLow-quality evidence suggests that surgical thrombectomy decreases the incidence of postthrombotic syndrome and venous reflux. Catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis decreases the incidence of postthrombotic syndrome and venous obstruction.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have examined factors that influence an individual's decision to enter an academic medical career after residency training. We sought to evaluate whether sex, ethnicity, child care issues, and debt burden influenced residents' choice for a career in academic vascular surgery.\nA 39-item Web survey, designed to elucidate which factors motivated residents to seek a career in academic vascular surgery, was sent to 295 vascular surgery residents currently enrolled in Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education-accredited training programs.\nA total of 128 responses (43%) were received. Of these, 53% of respondents were white and 47% were nonwhite and 34 (27%) were women and 94 (73%) were men. Fifty-seven percent of minorities anticipate a career in academic vascular surgery. There were no statistical differences between sex and ethnicity for factors influencing career choice, including training paradigm, presence of a life partner or dependents, mentorship role, participation in research, service, and teaching, anticipated salary, and debt burden (P > .05). Seventy-seven percent of respondents carry significant debt; of those with debt, 81% owe >$100,000 and 40% owe >$200,000. Seventy-three percent of 0+5 trainees anticipated choosing an academic practice compared with 42% of 5+2 trainees (P < .01). Respondents planning an academic career cited procedural variation, breadth and depth of practice/tertiary referral experience, and research opportunities as the most important drivers of career choice. Income potential, strength of the job market, and child care needs were deemed less important.\nThis study shows that academic vascular surgery is a popular career option for current vascular surgery trainees, especially those in 0+5 programs. Choosing a career in academic vascular surgery appears not to be influenced by sex, ethnicity, child care concerns, salary expectations, or debt burden, even though most trainees carry enormous debt. The data imply future academic vascular surgeons will likely have greater gender and ethnic variability than is currently seen.",

    "abstract": "Compression therapy is not common for venous leg ulcer patients in Hong Kong.\nThis randomized controlled trial compared the clinical effectiveness of compression bandaging using four-layer bandaging (4LB) or short-stretch bandaging (SSB) and usual care (moist wound healing dressing without compression). The 24-week study looked at venous leg ulcer patients aged >60 years in a community setting. The primary parameter was time to ulcer healing. Secondary parameters were ulcer area and pain reduction comparing week 0 (start) vs week 24 (end), measuring results per group and between groups. Intention-to-treat analysis involved descriptive statistics, survival analysis, and repeated measures analysis of variance. The log-rank test was used for univariable analysis. All withdrawn patients had a negative outcome score over the whole study duration.\nOf 321 patients who received randomized treatment, 45 (14%) did not complete the 24-week study period. At 24 weeks, Kaplan-Meier analysis on healing time was statistically significant (P < .001) in favor of the compression groups. The mean (SD) healing time in the SSB group (9.9 [0.77]) was shorter than that of the 4LB group (10.4 [0.80]) and the usual care group (18.3 [0.86]). Pain reduction was significant (P < .001) for the compression-treated groups only.\nCompression bandaging was more effective than usual care without compression. Both compression systems were safe and feasible for venous ulcer patients in a community setting in Hong Kong.",

    "abstract": "Population-based screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in elderly men is organized in many regions and countries in the Western world, and the prevalence of disease is reported to decline. Whether the prevalence among those with a family history also is declining is unknown. The primary purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of AAAs among siblings of persons with AAAs and to investigate the proportion of siblings already diagnosed by opportunistic screening.\nPatients treated for AAAs from January 2008 through December 2010 (n = 412) in Stockholm, Sweden, were screened for siblings. Seven hundred seventy-nine siblings were identified. All siblings <80 years residing in Stockholm County were considered eligible and were invited to participate in the study (n = 174). Deceased siblings were not included in the study, regardless of the cause of death. One hundred fifty siblings were enrolled in the study after informed consent was provided. One hundred thirty-four siblings were screened for AAAs with ultrasound scan and maximum aortic, infrarenal, anteroposterior, external (outer-to-outer) aortic diameter was measured. Characteristics of siblings with and without AAAs were compared.\nThe mean age of the screened siblings was 66.4 years (standard deviation, 7.1). Of the siblings, 11% were found to have an AAA, 17% (n = 11) of the brothers, and 6% (n = 5) of the sisters. Only 11% of the siblings were screened for AAAs before the study. One of 16 siblings with AAAs was <65 years. Ever smoking was evident in 81% of the AAA siblings compared to 59% in the non-AAA siblings. Factors associated with increased risk of AAAs in the multivariate regression analysis were: male sex (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-10.8; P = .04) and age >65 (odds ratio, 10.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-86.4; P = .03). Ever smoking was not statistically significant as a risk.\nA strikingly high prevalence of AAAs in siblings was found as compared to the reported declining aneurysm prevalence in elderly men in the Western world. Systematic improvements regarding screening of first-degree relatives is mandated and selective screening of siblings is an underused tool to prevent death from aneurysm disease, both among men and women.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the efficacy of antibiotic-loaded polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) beads in the treatment of lower extremity vascular surgical site infections (VSSIs).\nThis was a retrospective review of all patients with a VSSI of a lower extremity bypass treated with antibiotic-loaded PMMA beads and culture-specific antibiotics during a 4.5-year period. Data collected included patient demographics, comorbidities, site of initial graft infection, symptoms and signs at presentation, initial and additional surgical debridement, wound culture results, type of antibiotic beads implanted, and graft treatment strategy, comprising conduit preservation or in situ replacement, with associated soft tissue management by muscle flap or vacuum-assisted closure. Primary outcome measures included death, recurrent infection, and limb salvage.\nForty patients developed 42 extracavitary lower extremity VSSIs (bilateral groin infections in two). Patients were treated according to our treatment algorithm with antibiotic-impregnated PMMA beads. Previous reconstructions included nine aortofemoral bypasses (groin infection only), 20 infrainguinal bypasses, five extra-anatomic bypasses, five femoral interpositions, two combined inflow-outflow bypass procedures, and one patch angioplasty with VSSI. Cultures isolated 59 pathogens (39 gram-positive, 18 gram-negative, 2 Candida spp). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from 10 VSSs (23.8%) overall and from 27.7% of those patients with attempted graft preservation or in situ reconstructions. Two patients (4.8%) had no growth despite clinical signs of infection. Repeat VSS exploration and culture results led to an average of 1.4 bead replacements before definitive treatment. Final treatment strategy included graft preservation of patent bypasses in 28, partial graft excision with in situ replacement in eight, graft removal only with residual graft remaining at implant site (ie, incorporated anastomotic conduit, 11.9%) in five, and extra-anatomic reconstruction in one. Sartorius muscle flap was performed in 14 groin infections (37.8%). The 30-day mortality was 0%, and limb loss was 7.1% (n = 3). At the median follow-up of 17 months, the limb loss was 21.4% and the recurrent infection rate was 19.4% (seven of 36) in those with attempted graft preservation or in situ replacement.\nAntibiotic-loaded PMMA beads may serve as an adjunct in the management of VSSIs and may also expand treatment options for graft preservation or in situ reconstruction, with expected recurrent infection rate approaching 20%. Further experience with this adjunct may help elucidate its role in the management of this complicated problem, including the need for bead exchanges, until perigraft cultures are free of microbes.",

Previous reconstructions included nine aortofemoral bypasses (groin infection only), 20 infrainguinal bypasses, five extra-anatomic bypasses, five femoral interpositions, two combined inflow-outflow bypass procedures, and one patch angioplasty with VSSI. Cultures isolated 59 pathogens (39 gram-positive, 18 gram-negative, 2 Candida spp). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from 10 VSSs (23.8%) overall and from 27.7% of those patients with attempted graft preservation or in situ reconstructions. Two patients (4.8%) had no growth despite clinical signs of infection. Repeat VSS exploration and culture results led to an average of 1.4 bead replacements before definitive treatment. Final treatment strategy included graft preservation of patent bypasses in 28, partial graft excision with in situ replacement in eight, graft removal only with residual graft remaining at implant site (ie, incorporated anastomotic conduit, 11.9%) in five, and extra-anatomic reconstruction in one. Sartorius muscle flap was performed in 14 groin infections (37.8%). The 30-day mortality was 0%, and limb loss was 7.1% (n = 3). At the median follow-up of 17 months, the limb loss was 21.4% and the recurrent infection rate was 19.4% (seven of 36) in those with attempted graft preservation or in situ replacement.",

    "abstract": "There is widespread evidence that cancer confers an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). This risk is thought to vary among different cancer types. The purpose of this study is to better define the incidence of thrombotic complications among patients undergoing surgical treatment for a spectrum of prevalent cancer diagnoses in contemporary practice.\nAll patients undergoing one of 11 cancer surgical operations (breast resection, hysterectomy, prostatectomy, colectomy, gastrectomy, lung resection, hepatectomy, pancreatectomy, cystectomy, esophagectomy, and nephrectomy) were identified by Current Procedural Terminology and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2007-2009). The study endpoints were DVT, pulmonary embolism (PE), and overall postoperative venous thromboembolic events (VTE) within 1 month of the index procedure. Multivariate logistic regression was utilized to calculate adjusted odds ratios for each endpoint.\nOver the study interval, 43,808 of the selected cancer operations were performed. The incidence of DVT, PE, and total VTE within 1 month following surgery varied widely across a spectrum of cancer diagnoses, ranging from 0.19%, 0.12%, and 0.28% for breast resection to 6.1%, 2.4%, and 7.3%, respectively, for esophagectomy. Compared with breast cancer, the incidence of VTE ranged from a 1.31-fold increase in VTE associated with gastrectomy (95% confidence interval, 0.73-2.37; P = .4) to a 2.68-fold increase associated with hysterectomy (95% confidence interval, 1.43-5.01; P = .002). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that inpatient status, steroid use, advanced age (\u226560 years), morbid obesity (body mass index \u226535), blood transfusion, reintubation, cardiac arrest, postoperative infectious complications, and prolonged hospitalization were independently associated with increased risk of VTE.\nThe incidence of VTE and thromboembolic complications associated with cancer surgery varies substantially. These findings suggest that both tumor type and resection magnitude may impact VTE risk. Accordingly, such data support diagnosis and procedural-specific guidelines for perioperative VTE prophylaxis and can be used to anticipate the risk of potentially preventable morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Cold storage is used to preserve tissue for later transplantation. There is particular interest in prolonging cold storage time for transplantation purposes. To date, the mechanisms that contribute to vascular dysfunction in response to cold storage are poorly understood. The present study aims to characterize cold storage injury of blood vessels on functional and molecular levels.\nTo assess vessel function of mouse aorta, isometric force measurements were performed in a Mulvany myograph after cold storage at 4\u00b0C for various intervals. Morphologic changes were judged by histologic analysis of aortic cross-sections. To characterize cold storage-induced alterations on RNA levels, microarray analysis with subsequent polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed.\nCold storage for 2 days revealed significant impairment of vessel function with respect to potassium-induced vessel tone development and acetylcholine-induced vessel relaxation. Detailed analysis of acetylcholine-mediated vascular response using specific pharmacologic blockers revealed that calcium-activated potassium channels seem to be impaired after 2 days of cold storage. At this point, no severe histologic changes (eg, elastic fiber disruption) were visible. RNA expression of 24 genes was significantly changed due to cold storage even after 2 hours. These include genes associated with vessel tone development (prostaglandin E(3) receptor), cardiovascular function (adiponectin), electron transport chain (uncoupling protein 1), or calcium signaling (protein kinase A regulatory subunit 2b).\nLong-term cold storage impairs vascular function, especially with respect to potassium signaling by calcium-dependent potassium channels. Microarray analysis confirmed impairment of pathways that are involved in calcium signaling and vascular function. Furthermore, various genes were significantly altered even after 2 hours, significantly before functional impairment was observed.",

    "abstract": "Medical management of type B aortic dissection can result in progressive dilation of the false lumen and poor long-term outcome. Recent studies using models of aortic dissection have suggested flow characteristics, such as stroke volume, velocity, and helicity, are related to aortic expansion. The aim of this study was to assess whether four-dimensional phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (4D PC-MRI) can accurately visualize and quantify flow characteristics in patients with aortic dissection and whether these features are related to the rate of aortic expansion.\nTwelve consecutive patients with medically treated type B thoracic aortic dissection underwent a three-dimensional (3D) MRI anatomy scan using a blood pool contrast agent. Two-dimensional phase contrast MRI data (2D PC-MRI) were acquired in the ascending and descending aorta and 4D PC-MRI data were acquired in the entire thoracic aorta. The 2D PC-MRI measurements were used to assess the quality of the 4D PC-MRI velocity data. Stroke volume, velocity, and the direction of flow were calculated using 4D PC-MRI and related to the rate of aortic expansion measured on contrast-enhanced computed tomography.\nComparison of 2D PC-MRI and 4D PC-MRI measurements showed good correlation (Pearson R(2) = 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9818-0.9953; P < .0001) and no proportional bias (bias = 1.0 mL; standard deviation, 4.6). The median aortic growth rate was 6.1 mm/y (interquartile range [IQR], 1.1-15.1 mm/y), and this correlated well with the growth rate of the false lumen (Spearman \u03c1 = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.06-0.89; P = .0347). False lumen thrombosis (FLT) was seen in 7 of 12 patients and was not associated with reduced aortic expansion rate (FLT present: 11.4 mm/y; IQR, 3.6-21.4) vs FLT absent: 9.9 mm/y; IQR, 3.4-24.2; Mann-Whitney P = .8763). False lumen stroke volume and velocity were associated with more rapid aortic expansion (\u03c1 = 0.80 [95% CI, 0.39-0.94; P = .0029] and \u03c1 = 0.59 [95% CI, 0.09-0.87; P = .0480] respectively). The position of the dominant entry tear was associated with rapid expansion, which tended to be higher with distal vs proximal entry tears (distal, 21.4 mm/y [IQR, 11.4-48.9] vs proximal, 5.5 mm/y [IQR, 3.4-16.6]; Mann-Whitney P = .096). Helical flow was seen in the false lumen in 8 of 12 patients and was related to the rate of aortic expansion (\u03c1 = 0.83, P = .0154).\n4D PC-MRI can be accurately applied to visualize and quantify flow characteristics in patients with aortic dissection. Stroke volume, velocity, distal dominant entry tears, and helical flow are related to the rate of aortic expansion. This study demonstrates the potential of this new imaging method. A larger prospective study is now required to measure flow characteristics and determine their predictive value for risk stratification of patients with aortic dissection.",

    "abstract": "Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a widely accepted alternative to high ligation with proximal stripping of the great saphenous vein (GSV) in the treatment of lower extremity venous insufficiency. This study compared short-term outcomes of two generations of (VNUS Closure) RFA catheters, ClosurePlus (CP) and ClosureFast (CF).\nFrom February 2005 to April 2009, a total of 667 consecutive office-based RFA procedures were performed in our institution. CP catheters were used in the initial 312 lower extremity cases and CF catheters in the 355 cases that followed. The technique used for both catheters were as per the manufacturer's recommendations. Postoperative duplex scans were completed to document the following endpoints: GSV obliteration; incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT); superficial venous thrombosis (SVT); and presence of loose or floating thrombus proximal to the treated GSV segment.\nOf the 667 cases, 98% had available duplex scan studies within 1 week from completion of the procedure. Complete obliteration of the GSV on duplex scan studies was noted in 98% of 343 cases using the CF catheter and 88% of 312 cases using the CP catheter (P < .001). No case of DVT was detected in those treated with the CF catheter, whereas DVT occurred in 3.5% of cases treated with the CP catheter (P < .001). Incidence of SVT was 10% and 15%, respectively, for CF and CP (P < .08). Loose thrombus proximal to the GSV was identified in 7% of cases using CF and 6% of cases using CP (P = .80). No embolic episodes were observed clinically.\nCF catheters are superior to CP catheters in terms of GSV obliteration and nonincidence of postoperative DVT. The absence of DVT may likely be due to the commencement of ablation at 2 cm from the GSV-common femoral vein junction.",

    "abstract": "Flow patterns and shear forces in native coronary arteries are more protective against neointimal hyperplasia than those in femoral arteries. Yet, the caliber mismatch with their target arteries makes coronary artery bypass grafts more likely to encounter intimal hyperplasia than their infrainguinal counterparts due to the resultant slow flow velocity and decreased wall stress. To allow a site-specific, flow-related comparison of remodeling behavior, saphenous vein bypass grafts were simultaneously implanted in femoral and coronary positions.\nSaphenous vein grafts were concomitantly implanted as coronary and femoral bypass grafts using a senescent nonhuman primate model. Duplex ultrasound-based blood flow velocity profiles and vein graft and target artery dimensions were correlated with dimensional and histomorphologic graft remodeling in large, senescent Chacma baboons (n = 8; 28.1 \u00b1 4.9 kg) during a 24-week period.\nAt implantation, the cross-sectional quotient (Q(c)) between target arteries and vein grafts was 0.62 \u00b1 0.10 for femoral grafts vs 0.17 \u00b1 0.06 for coronary grafts, resulting in a dimensional graft-to-artery mismatch 3.6 times higher (P < .0001) in coronary grafts. Together with different velocity profiles, these site-specific dimensional discrepancies resulted in a 57.9% \u00b1 19.4% lower maximum flow velocity (P = .0048), 48.1% \u00b1 23.6% lower maximal cycling wall shear stress (P = .012), and 62.2% \u00b1 21.2% lower mean velocity (P = .007) in coronary grafts. After 24 weeks, the luminal diameter of all coronary grafts had contracted by 63%, from an inner diameter of 4.49 \u00b1 0.60 to 1.68 \u00b1 0.63 mm (P < .0001; subintimal diameter: -41.5%; P = .002), whereas 57% of the femoral interposition grafts had dilated by 31%, from 4.21 \u00b1 0.25 to 5.53 \u00b1 1.30 mm (P = .020). Neointimal tissue was 2.3 times thicker in coronary than in femoral grafts (561 \u00b1 73 vs 240 \u00b1 149 \u03bcm; P = .001). Overall, the luminal area of coronary grafts was an average of 4.1 times smaller than that of femoral grafts.\nAlthough coronary and infrainguinal bypass surgery uses saphenous veins as conduits, they undergo significantly different remodeling processes in these two anatomic positions.",

    "abstract": "This study reviews the results of en bloc resection of the inferior vena cava (IVC) for malignant tumor excision and reconstruction.\nA prospective database was reviewed. IVC resection was categorized as suprarenal, perirenal, infrarenal, or extensive (>one segment resected). Repairs were divided into primary, patch, or circumferential. Tumor type, perioperative morbidity, mortality, and graft patency were recorded.\nBetween 1990 and 2011, 47 patients (21 women; mean age, 56; range, 35-89 years) underwent IVC resection for en bloc tumor excision. Sarcomas were most common (36 [77%]: 30 primary IVC). Eleven patients had primary IVC repair, nine patch repair (two autogenous), and 27 had circumferential replacement with a polytetrafluoroethylene ringed graft. Extensive IVC reconstruction in 18 patients included the entire IVC, with renal (RV) and hepatic vein reimplantation in eight; suprarenal and perirenal in six (seven RVs reimplanted); and infrarenal and perirenal in four (four RVs reimplanted). Nine single-segment IVC replacements were infrarenal. Morbidity was 10.6%: one each with bowel obstruction, chyle leak, renal failure with complete recovery (left RV reimplant, right nephrectomy), reoperation for bleeding, and IVC graft thrombosis. Morbidity did not differ by type of reconstruction. There was no mortality. Follow-up ranged from 1.5 to 216 months (18 years) with a mean of 3.5 years. Computed tomography or duplex scans were available in 28 of 47 patients and in 15 of 27 patients in group 3 at a mean follow-up of 36 and 20 months, respectively. One IVC graft thrombosis was documented at 10 months after chemotherapy/sepsis. Tumor recurrence caused three graft stenoses. Cumulative 5-year patency in group 3 was 80% (imaging) and 92% (clinical). Lower extremity edema was universally avoided. Cumulative 5-year survival for the series was 45% \u00b1 8.5%. Mean long-term survival was 5.8 \u00b1 0.56 years (range, 4 months-17 years), with a significant difference between primary or patch (mean, 6.5 years) and circumferential or extensive repair (mean, 4.2 years; P < .005). Cumulative (47% vs 52%) and mean (3.1 vs 3.6 years; P > .12) survival was similar between patients with single-segment and extensive IVC resection and replacement.\nIVC resection and reconstruction for en bloc tumor excision is safe, even when extensive repairs are necessary. Replacement of the IVC with prosthetic graft avoids extremity venous complications and likely contributes to quality of survival. Survival depends on tumor behavior and degree of IVC involvement, where primary and patch repair has a better prognosis than circumferential resection.",

    "abstract": "With the passage of the Affordable Care Act, accountable care organizations (ACOs) represent a new paradigm in healthcare payment reform. Designed to limit growth in spending while preserving quality, these organizations aim to incant physicians to lower costs by returning a portion of the savings realized by cost-effective, evidence-based care back to the ACO. In this review, first, we will explore the development of ACOs within the context of prior attempts to control Medicare spending, such as the sustainable growth rate and managed care organizations. Second, we describe the evolution of ACOs, the demonstration projects that established their feasibility, and their current organizational structure. Third, because quality metrics are central to the use and implementation of ACOs, we describe current efforts to design, collect, and interpret quality metrics in vascular surgery. And fourth, because a \"seat at the table\" will be an important key to success for vascular surgeons in these efforts, we discuss how vascular surgeons can participate and lead efforts within ACOs.",

The purpose of this study was to determine current PICC insertion patterns and if any PICC or patient characteristics were associated with venous thrombotic complications.\nAll UE venous duplex scans during a 12-month period were reviewed, selecting patients with isolated SVT or DVT and PICCs placed \u226430 days. All UE PICC procedures during the same period were identified from an electronic medical record query. PICC-associated DVTs, categorized by insertion site, were compared with all first-time UE PICCs to determine the rate of UE DVT and isolated UE SVT. Technical and clinical variables in patients with PICC-associated UE DVT also were compared with 172 patients who received a PICC without developing DVT (univariable and multivariable analysis).\nWe identified 219 isolated UE SVTs and 154 UE DVTs, with 2056 first-time UE PICCs placed during the same period. A PICC was associated with 44 of 219 (20%) isolated UE SVTs and 54 of 154 UE DVTs (35%). The rates of PICC-associated symptomatic UE SVT were 1.9% for basilic, 7.2% for cephalic, and 0% for brachial vein PICCs. The rates of PICC-associated symptomatic UE DVT were 3.1% for basilic, 2.2% for brachial, and 0% for cephalic vein PICCs (\u03c7(2)P < .001). Univariate analysis of technical and patient variables demonstrated that larger PICC diameter, noncephalic insertion, smoking, concurrent malignancy, diabetes, and older age were associated with UE DVT (P < .05). Multivariable analysis showed larger catheter diameter and malignancy were the only variables associated with UE DVT (P < .05).\nThe incidence of symptomatic PICC-associated UE DVT is low, but given the number of PICCs placed each year, they account for up to 35% of all diagnosed UE DVTs. Larger-diameter PICCs and malignancy increase the risk for DVT, and further studies are needed to evaluate the optimal vein of first choice for PICC insertion.",

    "abstract": "Duplex velocity criteria (DVC) to identify in-stent celiac artery (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis is not well defined. Only one study has been published which concluded that DVC for native SMA stenosis overestimated stenosis in stented SMAs. The purpose of this study was to analyze DVC in detecting CA/SMA in-stent stenosis (ISS).\nForty-three patients with 62 stents (32 SMAs and 30 CAs), who had concurrent postoperative duplex ultrasound scan and angiograms for significant ISS by DVC were analyzed. A receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was used to determine optimal DVC (peak systolic velocity [PSV], end-diastolic velocity [EDV], and CA or SMA/aortic systolic ratios) for detecting \u226550% and \u226570% ISS. These were compared to duplex velocities obtained from 97 native CAs and 74 native SMAs with \u226550% stenosis done in the same study period.\nThe mean stented celiac PSV (cm/s), EDV, and systolic ratio for \u226550% ISS were 447, 136, and 7.1 vs 379, 104, and 5.2 for \u226550% native stenosis (P = .067, .106, and < .01). The mean stented SMA PSV, EDV, and ratio for \u226550% ISS were 410, 114, and 6.2 vs 405, 76, and 2.0 for \u226550% native stenosis (P = .885, .037, and < .0001). The PSV cutpoints for detecting \u226550% SMA ISS was 325 cm/s (sensitivity 89%, specificity 100%, and overall accuracy 91%) vs 295 cm/s for \u226550% native SMA and for \u226570% SMA ISS was 412 (sensitivity 100%, specificity 95%, and overall accuracy 97%) vs 400 for native stenosis. The PSV cutpoints for \u226550% CA ISS was 274 cm/s (sensitivity 96%, specificity 86%, and overall accuracy 93%) vs 240 cm/s for \u226550% native stenosis and for \u226570% CA ISS was 363 (sensitivity 88%, specificity 92%, and overall accuracy 90%) vs 320 cm/s for native stenosis (sensitivity 80, specificity 89%, and overall accuracy 85%). ROC analysis also showed that both PSVs and EDVs were equal predictors for SMA and CA \u226550% and \u226570% ISS. For \u226550% SMA ISS, the area under the curve (AUC) for PSV equals 0.91, EDV = 0.81, P = .341. For CA, PSV, AUC = 0.99, EDV = 0.88, P = .063.\nThere is a tendency toward higher velocities in stented CA/SMAs in comparison to native arteries. Caution must be exercised in using duplex velocity cutoffs for native CA/SMA stenosis for stented CA/SMA. Further prospective validation studies are needed.",

    "abstract": "The PETTICOAT (Provisional ExTension to Induce COmplete ATtachment) technique may be employed during endovascular treatment of type B aortic dissection (TBD) using self-expandable bare stents distal to the covered stent graft placed over the proximal entry tear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the volume changes of the true (TL) and false lumen (FL) on computed tomography (CT) scans.\nSince 2005, 25 selected patients received endovascular treatment for complicated TBD with the PETTICOAT technique employing the Zenith Dissection Endovascular System (William Cook Europe, Bjaerverskov, Denmark). Indications to the use of the PETTICOAT technique were the evidence of clinical manifest dynamic malperfusion in five cases (20%) and/or radiologic evidence of TL collapse in 20 cases (80%). Five patients were treated within 2 weeks from onset, 13 patients between 2 weeks and 3 months, and seven patients over 3 months after the initial acute event. The volumetric analysis of the changes of TL and FL obtained from CT scan performed before endovascular treatment of TBD, postoperatively and yearly thereafter were analyzed using the OsiriX software v 3.9 (Pixmeo sarl, Bernex, Switzerland).\nInitial clinical (30 days) and midterm clinical success was observed in 21 cases (84%) and in 23 cases (92%), respectively. The volumes of the aortic TL and FL were evaluated at 30 days and midterm follow-up (mean, 38 \u00b1 17 months). The following TL volumes were recorded: baseline 84 \u00b1 29 cm(3), postoperative 167 \u00b1 31 cm(3) (+98%), 1 year 193 \u00b1 46 cm(3) (+131%), and 2 years 216 \u00b1 54 cm(3) (+140%). The following FL volumes were recorded: baseline 332 \u00b1 86 cm(3), postoperative 286 \u00b1 85 cm(3) (-14%), 1 year 233 \u00b1 81 cm(3) (-30%), and 2 years 248 \u00b1 112 cm(3) (-32%). Progressive remodeling of the TL was recorded over time in both thoracic and abdominal segments with shrinkage of the FL mainly in the thoracic segment.\nThese data provide insight into potential therapeutic benefit of the PETTICOAT technique. A significant immediate increase in TL could be achieved with resolution of all cases of dynamic malperfusion and TL collapse. A different behavior of volumes in the thoracic and abdominal segments was observed.",

    "abstract": "Iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is associated with severe postthrombotic morbidity when treated with anticoagulation alone. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), with or without the addition of mechanical techniques, is increasingly recommended for patients with iliofemoral DVT, although its effect on postthrombotic syndrome is not established. This study examined the correlation of residual thrombus with postthrombotic syndrome after catheter-based attempts at thrombus removal in patients with iliofemoral DVT.\nSeventy-one consecutive patients with iliofemoral DVT were treated with CDT. Pretreatment and posttreatment phlebograms were evaluated for quantity of residual thrombus by physicians blinded to clinical patient outcomes. Postthrombotic syndrome was assessed using CEAP and Villalta scores by examiners blinded to phlebographic results. Patients were grouped by the amount of residual thrombus in treated vein segments (group 1, \u226450%; group 2, >50%). Clinical score and postthrombotic outcomes were plotted vs residual thrombus.\nSixty-three of 71 patients completed CEAP and Villalta analyses. Groups 1 and 2 had median CEAP scores of 1 and 4 (P = .025) and mean Villalta scores of 2.21 and 7.13, respectively (P = .011). There was a direct and significant correlation of clinical class of CEAP with residual thrombus (R(2) = .74; P = .004) and a direct linear correlation of Villalta score with residual thrombus (R(2) = .61; P = .0014).\nIn patients with iliofemoral DVT treated with catheter-based techniques of thrombus removal, postthrombotic morbidity is related to residual thrombus. When thrombus clearance was complete, the postthrombotic syndrome was avoided. Residual thrombus is associated with an increasing risk of postthrombotic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The resuscitation of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAAs) has not been well studied, and the potential benefit of autotransfusion (AT) is unknown. The increased use of fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) has been associated with decreased mortality rates in trauma patients and may also improve RAAA survival. We explored the influence of intraoperative AT and FFP resuscitation on mortality rates in massively transfused RAAA patients.\nA single-center review of RAAA patient records from April 1989 to October 2009 was undertaken. Clinical data and outcomes were studied. Operative and anesthesia records were queried for intraoperative transfusion totals. Massive transfusion was defined as \u226510 units of red blood cells (RBCs) inclusive of AT units.\nWe identified 151 RAAA patients, of which 89 (60%) received a massive transfusion and comprised the study population. These 89 patients had an in-hospital mortality rate of 44%. Univariate predictors of mortality included increased age, preoperative hypotension, operative blood loss, and crystalloid, RBCs, and FFP volume. AT was used in 85 patients, with an increased ratio of AT:RBC units associated with survival. Mortality was 34% with AT:packed RBCs (PRBC) \u22651 (high AT) and 55% with AT:PRBC of <1 (low AT; P = .04). On multivariate analysis, age > 74 years (P = .03), lowest preoperative systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mm Hg (P = .06), blood loss >6 liters (P = .06), and low AT (P = .02) independently predicted mortality. The mean RBC:FFP ratio was similar in those that died (2.7) and in those that lived (2.9; P = .66). RBC:FFP \u22642 (high FFP) was present in 38 (43%) patients, with mortality of 49%. RBC:FFP >2 (low FFP) had 40% mortality (P = .39). RBC:FFP ratios decreased over time from 3.6 (years 1989 to 1999) to 2.2 (years 2000 to 2009; P < .001), but more liberal use of FFP was not associated with decreased mortality (47% vs 41%; P = .56). AT:PRBC ratios were stable over time (range, 1.4-1.2; P = .18).\nGreater use of AT but not of FFP was associated with survival in massively transfused RAAA patients. No mortality benefit was seen with increased FFP, but few patients had high FFP transfusion ratios. Further study to identify RAAA patients at risk for massive transfusion should be undertaken and a potentially greater role for AT in RAAA resuscitation investigated.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of endovascular surgery has increased the vascular surgeon's exposure to radiation, raising concern for female vascular trainees and staff of childbearing years. We developed surveys for female trainees, established vascular surgeons, and program directors in vascular surgery to determine current practices with respect to pregnancy and radiation exposure guidelines.\nTwo surveys were conducted to evaluate radiation exposure during pregnancy. A survey of the members of the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery was conducted in an attempt to gather information about existing program and institutional radiation policies and assess the need for standard guidelines. A second survey was given to women in vascular surgery in an effort to obtain opinions among concerned groups regarding establishment of a policy from women who were exposed to radiation during and after completion of vascular training.\nFifty-three of 181 female vascular surgeons (29% response rate) responded to the survey, with the majority (53% [28/53]) pregnant during training or practice. Though 68% of trainees and 82% of faculty performed endovascular procedures during pregnancy, only 42% of trainees and 50% of faculty wore a fetal badge. One trainee (3.7%) had complications during pregnancy that necessitated cessation of fluoroscopic procedures or limiting call. There were four practicing surgeons who had complications during their pregnancy. Of these, one was hospitalized with fetal decelerations secondary to excessive on-call obligations with double leading and heavy endovascular call coverage. The majority of women (>60%) felt supported by the program and that they were treated fairly. Over 90% of female trainees and faculty felt that establishment of guidelines for radiation safety for all vascular surgeons would be beneficial. Many (77%) felt that a policy would aid in the recruitment of talented women into the field. Thirty-two of 99 Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery program directors responded to the survey. Of the 32 program directors that responded (32% response rate), 75% would allow the pregnant trainee flexibility in rotation schedule. Finally, 75% of program directors support development of a national policy, and 81% would incorporate one into their program.\nThere is compelling interest to establish radiation safety guidelines for the pregnant trainee or vascular surgeon. Consideration should be given at the Society leadership level to develop and support radiation safety guidelines for all vascular surgeons.",

Restoration of arterial blood flow was obtained by an endovascular approach, with a primary success rate of 98.4%. Rates were low for in-hospital mortality (3.9%) and amputation (5.1%). Patients who died or required amputation more frequently presented with elevated cTnT \u22650.01 ng/mL (52.2% vs 25.5%, P = .01) and impaired renal function (chronic kidney disease stage 3-5; 60.9% vs 38.1%; P = .04). After controlling for age, sex, C-reactive protein, renal function, presence or absence of coronary artery disease, and traditional vascular risk factors, as well as the interval between symptom onset and revascularization, the relationship between cTnT and a worse in-hospital outcome remained significant (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-8.5; P = .010).\nALI patients frequently have elevated cTnT, which is associated with increased in-hospital mortality and amputation. Even small cTnT elevations predict a markedly increased risk of worse in-hospital outcome; however, the overall mortality and amputation rate in our study was low.",

Patients who died or required amputation more frequently presented with elevated cTnT \u22650.01 ng/mL (52.2% vs 25.5%, P = .01) and impaired renal function (chronic kidney disease stage 3-5; 60.9% vs 38.1%; P = .04). After controlling for age, sex, C-reactive protein, renal function, presence or absence of coronary artery disease, and traditional vascular risk factors, as well as the interval between symptom onset and revascularization, the relationship between cTnT and a worse in-hospital outcome remained significant (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-8.5; P = .010).",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the longitudinal changes in renal volume after renal artery stenting (RAS) to determine if renal mass is preserved by stenting.\nThe study cohort consisted of 38 patients with longitudinal imaging available for renal volume quantification before and after RAS. Renal volume was estimated as (kidney length) \u00d7 (width) \u00d7 (depth/2) based on preoperative renal imaging. For each patient, the clinical response of blood pressure (BP) and renal function to RAS was categorized according to modified American Heart Association guidelines. Changes in renal volume were assessed using paired nonparametric analyses.\nThe cohort was a median age of 69 years (interquartile range [IQR], 60-74 years). A favorable BP response was observed in 11 of 38 patients (28.9%). At a median interval between imaging studies of 21 months (IQR, 13-32 months), ipsilateral renal volume was significantly increased from baseline (146.8 vs 133.8 cm(3);P = .02). This represents a 6.9% relative increase in ipsilateral kidney volume from baseline. A significant negative correlation between preoperative renal volume and the relative change in renal volume postoperatively (r = -0.42; P = .0055) suggests that smaller kidneys experienced the greatest gains in renal volume after stenting. It is noteworthy that the 25 patients with no change in BP or renal function-clinical failures using traditional definitions-experienced a 12% relative increase in ipsilateral renal volume after RAS. Multivariate analysis determined that stable or improved renal volume after stenting was an independent predictor of stable or improved long-term renal function (odds ratio, 0.008; 95% confidence interval, 0.000-0.206; P = .004).\nThese data lend credence to the belief that RAS preserves renal mass in some patients. This benefit of RAS even extends to those patients who would be considered treatment failures by traditional definitions. Patients with stable or increased renal volume after RAS had more stable renal function during long-term follow-up, whereas patients with renal volume loss after stenting were prone to deterioration of renal function.",

    "abstract": "Paclitaxel coating of hemodialysis grafts is effective in suppressing neointimal hyperplasia in the graft and vascular anastomosis sites. However, paclitaxel can have unwanted effects on the surrounding tissues. To reduce such problems, we developed a method to coat the drug only on the luminal surface of the graft, with little loading on the outer surface.\nA peristaltic pump and a double-solvent (water and acetone) system were used to achieve an inner coating of paclitaxel. At the ratio of 90% acetone, paclitaxel was homogeneously coated only on the luminal surface of the graft without changing the physical properties. To determine its effect, grafts were implanted between the common carotid artery and the external jugular vein in pigs using uncoated control grafts (n = 6) and low-dose (n = 6, 0.22 \u03bcg/mm(2)) and high-dose (n = 6, 0.69 \u03bcg/mm(2)) paclitaxel inner-coated grafts. Cross-sections of graft-venous anastomoses were analyzed histomorphometrically 6 weeks after placement to measure the patency rate, percentage of luminal stenosis, and neointimal area.\nNo signs of infection or bacterial contamination were observed in the paclitaxel inner-coated groups. Only one of the six control grafts was patent, but all of the paclitaxel-coated grafts were patent, with little neointima. The mean \u00b1 standard error values of percentage luminal stenosis were 75.7% \u00b1 12.7% (control), 17.5% \u00b1 3.1% (low dose), and 19.7% \u00b1 3.0% (high dose). The values for the neointimal area (in mm(2)) were 8.77 \u00b1 1.66 (control), 3.53 \u00b1 0.73 (lose dose), and 4.24 \u00b1 0.99 (high dose). Compared with the control group, paclitaxel inner-coated vascular grafts significantly suppressed neointimal hyperplasia (low dose, P = .001; high dose, P = .002). Myofibroblast proliferation and migration into the graft interstices confirmed the firm attachment of the implanted graft to the surrounding tissue.\nPaclitaxel coating on the inner luminal surface of vascular grafts was effective in suppressing neointimal hyperplasia, with little inhibition of myofibroblast infiltration within the graft wall.",

    "abstract": "Most reports of femoral-femoral bypass (FFB) were published before the era of endovascular intervention. This study examines the utilization and impact of adjunctive endovascular intervention on FFB in contemporary practice.\nWe reviewed 253 FFB performed in 247 patients between 1984 and 2010. Primary endpoints, including graft patency, primary-assisted patency, limb salvage, and survival, were assessed using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine predictors of primary endpoints.\nThe indication for FFB included claudication (27%; n = 69) and critical limb ischemia (72%; n = 184). Forty-eight patients (19%) were treated urgently for acute ischemia. Mean follow-up was 5.6 \u00b1 5.5 years. Over the study interval, adjunctive iliac percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA)/stent placement increased significantly from 0% to 54% (P trend < .001), while the rate of axillofemoral bypass or no inflow procedure decreased from 100% to 46% (P trend < .001). Despite increased utilization, iliac PTA/stenting was associated with decreased 5-year primary graft patency of 44% compared with 74% for axillofemoral bypass patients and 71% in patients with no adjunctive inflow procedure (P = .004). Patients with inflow iliac PTA/stents also had diminished 5-year assisted primary patency of 61% compared with 85% for axillofemoral bypass patients and 87% in patients without inflow revascularization (P = .002). Adjunctive iliac PTA/stenting did not impact limb salvage or overall survival. Five-year primary patency among claudicants and critical leg ischemia patients was 65% and 68%, respectively.\nThe incidence of iliac PTA/stent placement in conjunction with FFB has increased significantly over time in contemporary practice. Reliance on iliac stent placement for FFB inflow is paradoxically associated with both diminished primary and assisted primary graft patency when compared with historical controls. These findings highlight the importance of patient selection and inflow consideration when performing FFB.",

    "abstract": "Multiple studies have established that patch angioplasty following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) reduces the risk of subsequent stroke and restenosis compared with primary closure. Previous reports have also demonstrated bovine pericardium to be associated with similar rates of postoperative complications and restenosis compared with other patch materials. Due to favorable handling and sonographic properties, bovine pericardium has become increasingly popular as a patch option in recent years. However, the intermediate- and long-term performance of this material remains incompletely defined. Through a retrospective analysis of our carotid endarterectomy experience, we sought to compare the bleeding, infection, and pseudoaneurysm rates with bovine pericardium patch closure to those with Dacron patch and primary closure. In this study, 1331 primary carotid endarterectomies performed in our institution between 1996 and 2008 were grouped according to the method of arteriotomy closure: primary closure (PC) (216, 16.3%), Dacron patch angioplasty (DPA) (642, 48.2%), and bovine pericardial patch angioplasty (BPA) (457, 34.3%). Demographic variable and postoperative outcome measures collected real-time via a designated database manager were assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis.\nMean follow-up for the entire cohort was 46.1 months. There were no statistically significant differences in rates of postoperative wound infection, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm formation, or 30-day stroke or 30-day mortality among the three groups. Combined 30-day stroke and death was significantly lower in the PC cohort (0.5% vs 2.3% DPA vs 2.4% BPA; P = .94, BPA vs DPA; P = .001, BPA vs PC; P = .001, DPA vs PC), while 5-year restenosis after both DPA (2.0% \u00b1 0.6%) and BPA (1.1% \u00b1 0.6%) was significantly lower compared with PC (5.2% \u00b1 1.6%) (P = .03, DPA vs PC; P = .008, BPA vs PC; P = .14, BPA vs DPA). Five-year survival following BPA (77.9% \u00b1 3.6%) was significantly improved compared with PC (66.9% \u00b1 3.5%) and DPA (60.8% \u00b1 2.1%) in univariate analysis (P = .24, DPA vs PC; P = .01, BPA vs PC; P = .03, BPA vs DPA), with statin use (P = .004) and male gender (P = .05) being positive predictors of enhanced survival on multivariate analysis.\nThis single-institution, retrospective review represents the largest reported experience with BPA after CEA to date and is the only report comparing outcomes after BPA to PC or to DPA. Our experience further demonstrates that patch angioplasty is protective against restenosis after CEA compared with PC. Equivalent rates of perioperative bleeding, infection, and pseudoaneurysm formation were seen with each closure strategy in this study.",

    "abstract": "We report a retrospective analysis of our experience in bypass vein graft surgery to lateral tarsal, medial plantar, and lateral plantar arteries for treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI).\nBetween January 1991 and February 2010, we performed 137 inframalleolar bypass graft surgeries; of these, 25 (18%) were conducted using foot branch arteries for distal implant. All patients were treated for CLI and most had extensive infrapopliteal atherosclerotic disease (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus D). Mean follow-up was 46.32 months (range, 0-144 months). Main end points analyzed were cumulative patency, limb salvage, and survival. Statistic analysis of all end points was performed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves.\nThere was a predominance of men (64%), and the group mean age was 66.3 years. Diabetes mellitus was the main associated disease. Eighty percent of ulcers or gangrene were restricted to the midfoot (Rutherford V CLI classification). There was a predominance of short-length grafts using the great saphenous vein as the main conduit (72%). The medial plantar artery was the main outflow artery (52%). Early graft occlusion occurred in four patients (primary failure rate, 16%). Secondary patency at 1 and 3 years was 49% and 36.8%, respectively, and limb salvage was 81.7% and 69%, respectively. Nine major amputations occurred, and 10 other minor amputations were necessary. Survival rate at 3 years was 65.4%, and 67% of patients maintained ambulation. Surgical mortality was 8%. No condition was associated with worse results with regard to secondary patency, limb salvage, or survival.\nLong-term results for developed foot branch bypass demonstrated good results for limb salvage, and it is an acceptable surgery for patients with extensive atherosclerotic disease.",

    "abstract": "The use of fenestrated and branched stent graft technology for paravisceral abdominal aortic aneurysms (PAAA) is on the rise; however, its application is limited in the United States to only a few selected centers. Most PAAAs are currently repaired using an open approach. The objective of this study was to determine which patients are at highest risk with open PAAA repair and might benefit most from endovascular repair using fenestrated or branched stent grafts.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study using data from American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) hospitals. We identified 598 patients (27.5% women) who underwent elective open PAAA repair from the 2007 to 2009 NSQIP, a prospective database maintained at >250 centers. The main outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality.\nThe median patient age was 73 years. The 30-day major morbidity rate was 30.1%, and the mortality rate was 4.5%. Major complications included reintubation (10.0%), sepsis (10.7%), return to operating room (9.2%), new dialysis requirement (5.9%), cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction (4.5%), and stroke (1.2%). Multivariate analyses identified four predictors of postoperative mortality after open PAAA repair: peripheral arterial disease (PAD) requiring revascularization or amputation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anesthesia time, and female sex. PAD and COPD were present in only 5.2% and 20.4% of patients but were associated with a 16.1% and 9.0% mortality rate, respectively. The mortality rate in women was 7.3% vs 3.5% for men (P = .045).\nPAD, COPD, and female sex are major risk factors for postoperative mortality after open PAAA repair. Fenestrated or branched stent graft repair may be a more valuable alternative to open repair for patients with one or more of these characteristics who have suitable access vessels.",

    "abstract": "Lymphaticovenous anastomosis has been used for patients with peripheral lymphedema. However, the efficacy of this procedure is controversial due to a lack of evidence regarding postoperative patency. We sought to determine midterm postoperative patency of lymphaticovenous side-to-end anastomoses (LVSEAs) using indocyanine green fluorescence lymphography.\nThis was a retrospective observational study set in a teaching hospital. Of 107 patients with chronic lymphedema who underwent 472 LVSEAs, 57 (223 anastomoses) consented to fluorescence lymphography and comprised the study cohort. The intervention consisted of a microsurgical LVSEA performed with a suture-stent method. Patients also had preoperative and postoperative complex decongestive physiotherapy. Anastomosis patency was assessed using indocyanine green fluorescence lymphography \u22656 months after surgery. Patency rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. We assessed volume reduction on the operated-on limb and compared this between patients in whom anastomoses were patent and those in whom anastomoses were not obviously patent.\nPatency could be evaluated only at the dorsum of the foot, ankle, and lower leg because the near-infrared rays emitted by the special camera used could not penetrate the deep subcutaneous layer containing collective lymphatics in areas such as the thigh. Several patterns were observed on fluorescence lymphography: straight, radial, and L-shaped. Cumulative patency rates of LVSEAs were 75% at 12 months and 36% at 24 months after surgery. No significant difference in volume change of the affected limb was seen between the 34 patients with patent anastomosis (600 \u00b1 969 mL) and the 24 patients without obvious evidence of patency (420 \u00b1 874 mL).\nAlthough further study is required to determine factors leading to anastomotic obstruction and to optimize the results of microlymphatic surgery, the present LVSEA technique appears promising.",

    "abstract": "Amputation-free survival (AFS), a composite endpoint of mortality and amputation, is the preferred outcome measure in critical limb ischemia (CLI). Given the improvements in systemic management of atherosclerosis and interventional management of limb ischemia over the past 2 decades, we examined whether these outcomes have changed in patients with CLI without revascularization options (no option-critical limb ischemia [NO-CLI]).\nWe reviewed the literature for published 1-year AFS, mortality, and amputation rates from control groups in NO-CLI trials. Summary proportions of events were estimated by conducting a random effects meta-analysis of proportions. To determine whether there had been any change in event rates over time, we performed a random effects meta-regression and a mixed effects logistic regression, both regressed against the variable \"final year of recruitment.\"\nEleven trials consisting of 886 patients satisfied search criteria, 7 of which presented AFS data. Summary proportion of events (95% confidence interval) were 0.551 (0.399 to 0.693) for AFS; 0.198 (0.116 to 0.317) for death; and 0.341 (0.209 to 0.487) for amputation. Regression analyses demonstrated that AFS has risen over time as mortality rates have fallen, and these improvements are statistically significant. The decrease in amputation rates failed to reach statistical significance. The lack of published data precluded a quantitative evaluation of any change in the clinical severity or comorbidities in the NO-CLI population.\nAFS and mortality rates in NO-CLI have improved over the past 2 decades. Due to declining event rates, clinical trials may underestimate treatment effects and thus fail to reach statistical significance unless sample sizes are increased or unless a subgroup with a higher event rate can be identified. Alternatively, comparing outcomes to historical values for quality measurement may overestimate treatment effects. Benchmark values of AFS and morality require periodic review and updating.",

The aneurysm was successfully treated by endovascular repair. A complete shrinking of the aneurysm sac was demonstrated during a few weeks postoperatively.

    "abstract": "To present the clinical experience of consecutive series with use of balloon-expandable and self-expanding chimney endografts (balloon-expandable covered stent group [BECS] vs self-expanding covered stent group [SECS]) in the endovascular treatment of challenging aortic pathologies requiring renal and/or visceral revascularization.\nBetween January 2009 and May 2011, data for 37 high-risk patients from one center and 35 patients from another institution, with pararenal aortic pathologies treated by the chimney endovascular technique, were prospectively collected. The chimney-graft technique is based on the deployment of a covered or bare-metal stent parallel to the aortic endograft, thereby creating a conduit that runs outside the aortic main endograft, and has been proposed to ensure secure proximal fixation extending the sealing zones.\nForty-six consecutive target vessels (43 renal arteries and 3 superior mesenteric arteries) were revascularized by the Advanta (Atrium, Hudson, NH) BECS (1.2 chimneys/patient); in contrast, 81 consecutive target vessels (64 renal arteries, 11 superior mesenteric arteries, and 6 celiac trunks) were revascularized by the Viabahn (Gore, Flagstaff, Ariz) SECS (2.3 chimneys/patient). The success rate for target vessel preservation was 97.8% for the BECS group and 100% for the SECS group in the entire follow up. There was one symptomatic left renal artery occlusion of the BECS group treated by open thrombectomy of the left renal artery and placement of 8-mm Dacron (BBraun, Aesculap AG, Tuttlingen, Germany) iliorenal bypass. Additionally, one patient underwent repeat balloon angioplasty with a 5-mm balloon due to high-grade in-stent stenosis of a 6 \u00d7 59 Advanta stent graft 12 months postoperatively. Overall, one perioperative (and not present in the computed tomography angiography at discharge) type Ia endoleak was detected in the BECS group. In contrast, five perioperative type Ia endoleaks were present in the SECS group; however, only one of them was persistent in the radiological imaging and was treated by proximal extension of a 5-mm cuff, 1 year postoperatively, due to continuous aneurismal sac increase. No patient of any subgroup developed postoperative persistent renal insufficiency with need of hemodialysis. Thirty-day and during the follow-up procedure-related mortality was 0% for both BECS and SECS groups.\nIn summary, midterm results of use of covered chimney stents for pararenal aortic pathologies show safety and feasibility with excellent patency and low incidence of endoleaks.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of a unique composite thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) construct (proximal stent graft and distal bare metal stent) for the treatment of patients with complicated type B aortic dissection (cTBAD).\nIn this prospective, single-arm, multicenter study, patients with cTBAD were treated with an endovascular system consisting of proximal TX2 thoracic stent grafts and distal bare metal dissection stents (Zenith Dissection Endovascular System; Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind). Indications for enrollment were branch vessel malperfusion, impending rupture, aortic diameter \u226540 mm, rapid aortic expansion, and persistent pain or hypertension despite maximum medical therapy. One-year follow-up results, including clinical and radiographic (computerized tomography [CT] and X-ray) evaluation, were available for this report.\nTen centers enrolled 40 patients (70% men; mean age 58 years old) between December 2007 and August 2009. The onset of symptoms was acute (\u226414 days) in 24 patients (60%), subacute (15-30 days) in six patients (15%), and chronic (31-90 days) in 10 patients (25%); the overall mean time from symptom onset to treatment was 20 days (range, 0-78 days). A majority of patients (77.5%; 31 of 40 patients) presented with impending aortic rupture (indicated by periaortic effusion/hematoma) or branch vessel malperfusion. Seven combinations of stent grafts and dissection stents were used, and all devices were successfully deployed and patent. The 30-day mortality rate was 5% (2 of 40); two deaths occurred after 30 days, leading to a 1-year survival rate of 90%. Two deaths, occurring at 11 and 81 days postprocedure, respectively, were secondary to aortic rupture. Morbidity occurring within 30 days included stroke (7.5%), transient ischemic attack (2.5%), paraplegia (2.5%), retrograde progression of dissection (5%), and renal failure (12.5%). Additional morbidity after 30 days included one case of retrograde progression of dissection and one case of renal failure. None of the patients with renal failure became dialysis-dependent. Four patients (10%) underwent secondary interventions within 1 year. Favorable aortic remodeling was observed during the course of follow-up, indicated by an increase in the true lumen size and a concomitant decrease in the false lumen size along the dissected aorta, with completely thrombosed thoracic false lumen observed in 31% of patients at 12 months as compared to 0% at baseline.\nInitial data with a composite TEVAR construct have demonstrated favorable clinical and anatomic results. Continued enrollment and long-term data are needed to assess the overall effectiveness of this treatment strategy.",

    "abstract": "Device-related complications in the thoracic aorta are partly due to the unavoidable proximal angulation and increased flow-related forces. The present study evaluated the incidence, predictors, and outcome of the complication of infolding with the GORE TAG thoracic endoprosthesis (TAG device) to better understand the factors that might help predict these events.\nWe reviewed all complaints reported to W. L. Gore and Associates (Flagstaff, Ariz) related to device infolding after the use of the GORE TAG device on or before December 2008. Events related to device infolding were evaluated. Reporting physicians and local company representatives were contacted, when necessary, to assemble all available imaging, data, and outcomes related to these case reports. When available, computed tomography images were reviewed to confirm aortic landing zone diameters, which were subsequently compared with the implanted device size.\nFrom 1998 through December 2008, device infolding was reported in 139 patients (mean age, 40 \u00b1 17 years; 73.4% men) from 33,289 device implants (reported incidence, 0.4%). Events were noted in implants for trauma (60%), dissection (19%), aneurysm (10%), and other (9%) and unknown (2%) etiologies. In 77 patients with available imaging, the average minimum aortic diameter was 21.4 \u00b1 4.4 mm. The mean device diameter was 28.5 \u00b1 3.5 mm, with an average oversizing of nearly 33%. Of reported patients, 51% were asymptomatic, with the diagnosis being made on routine chest imaging. Time to diagnosis was 76 \u00b1 222 days (median, 9.5 days). Only 16 patients received no intervention after the diagnosis of device infolding, all of whom were asymptomatic. The other 123 patients underwent 135 interventions. Of these, 30 patients (24%) underwent open surgical conversion and complete or partial endograft removal. The other interventions included a variety of endovascular techniques, such as large balloon-expandable stent(s) in 40%, relining with additional endograft(s) in 31%, and repeat ballooning in seven patients. Ten patients died after device infolding, all after one or more attempts to repair the infolded device: five died of symptoms related to the infolding and five secondary to the intervention undertaken to correct the device infolding.\nTAG device infolding appears to be an infrequent event, primarily occurring in young trauma patients secondary to excessive oversizing and severe proximal aortic angulation. However, there clearly exists a need for devices that treat such patients. As a result, future device designs should consider the compression failure mode when being designed in order to help prevent such events.",

    "abstract": "This study compared treatment outcomes of patients with supra-aortic arterial (SAA) occlusive disease due to Takayasu arteritis (TA) treated with bypass surgery or endovascular treatment.\nAll patients diagnosed with TA from September 1994 to November 2010 were identified using the hospital database. This retrospective study included 21 TA patients who underwent endovascular or surgical intervention due to SAA lesions and four patients who were referred from other hospitals after endovascular treatment of SAA lesions. Fifteen arterial lesions in 10 patients were treated with an endovascular technique, and 24 arteries in 15 patients were reconstructed using bypass surgery. We performed endovascular intervention for short (<5 cm) stenotic lesions and bypass surgery for longer occlusive lesions. After surgical or endovascular intervention, anti-inflammatory medication (steroids, methotrexate, or azathioprine, or both) was given to 12 patients (48%) with evidence of disease activity for a mean of 4.4 \u00b1 4.5 months (median, 2.6; range, 1-15 months). We reviewed and compared demographic and clinical features, lesion characteristics, indications for treatment, and treatment results between the bypass surgery and endovascular treatment groups. To evaluate the treatment results, we assessed the patency of reconstructed arteries, recurrent symptoms, and complications associated with treatment.\nDuring the 194-month study period, 9.6% of TA patients with SAA lesions required bypass surgery or endovascular treatment. The typical indication for treatment was brain ischemic symptoms. Two patients were neurologically asymptomatic but had cervical artery occlusion in conjunction with an aortic arch aneurysm or symptomatic aortic regurgitation. During a mean follow-up of 39.4 \u00b1 44.4 months (median, 23.2; range, 0.5-178 months), restenosis (>50%) or occlusion of the reconstructed arteries was observed in eight of 15 arteries (53.3%) in the endovascular treatment group vs three of 24 (12.5%) in the bypass surgery group (P = .01; Fisher exact test). More serious complications, such as intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 2) due to cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome or cardiac tamponade developed in the surgical bypass group. No operative deaths occurred in either group.\nSurgical or endovascular interventions were required in one of 10 TA patients with SAA occlusive lesions. Arteries reconstructed after surgical bypass had superior patency to those reconstructed by endovascular treatment. However, bypass surgery was more likely than endovascular treatment to be accompanied by serious early postoperative complications.",

    "abstract": "Hyperlipidemia increases the level of blood plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) that is responsible for regulating fibrinolysis by inhibiting both urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). While this fibrinolytic pathway is well known, the role of PAI-1 in venous thrombosis (VT) under hyperlipidemic conditions has not been fully established. We sought to determine the effects of PAI-1 in an in vivo hyperlipidemic model of VT.\nC57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice, apolipoprotein E gene-deleted mice (ApoE-/-) having hyperlipidemia, and PAI-1 gene-deleted (PAI-1-/-) mice were used in this study. Inferior vena cava (IVC) ligation below the level of the renal veins was performed to create a stasis VT. Endpoints included measuring acute thrombosis (day 2) and chronic thrombosis (days 6 and 14). At euthanasia, blood samples were collected for plasmin and PAI-1 activity. In addition, the IVC and its thrombus were evaluated for thrombus weight (TW), u-PA activity, and differential leukocyte count while the vein wall only was analyzed for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, and MMP-9.\nCompared to WT at day 2, ApoE-/-mice demonstrated a statistically significant 14% increase in TW (P < .05) and a significant 41% increase in circulating PAI-1 activity (P < .05), while showing a trend of decreased plasmin activity. In addition, TW in ApoE-/-mice was 45% higher than PAI-1-/-mice at day 2 (P < .05), 33% at day 6 (P < .01), and 41% at day 14 (P < .01). ApoE-/-mice exhibited undetectable levels of u-PA in both vein wall and thrombus, compared to WT, at all time points. Also, vein wall MMP-2 was significantly decreased by 64% at day 6 (P < .01) and 58% at day 14 (P < .05). MMP-9 was significantly decreased by 71% at day 2 (P < .01) and 48% at day 6 (P < .01), in ApoE-/-mice compared to WT mice. In addition, in ApoE-/-mice, MCP-1 was significantly decreased by 38% at day 2 (P < .01) and 67% at day 6 (P < .01) vs WT mice. As expected in ApoE mice, following a decrease in MCP-1, monocyte recruitment was significantly decreased at days 6 (P < .01) and 14 (P < .05).\nA significant increase of circulating PAI-1 levels in hyperlipidemic mice correlated with an early increase in TW due to impaired fibrinolysis. The undetectable levels of u-PA in ApoE-/-mice correlated to a decrease in vein wall MMP-2, MMP-9, MCP-1, and a decrease in monocyte recruitment diminishing thrombus resolution.",

    "abstract": "Focal infrarenal aortic occlusive disease requiring treatment is an uncommon condition. Short lesions may be treated endovascularly, while long lesions are traditionally treated by surgery. Advances in endovascular devices, including development of covered stents, may expand endovascular options. This study evaluates the feasibility, safety, and midterm results of primary polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-covered stenting of isolated atherosclerotic lesions of the infrarenal aorta.\nBetween November 2008 and March 2011, 12 patients, aged 59 (42 to 78) years, were treated with a balloon-expandable PTFE-covered stent for a focal infrarenal aortic stenosis (n = 11) or occlusion (n = 1). Indications included disabling claudication (n = 9), rest pain (n = 1), or minor tissue loss (n = 2) Follow-up consisted of clinical examination, ankle-brachial indexes, plain abdominal radiography and duplex ultrasonography.\nEleven procedures were performed percutaneously and one in combination with an endarterectomy of the right common femoral artery. Technical success was 100%, and clinical improvement was achieved in all but one patient, who needed additional femoropopliteal bypass surgery. The median follow-up was 18 months (range 2-30 months). During follow-up, all patients remained asymptomatic and ankle-brachial indexes had normalized. Duplex ultrasonography showed no re-stenosis, and there were no stent fractures on abdominal radiographs.\nThe primary use of PTFE-covered stents is a feasible, effective, and safe treatment for focal atherosclerotic lesions in the infrarenal aorta. Comparative studies with traditional treatment modalities, however, are indicated before considering the use of covered stents as standard treatment.",

    "abstract": "This study clarified whether unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an alternative to contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) for aortoiliac arterial measurement before endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nThe institutional review board approved this prospective study. Twenty patients being considered for EVAR underwent MRI using a steady-state free-precession sequence in a 1.5-T system and contrast-enhanced CT within 4 weeks of each other. Two independent observers reviewed MRI and CT in random order using vessel analysis software and measured seven diameters, four lengths, and the angle of the aortoiliac arteries. The intermodality, interobserver, and intraobserver agreements were assessed for each measurement by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and the Altman-Bland method. Additionally, the observers independently recorded the number of bilateral renal arteries, decided EVAR suitability, and selected the main endograft on each modality.\nIntermodality ICCs for observers A and B showed ranges of 0.83 to 0.99 and 0.70 to 0.98; interobserver ICCs for MRI and CT showed ranges of 0.73 to 0.99 and 0.65 to 0.99; and intraobserver ICCs for MRI and CT showed ranges of 0.59 to 0.99 and 0.59 to 0.99. In intermodality, interobserver, and intraobserver comparisons, mean differences in diameters were included within the range -1 to +1 mm, excluding three of seven diameters on CT in interobserver comparison and one of seven on CT in intraobserver comparison. Mean differences in lengths were included within the range -5 to +5 mm, excluding one of four lengths in observer B in intermodality comparison and one of four on MRI and CT in interobserver comparison. All mean differences in angles were included within the range -5\u00b0 to +5\u00b0. Both observers detected all 40 bilateral main renal arteries on MRI and CT. Of the 13 accessory renal arteries, observers A and B detected four (31%) and nine (69%), respectively, on MRI; in contrast, both observers detected 11 (85%) on CT. The observers independently determined that the same seven patients were suitable for EVAR on MRI and CT. Of the seven selected main endografts, seven and six diameters and five and six lengths agreed exactly between MRI and CT for observers A and B, respectively.\nAlthough contrast-enhanced CT remains the gold standard for preoperative EVAR planning, unenhanced MRI with steady-state free-precession sequence can be an alternative modality for patients with contraindications for CT, such as renal impairment, because the intermodality agreement for preoperative measurements is as good as interobserver and intraobserver agreement.",

    "abstract": "Vascular graft infection is a rare but serious complication of vascular reconstructive surgery. This in vitro study investigated the antimicrobial efficacy of a new, silver-triclosan collagen-coated polyester vascular graft compared with a silver collagen-coated polyester vascular graft alone during the first 24 hours.\nThe antimicrobial efficacy of the investigated vascular grafts was assessed by performing a time-kill kinetic assay following Clinical and Laboratory Institute Standards-approved guidelines M26-A. For the purpose of the experimental study, the ATCC 33591 strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va) was used. All assays were repeated sixfold. Bacterial survival numbers were obtained at 1, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours using a standard plate count procedure. Bactericidal activity was defined as a 3 log(10) reduction factor (logRF), according to the approved guideline M26-A.\nBoth antimicrobial vascular grafts achieved >3 logRF and fulfilled the efficacy criterion for bactericidal activity but performed differently in their speed of antimicrobial action. The silver-triclosan vascular graft achieved 3.37 logRF after 8 hours, and the silver vascular graft showed a 4.19 logRF after 24 hours. The silver-triclosan graft yielded significantly lower colony-forming units/mL counts after 4 hours compared with the silver graft (4.29 \u00d7 10(4) vs 1.03 \u00d7 10(6); P = .031).\nBoth antimicrobial collagen-coated polymer vascular grafts showed bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in vitro. Although the silver-triclosan vascular graft showed a faster antimicrobial efficacy, the silver graft exhibited its antimicrobial properties after 24 hours. Which concept will protect an implanted vascular prosthetic graft better from bacterial contamination and subsequent infection needs to be investigated further in in vivo animal and clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "To determine radiation exposure for members of an endovascular surgery team during imaging procedures by varying technique.\nDigital subtraction angiography imaging of the abdomen and pelvis (Innova 4100; GE, Fairfield, Conn) was performed on cadavers, varying positioning and technique within the usual bounds of clinical practice. Radiation exposure was monitored in real-time with dosimeters (DoseAware; Philips, Andover, Mass) to simulate the position of the operator, assistant, and anesthesiologist. The DoseAware system reports radiation exposure in 1-second intervals. Three to five consecutive data points were collected for each imaging configuration.\nOperator radiation exposure is minimized with detector-to-patient distance <5 cm (2.1 mSv/h) in contrast to 10 to 15 cm (2.8 mSv/h); source-to-image distance of <15 cm (2.3 mSv/h) in contrast to 25 cm (3.3 mSv/h). Increasing image magnification from 0 (2.3 mSv/h) to 3 (0.83 mSv/h) decreases operator exposure by 74%. Increasing linear image collimation from 0 (2.3 mSv/h) to 10 cm (0.30 mSv/h) decreases operator exposure by 87%. The anesthesiologist's radiation exposure is 11% to 49% of the operator's, greatest in the left anterior oblique (LAO) 90 degree projection. The assistant's radiation exposure is 23% to 46% of the operator's. The highest exposure to the operator was noted to be in the LAO 90 degree projection (30.3 mSv/h) and lowest exposure with 10-cm vertical collimation (0.28 mSv/h).\nVarying imaging techniques results in different radiation exposure to members of an endovascular surgery team. Knowledge of the variable intensity of radiation exposure may allow modification of the technique to minimize radiation exposure to the team while providing suitable imaging.",

    "abstract": "The autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the accepted gold standard mode of repeated vascular access for hemodialysis in terms of access longevity, patient morbidity, and health care costs. This review assesses the current evidence supporting the role of various patient and surgeon factors on AVF patency.\nThe literature was searched to identify the current evidence available for patient characteristics, methods of AVF planning, and anatomic factors that may affect patency outcomes after AVF formation. The use of adjuvant medications, surgical techniques, and policies for AVF maintenance are discussed in relation to AVF patency.\nCurrent literature supports patient factors, such as increasing age, presence of diabetes, smoking, peripheral vascular disease, predialysis hypotension, and vessel characteristics, as directly influencing AVF patency. Vessels of small caliber (<2 mm) or demonstrating reduced distensibility are unlikely to create a functional AVF. Current evidence does not support altered patency due to sex or raised body mass index (<35 kg/m(2)). Factors such as early referral for AVF, preoperative ultrasound vessel mapping, use of vascular staples, and intraoperative flow measurements affected AVF patency, but the use of medical adjuvant therapies did not. Programs of surveillance and various needling techniques to maintain patency are not supported by current evidence. Novel techniques of infrared radiotherapy and topical glyceryl trinitrate are possible future strategies to increase AVF patency rates. The limitations of available evidence include a lack of large, randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis data to support current practice.\nThere is a complex interaction of factors that may affect the patency of an individual AVF. These need to be carefully considered when selecting surgical site or technique, adjuvant treatments, and follow-up protocols for AVFs.",

    "abstract": "This study documented with independent neurologic assessment the 30-day and 90-day outcomes in selected patients with severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the acute phase of stroke-in-evolution (SIE).\nFrom January 2003 to December 2010, data from patients who had surgery \u22642 weeks of an SIE with high-grade carotid stenosis were extracted from two prospectively collected databases. Clinical assessment was by the vascular neurologist using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the modified Rankin Scale score. All patients had computed tomography or magnetic resonance brain imaging \u22643 hours of stroke onset. Those eligible received thrombolysis. Duplex ultrasound imaging was initially used for the diagnosis of severe (\u226560%) ICA stenosis, and further assessment was by magnetic resonance or computed tomography angiography, or both. Perioperative medical treatment and operative techniques were standardized. Stroke, death, major cardiac events, and functional outcome were analyzed.\nTwenty-seven patients underwent carotid revascularization in the acute phase of SIE. Fluctuating or progressive neurologic deficit was the presenting pattern in 20 patients and occurred after otherwise successful thrombolytic therapy in the remaining 7 (26%). Median NIHSS score at admission was 8. Median delay to surgery from the index event was 6 days. The mean degree of ICA stenosis was 87%. All patients received antiplatelet and statin therapy during the intervening period. Procedures were conventional CEA with patch angioplasty (polytetrafluoroethylene) in 26 patients (96.3%) and redo interposition bypass grafting in 1 patient. CEA was done under local anesthesia in 23 patients (85.2%), with selective shunting in 3 (13.0%), and under general anesthesia, with systematic shunting in 4. At discharge and at 1 and 3 months, no recurrent stroke or death, and one nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred in this series, with a 100% complete follow-up. At 3 months, all patients had a favorable functional outcome defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of \u22642.\nThis short series demonstrates that CEA in the acute phase of SIE with strict selection criteria and close blood pressure monitoring is safe, even after recent thrombolytic therapy, and is effective in functional outcome at 3 months. Larger series of patients are required to confirm the safety and efficacy of this management.",

Histologic analysis showed a thin neointima with a confluent endothelium and a subendothelial layer of smooth muscle cells on the explanted tissue-engineered vessels.

    "abstract": "As branched/fenestrated endografts expand endovascular options for juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (JAAAs), long-term durability will be compared to that of open JAAA repair, which has not been documented in large contemporary series. The goal of this study was to assess the late clinical and anatomic outcomes after open JAAA repair.\nFrom July 2001 to December 2007, 199 patients underwent open elective JAAA repair, as defined by a need for suprarenal clamping. End points included perioperative and late survival, long-term follow-up of renal function, and freedom from graft-related complications. Factors predictive of survival were determined by multivariate analysis.\nThe mean patient age was 74 years, 71% were men, and 20% had baseline renal insufficiency (Cr >1.5). Thirty-seven renal artery bypasses, for anatomic necessity or ostial stenosis, were performed in 36 patients. Overall 30-day mortality was 2.5%. Four patients (2.0%) required early dialysis; one patient recovered by discharge. Two additional patients progressed to dialysis over long-term follow-up. There was one graft infection involving one limb of a bifurcated graft. Surveillance imaging was obtained in 101 patients (72% of survivors) at a mean follow-up of 41 \u00b1 28 months. Renal artery occlusion occurred in four patients (3% of imaged renal arteries; one native/three grafts). Two patients (2.0%) had aneurysmal degeneration of the aorta either proximal or distal to the repaired segment, but there were no anastomotic pseudoaneurysms. Remote aneurysms were found in 29 patients (29% of imaged patients), 14 of whom had descending thoracic aneurysm or TAAA. Four patients underwent subsequent thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR). Actuarial survival was 74 \u00b1 3.3% at 5 years. Negative predictors of survival included increasing age at the time of operation (relative risk [RR], 1.05; P = .01), steroid use (RR, 2.20; P = .001), and elevated preoperative creatinine (RR, 1.73; P = .02).\nOpen JAAA repair yields excellent long-term anatomic durability and preserves renal function. Perioperative renal insufficiency occurs in 8.5% of patients, but few of them progress to dialysis. Graft-related complications are rare (2% at 40 months); however, axial imaging revealed descending thoracic aneurysms in 14% of imaged patients, making continued surveillance for remote aneurysms prudent. These data provide a benchmark against which fenestrated/branched endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) outcomes can be compared.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging and echo color Doppler (ECD) scan techniques do not accurately assess the cerebral venous return. This generated considerable scientific controversy linked with the diagnosis of a vascular syndrome known as chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) characterized by restricted venous outflow from the brain. The purpose of this study was to assess the cerebral venous return in relation to the change in position by means of a novel cervical plethysmography method.\nThis was a single-center, cross-sectional, blinded case-control study conducted at the Vascular Diseases Center, University of Ferrara, Italy. The study involved 40 healthy controls (HCs; 18 women and 22 men) with a mean age of 41.5 \u00b1 14.4 years, and 44 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS; 25 women and 19 men) with a mean age of 41.0 \u00b1 12.1 years. All participants were previously scanned using ECD sonography, and further subset in HC (CCSVI negative at ECD) and CCSVI groups. Subjects blindly underwent cervical plethysmography, tipping them from the upright (90\u00b0) to supine position (0\u00b0) in a chair. Once the blood volume stabilized, they were returned to the upright position, allowing blood to drain from the neck. We measured venous volume (VV), filling time (FT), filling gradient (FG) required to achieve 90% of VV, residual volume (RV), emptying time (ET), and emptying gradient (EG) required to achieve 90% of emptying volume (EV) where EV = VV - RV, also analyzing the considered parameters by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and principal component mathematical analysis.\nThe rate at which venous blood discharged in the vertical position (EG) was significantly faster in the controls (2.73 mL/second \u00b1 1.63) compared with the patients with CCSVI (1.73 mL/second \u00b1 0.94; P = .001). In addition, respectively, in controls and in patients with CCSVI, the following parameters were highly significantly different: FT 5.81 \u00b1 1.99 seconds vs 4.45 \u00b1 2.16 seconds (P = .003); FG 0.92 \u00b1 0.45 mL/second vs 1.50 \u00b1 0.85 mL/second (P < .001); RV 0.54 \u00b1 1.31 mL vs 1.37 \u00b1 1.34 mL (P = .005); ET 1.84 \u00b1 0.54 seconds vs 2.66 \u00b1 0.95 seconds (P < .001). Mathematical analysis demonstrated a higher variability of the dynamic process of cerebral venous return in CCSVI. Finally, ROC analysis demonstrated a good sensitivity of the proposed test with a percent concordant 83.8, discordant 16.0, tied 0.2 (C = 0.839).\nCerebral venous return characteristics of the patients with CCSVI were markedly different from those of the controls. In addition, our results suggest that cervical plethysmography has great potential as an inexpensive screening device and as a postoperative monitoring tool.",

    "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) in the presence of elevated levels of Smad3, its primary signaling protein, stimulates rat vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and intimal hyperplasia. The mechanism is partly through the nuclear exportation of phosphorylated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. The objective of this study is to clarify the downstream pathways through which Smad3 produces its proliferative effect. Specifically, we evaluated the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in TGF-\u03b2-induced VSMC proliferation.\nCultured rat aortic VSMCs were incubated with TGF-\u03b2 at varying concentrations and times, and phosphorylated ERK was measured by Western blotting. Smad3 was enhanced in VSMCs using an adenovirus expressing Smad3 or inhibited with small interfering RNA (siRNA). For in vivo experiments, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent carotid balloon injury, followed by intraluminal infection with an adenovirus expressing Smad3. Arteries were harvested at 3 days and subjected to immunohistochemistry for Smad3, phospho-ERK MAPK, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen.\nIn cultured VSMCs, TGF-\u03b2 induced activation and phosphorylation of ERK MAPK in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner. Overexpression of the signaling protein Smad3 enhanced TGF-\u03b2-induced activation of ERK MAPK, whereas inhibition of Smad3 with a siRNA blocked ERK MAPK phosphorylation in response to TGF-\u03b2. These data suggest that Smad3 acts as a signaling intermediate between TGF-\u03b2 and ERK MAPK. Inhibition of ERK MAPK activation with PD98059 completely blocked the ability of TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 to stimulate VSMC proliferation, demonstrating the importance of ERK MAPK in this pathway. Immunoprecipitation of phospho-ERK MAPK and blotting with Smad3 revealed a physical association, suggesting that activation of ERK MAPK by Smad3 requires a direct interaction. In an in vivo rat carotid injury model, overexpression of Smad3 resulted in an increase in phosphorylated ERK MAPK as well as increased VSMC proliferation as measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen.\nOur findings demonstrate a mechanism through which TGF-\u03b2 stimulates VSMC proliferation. Although TGF-\u03b2 has been traditionally identified as an inhibitor of proliferation, our data suggest that TGF-\u03b2 enhances VSMC proliferation through a Smad3/ERK MAPK signaling pathway. These findings at least partly explain the mechanism by which TGF-\u03b2 enhances intimal hyperplasia. Knowledge of this pathway provides potential novel targets that may be used to prevent restenosis.",

Overexpression of the signaling protein Smad3 enhanced TGF-\u03b2-induced activation of ERK MAPK, whereas inhibition of Smad3 with a siRNA blocked ERK MAPK phosphorylation in response to TGF-\u03b2. These data suggest that Smad3 acts as a signaling intermediate between TGF-\u03b2 and ERK MAPK. Inhibition of ERK MAPK activation with PD98059 completely blocked the ability of TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 to stimulate VSMC proliferation, demonstrating the importance of ERK MAPK in this pathway. Immunoprecipitation of phospho-ERK MAPK and blotting with Smad3 revealed a physical association, suggesting that activation of ERK MAPK by Smad3 requires a direct interaction. In an in vivo rat carotid injury model, overexpression of Smad3 resulted in an increase in phosphorylated ERK MAPK as well as increased VSMC proliferation as measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the quality and readability of patient information for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) on the World Wide Web, as accessed from the United Kingdom.\nWeb sites returned by a simple Web search using the three largest search engines by market share were objectively and subjectively assessed for quality and readability. The Internet search engines Google, Yahoo!, and Bing were interrogated for the term \"abdominal aortic aneurysm\" and the first 50 hits screened. Organization type and Health on the Net status were recorded. Each unique site containing AAA information was scored for quality using the University of Michigan Consumer Health Web site Evaluation Checklist by two authors, and readability was calculated using the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) score. Subjective content assessment was also undertaken.\nOf 150 hits, 112 were relevant, with 55 unique sites for assessment. Overall, the FRE score was 39 (range, 29-47) and the Michigan score was 36 (range, 25-56), with good interobserver agreement (r(s) = 0.83; P = .01). Michigan and FRE scores were poorly correlated (r(s) = 0.064; P = .6). Sites containing discussion on the merits of endovascular/open repair and the concept of an intervention threshold had the highest Michigan scores (58.5 [50-59.75] vs 28 [13-36.5]; P < .001). Search engine ranking, Health on the Net status, country of origin, and organization type did not affect quality or readability.\nThe current quality and readability of online patient information for AAAs is poor and requires significant improvement. Clinicians treating patients with AAAs should be aware of the limitations of the online \"lay literature.\"",

    "abstract": "Establishing an aneurysm model using simple and easy operative techniques is desirable to develop new endovascular treatment devices such as stent grafts. We developed an aneurysm model using the external iliac arteries (EIAs) of adult Beagles, a relatively large animal that we thought would be easy to handle, using simple and less complicated endovascular procedures. In addition, we evaluated the generated aneurysm model histologically and determined the factors that were necessary for creating more dilated aneurysms.\nExperimental animals consisted of 16 beagles (average weight, 14.0 kg). The animals were divided into four groups (S, E, B+S, and B+E). Eight Beagles were in the S and E groups, without balloon dilation. S group Beagles were injected with normal saline into the right EIA and served as a control group. Elastase was injected into the left EIA of the same Beagles (E group). Eight Beagles were in the B+S and B+E groups with balloon dilation. After balloon dilation, normal saline was injected into right EIA of the B+S group. Elastase was injected into the left EIA of the same Beagles (B+E). After 4 weeks, we measured the EIA diameter using abdominal ultrasound imaging from a body surface. Both sides of the EIA were harvested. We evaluated the dilation rate of the EIA diameter, and histologically, evaluated the disappearance of the internal elastic lamina, degeneration and disappearance of medial smooth muscle and the external elastic lamina, and neointimal thickening.\nInner diameters were dilated more in the B+E group vs the other groups. The B+E group internal elastic lamina had almost disappeared, with significantly more severe degeneration and disappearance of external elastic lamina.\nWe developed a muscular artery aneurysm model using the EIA arteries of adult Beagles and a simple endovascular procedure. Histologically, internal and external elastic lamina degeneration was an important factor to create significantly dilated aneurysms in this muscular artery model.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate our experience with the endovascular treatment of total occlusions of the mesenteric and celiac arteries.\nWe performed a retrospective review of endovascular stenting of 27 nonembolic total occlusions of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and celiac artery (CA) between July 2004 and July 2011 (26 patients, 16 females; mean age, 62 \u00b1 13 years). A variety of demographic, lesion-related and procedure-related variables were evaluated for potential impact of technical success and patency. The follow-up protocol included clinical assessment, and color and spectral Doppler evaluation of the stented vessel(s).\nThe clinical presentation was chronic mesenteric ischemia in 12 patients, acute mesenteric vascular syndromes in 10 patients, foregut ischemia/ischemic pancreatitis in three patients, and prior to endovascular repair of aortic aneurysm in one patient. The treated vessel was SMA in 22 procedures, CA in three, and both SMA and CA in one. Technical success was achieved in 23 of the 27 attempted recanalizations (85%). Three patients who failed the attempt underwent open bypass, and another one underwent retrograde recanalization and stenting of the SMA. Procedure success was only significantly related to patient age <70 years or procedure performance after the year 2006. Notably, the presence of a stump, ostial plaque, extensive vascular calcification, recanalization route (intraluminal vs subintimal), occlusion length, and vessel diameter had no significant impact on procedure success. Traditional duplex criteria proved unreliable in predicting restenosis. Life table analysis of freedom from symptom recurrence showed a primary and assisted rates of 58% and 80% at 1 year, and 33% and 60% at 2 years, respectively. Clinical recurrences developed in six patients (four presented with abdominal angina and weight loss, two presented with abdominal catastrophe). There were six access-related complications and no procedural deaths. Four delayed deaths occurred during follow-up (two cardiac causes, two due to abdominal sepsis).\nEndovascular recanalization of mesenteric artery occlusion is both feasible and successful, provided careful planning is used.",

    "abstract": "Increasing aortic diameter is thought to be an important risk factor for acute type B aortic dissection (ABAD). However, some patients develop ABAD in the absence of aortic dilatation. In this report, we sought to characterize ABAD patients who presented with a descending thoracic aortic diameter <3.5 cm.\nWe categorized 613 ABAD patients enrolled in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection from 1996 to 2009 according to the aortic diameter <3.5 cm (group 1) and \u22653.5 cm (group 2). Demographics, clinical presentation, management, and outcomes of the two groups were compared.\nOverall, 21.2% (n = 130) had an aortic diameter <3.5 cm. Patients in group 1 were younger (60.5 vs 64.0 years; P = .015) and more frequently female (50.8% vs 28.6%; P < .001). They presented more often with diabetes (10.9% vs 5.9%; P = .050), history of catheterization (17.0% vs 6.7%; P = .001), and coronary artery bypass grafting (9.7% vs 3.4%; P = .004). Marfan syndrome was equally distributed in the two groups. The overall in-hospital mortality did not differ between groups 1 and 2 (7.6% vs 10.1%; P = .39).\nAbout one-fifth of patients with ABAD do not present with any aortic dilatation. These patients are more frequently females and younger, when compared with patients with aortic dilatation. This report is an initial investigation to clinically characterize this cohort, and further research is needed to identify risk factors for aortic dissection in the absence of aortic dilatation.",

    "abstract": "The underlying causes of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) remain obscure, although research tools such as the angiotensin II (Ang II) apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mouse model have aided investigations. Longitudinal imaging and determination of biomechanical forces in this small-scale model have been difficult. We hypothesized that high-frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy combined with speckle-tracking analytical strategies can be used to define the role of circumferential mechanical strain in AAA formation in the Ang II/apoE(-/-) mouse model of AAAs. We simultaneously examined dietary perturbations that might impact the biomechanical properties of the aortic wall, hypothesizing that the generalized inflammatory phenotype associated with diet-induced obesity would be associated with accelerated loss of circumferential strain and aneurysmal aortic degeneration.\nReceiving either a 60 kcal% fat Western diet or standard 10 kcal% fat normal chow, Ang II-treated apoE(-/-) mice (n = 34) underwent sequential aortic duplex ultrasound scan imaging (Vevo 2100 System; VisualSonics, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) of their entire aorta. Circumferential strains were calculated using speckle-tracking algorithms and a custom MatLab analysis.\nDecreased strains in all aortic locations after just 3 days of Ang II treatment were observed, and this effect progressed during the 4-week observation period. Anatomic segments along the aorta impacted wall strain (baseline highest in ascending aorta; P < .05), whereas diet did not. At 2 and 4 weeks, there was the largest progressive decrease in strain in the paravisceral/supraceliac aorta (P < .05), which was the segment most likely to be involved in aneurysm formation in this model.\nIn the Ang II/apoE(-/-) aneurysm model, the aorta significantly stiffens (with decreased strain) shortly after Ang II infusion, and this progressively continues through the next 4 weeks. High-fat feeding did not have an impact on wall strain. Delineation of biomechanical factors and AAA morphology via duplex scan and speckle-tracking algorithms in mouse models should accelerate insights into human AAAs.",

    "abstract": "Intraoperative imaging of intravascular thrombi is limited by the inability of visible light to penetrate thick-walled vessels. Near-infrared (NIR) light has relatively high tissue penetration and low autofluorescence and scatter, offering significant advantages. We hypothesized that the development of 700-nm NIR fluorophores for platelet labeling, in conjunction with existing 800-nm NIR fluorophores, would permit simultaneous and separable quantitation of intravascular thrombi and measurement of the antiplatelet effect of drugs.\nWe synthesized a series of lipophilic, cationic, polymethine indocyanine dyes (MHI-86, 94, 106, and 114) that emit at approximately 700 nm. Platelet uptake was optimized in vitro and the bioactivity and blood half-life of labeled platelets was characterized in vitro and in vivo. FeCl(3)-induced injury of the femoral arteries and intravascular thrombus formation was performed in 35-kg Yorkshire pigs. A combination of 700-nm and 800-nm NIR fluorophore-labeled platelets was used in conjunction with the fluorescence-assisted resection and exploration imaging system to image and quantify the antiplatelet effect of cilostazol and acetylsalicylic acid.\nMHI-114 was incorporated at nearly 4.1 \u00d7 10(6) molecules per platelet without affecting platelet function. When infused into pigs, the signal-to-background ratio of MHI-114-labeled platelets exhibited a blood half-life of 16.4 \u00b1 2.2 (mean \u00b1 SEM; n = 3) minute and generated a signal-to-background ratio of 2.5 \u00b1 0.5 (mean \u00b1 SEM; n = 3) at the site of thrombi. Using dual-NIR-labeled platelet populations, cilostazol and acetylsalicylic acid were found to cause a reduction in platelet incorporation into thrombi of 51 \u00b1 2% and 10 \u00b1 1% (mean \u00b1 SEM; n = 3), respectively, relative to vehicle-only treated control thrombi.\nNew platelet-avid 700-nm NIR fluorophores permit simultaneous two-wavelength NIR fluorescence imaging and quantitation of intravascular thrombi in intact vessels approaching the size of humans and can be used to study the antiplatelet effect of drugs.",

    "abstract": "An ultrasound screening program for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in men began in Gloucestershire in 1990 and has been running for 20 years. This report examines the workload and results.\nWe reviewed the screening database for attendance and outcome records from AAA surgery in Gloucestershire and postmortem and death certificate results looking for men who died from ruptured AAAs in the screening cohort. The setting was an AAA screening program in the county of Gloucestershire, UK. Men aged 65 were invited by year of birth to attend for an ultrasound screening for AAAs. Men with an aorta <2.6 cm were reassured and discharged; men with an aorta between 2.6 cm and 5.4 cm were offered follow-up surveillance; men with an aorta >5.4 cm were considered for intervention. We analyzed attendance rates, screening and surveillance outcomes, and intervention rates and outcomes over the 20 years of the study.\nSome 61,982 men were invited, and 52,690 attended for screening (85% attendance). At first scan, 50,130 men (95.14%) had an aortic diameter <2.6 cm in diameter and were reassured and discharged; 148 men (0.28%) had an AAA >5.4 cm in diameter and were referred for possible treatment; 2412 (4.57%) had an aortic diameter between 2.6 and 5.4 cm and entered a program of ultrasound surveillance. The overall mean aortic diameter on initial scan fell from 2.1 cm to 1.7 cm during the study (reduction 0.015 cm/y, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0144-0.0156 cm/y; P < .0001). Some 631 patients with AAAs had intervention treatment with a perioperative mortality rate of 3.9%; during the same interval, 372 AAAs detected incidentally were treated, with a mortality rate of 6.7%. The number of ruptured AAAs treated annually in Gloucestershire fell during the study (\u03c7(2) for trend = 18.31, df = 1; P < .0001).\nScreening reduced the number of ruptured AAAs in Gloucestershire during the 20 years of the program. There has been a significant reduction of men with an abnormal aorta, as the mean aortic diameter of the 65-year-old male has reduced over 20 years.",

    "abstract": "Thermal damage to peripheral nerves is a known complication of endovenous thermal ablation (EVA) of the small saphenous vein (SSV). Therefore, the main objective of this anatomic study was to define a safe zone in the lower leg where EVA of the SSV can be performed safely.\nThe anatomy of the SSV and adjacent nerves was studied in 20 embalmed human specimens. The absolute distances between the SSV and the sural nerve (SN) (closest/nearest branch) were measured over the complete length of the leg (>120 data points per leg), and the presence of the interlaying deep fascia was mapped. The distance between the SSV and the tibial nerve (TN) and the common peroneal nerve was assessed. A new analysis method, computer-assisted surgical anatomy mapping, was used to visualize the gathered data.\nThe distance between the SSV and the SN was highly variable. In the proximal one-third of the lower leg, the distance between the vein and the nerve was <5 mm in 70% of the legs. In 95%, the deep fascia was present between the SSV and the SN. In the distal two-thirds of the lower leg, the distance between the vein and the nerve was <5 mm in 90% of the legs. The deep fascia was present between both structures in 15%. In 19 legs, the SN partially ran beneath the deep fascia. In the saphenopopliteal region, the average shortest distance between the SSV and the TN was 4.4 mm. In 20%, the distance was <1 mm. The average, shortest distance between the SSV and the common peroneal nerve was 14.2 mm. The distance was <1 mm in one leg.\nAt the saphenopopliteal region, the TN is at risk during EVA. In the distal two-thirds of the lower leg, the SN is at risk for (thermal) damage due to the small distance to the SSV and the absence of the deep fascia between both structures. The proximal one-third of the lower leg is the optimal region for EVA of the SSV to avoid nerve damage; the fascia between the SSV and the SN is a natural barrier in this region that could preclude (thermal) damage to the nerve.",

    "abstract": "Although endovascular therapy for complex lesions in the lower limbs has frequently achieved successful recanalization by improvement of techniques and devices, chronic total occlusion in the femoropopliteal arterial segment still remains a challenge for treatment by endovascular therapy. We investigated the efficacy and safety of endovascular therapy for chronic total occlusion in the femoropopliteal arterial segment guided by a hand-carried ultrasound (HCUS) device and supported by a retrograde microcatheter.\nWe attempted endovascular therapy for chronic total occlusion lesions in the femoropopliteal arterial segment using a protocol involving a dual-access procedure using the HCUS device and a retrograde 2.7F microcatheter from January 2008 to June 2010. We evaluated the success rate, complications, and clinical outcomes, including the ankle-brachial index (ABI) and primary and secondary patency.\nSuccess was achieved in 18 of 19 patients (95%), without major complications (only two small hematomas). The HCUS device was useful in reducing the personnel and space requirements, radiation exposure, and the required amount of contrast agent. The retrograde flexible 2.7F microcatheter was also useful in achieving successful recanalization and contributed to reducing puncture-related complications. The ABI was significantly improved, from 0.56 \u00b1 0.12 to 0.81 \u00b1 0.11 at 1 year (P < .01) and this effect remained stable. Primary and secondary patency was 63% and 89%, respectively, at 3 years.\nHCUS-guided and retrograde 2.7F microcatheter-supported endovascular therapy for chronic total occlusion lesions of the femoropopliteal arterial segment can achieve a favorable clinical outcome without major complications.",

    "abstract": "Secondary interventions after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) remain a concern. Most are simple catheter-based procedures, but in some instances, open conversions (OCs) are required and carry a worse outcome. We reviewed our experience to characterize these OCs.\nA retrospective review was conducted of all patients who underwent an OC after a previous EVAR for an aneurysm-related indication from 2001 to 2010. Clinical outcomes are reported.\nData were reviewed for 44 patients (77% men) with a mean age of 74 years (range, 55-90 years). The average time from EVAR to the first OC was 45 months (range, 2-190 months). In six patients (14%), the initial EVAR was at another institution. The endografts used were Ancure in 16, Excluder in 13, AneuRx in eight, Zenith in three, Lifepath in one, Renu in one, and undetermined in two. Twenty-two patients had previously undergone a total of 32 endovascular reinterventions before their index OC. Indications for OC were aneurysm expansion in 28 (64%), rupture in 12 (27%), and infection in four (9%). The endograft was preserved in situ in 10 patients (23%). Explantation was partial in 18 (41%) or complete in 16 (36%). Endograft preservation was used for type II endoleak in all but one patient by selective ligation of the culprit arteries (lumbar in four, inferior mesenteric artery in five, and middle sacral in one). Proximal neck banding was performed in one type Ia endoleak. Overall morbidity was 55%, and mortality was 18%. No deaths occurred in a subgroup of patients who underwent endograft preservation with selective ligation of culprit vessels for type II endoleak. Intraoperative complications included bowel injury in two, bleeding in two, splenectomy in one, and ureteral injury in one. At a mean follow-up of 20 months, two patients underwent additional procedures after the index OC: one after endograft preservation and one after partial explantation. None of the patients who underwent elective OC with endograft preservation required subsequent endograft explantation.\nMost OCs after EVAR are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, except when electively treating an isolated type II endoleak with ligation of branches and preservation of the endograft.",

    "abstract": "Sac shrinkage is a surrogate marker of success after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). We set out to determine if any common cardioprotective medications had a beneficial effect on sac shrinkage.\nThis retrospective observational study took place at Leeds Vascular Institute, a tertiary vascular unit in the Northern United Kingdom. The cohort comprised 149 patients undergoing EVAR between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2008. Medication use was recorded at intervention (verified at study completion in 33 patients), and patients were monitored for 2 years. The main outcome measures were the effect of medication on sac shrinkage as determined by percentage change in maximal idealized cross-sectional area of the aneurysm at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years by linear regression model, in addition to 2-year endoleak and death rates determined by a binary logistic regression model.\nAfter exclusions, 112 patients, who were a median age of 78 years (interquartile range, 78-83 years), remained for analysis. The median Glasgow Aneurysm Score was 85 (interquartile range, 79-92). At 2 years, mortality was 13.4%, endoleak developed in 37.5%, and significant endoleak developed in 14.3%. Patients taking a calcium channel blocker had enhanced sac shrinkage, compared with those not taking a calcium channel blocker, by 6.6% at 6 months (-3.0% to 16.3%, P = .09), 12.3% at 1 year (2.9% to 21.7%, P = .008), and 13.1% at 2 years (0.005% to 26.2%, P = .007) independent of other medication use, graft type, endoleak development, or death.\nEnhanced sac shrinkage occurred after EVAR in patients taking calcium channel blockers. This warrants further study in other centers and at the molecular level.",

    "abstract": "To review the evolution of traumatic thoracic aortic injury (TTAI) treatment at a single institution.\nRetrospective analysis of all patients included in an institutional trauma registry and vascular surgery database who underwent treatment of TTAI between January 1999 and January 2011.\nNinety-one patients (69 males) were treated for TTAI. The mean age was 38.5 years (range, 16-79 years). Forty-one patients underwent open repair (OR) and 50 thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR), 37 with thoracic stent grafts (TSG) alone, 11 with infrarenal aortic extender cuffs (AEC), and two with a combination of TSG and AEC. OR was performed exclusively until 2004; the last one was performed in January 2007. All TTAIs have since been treated with TEVAR. The left subclavian artery (LSA) was fully covered in 10 patients (20%) and partially covered in eight patients, with revascularization in only two cases. The use of AEC and avoidance of LSA coverage increased after 2007. Baseline characteristics and injury severity scores were similar between groups. The mortality rate was higher in the OR group (19.5% vs 6.0%; P = .06), although it did not reach statistical significance. The overall incidence of morbidities was similar between the two groups (42% OR vs 50% TEVAR). Two patients developed paraplegia (4.4%) after OR compared with none after TEVAR. In the TEVAR group, a pseudoaneurysm, an iliac artery thrombosis, and a retroperitoneal hematoma developed in one patient each. Overall, eight patients (16%) developed stent graft-related complications (SRC), with two developing early (within 30 days) complications. All complications were related to poor apposition, requiring 10 reinterventions. Four patients underwent open conversions with no mortality. Nine out of 10 SRCs were associated with the use of thoracic stent graft malapposition. No patient treated with AEC had endoleaks or SRC.\nTEVAR for TTAI has superior survival outcomes and has replaced OR. SRC requiring reintervention is associated with malapposition and the use of TSG. Until TTAI-specific endografts become available, use of AEC may minimize malapposition and reduce reinterventions. Routine overstenting of the LSA is not necessary and may increase SRC.",

    "abstract": "The feasibility of total laparoscopic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair has been well established. In a previous case-control study, we showed that the postoperative courses of total laparoscopic and open AAA repairs were similar. The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term results of these techniques in the same cohort of patients.\nThirty patients with AAAs treated by total laparoscopic repair between July 2003 and December 2004 (group I) were matched in a case-control fashion by morphology and American Society of Anesthesiologists class with 30 patients who underwent open AAA repair between April 1997 and May 2004 (group II). Patients who survived the intervention were followed up during 5 years. Follow-up consisted of physical examination and duplex ultrasonography at 1 month and yearly thereafter. Group I patients had an additional control computed tomography scan within the first 3 months postoperatively.\nFive-year cumulative survival rates were similar (group I: 83% \u00b1 7% vs group II: 79% \u00b1 7%; log-rank test, P = .69). No late aneurysm-related death occurred during the follow-up period. Incisional hernias were more likely to occur in group II patients (group I: 0% vs group II: 15.4%; P = .047). Incidence of postoperative sexual dysfunction was similar in both groups (group I: 22.2% vs group II: 25.0%; P = not significant [NS]). No late reintervention was recorded in group I, whereas 2 patients in group II had incisional hernia repair. At 5 years, no graft sepsis or anastomotic pseudoaneurysm was reported.\nThis study suggests that total laparoscopic AAA repair provides good long-term results, comparable to those of open repair in terms of aneurysm-related mortality and morbidity. It may reduce the incidence of laparotomy-related complications.",

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) remains difficult to diagnose, carries a high rate of complications, and is associated with significant mortality. We evaluated our experience with AMI over the last 2 decades to evaluate changes in management and assess current outcomes.\nData from consecutive patients who underwent arterial revascularization for AMI over a 20-year period (January 1990-January 2010) were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, treatment modalities, and outcomes over the last decade (2000-2010) were compared with those of the preceding decade (1990-1999) previously reported.\nOver the last 2 decades, 93 patients with AMI underwent emergency arterial revascularization. Forty-five patients were treated during the 1990s and 48 during the 2000s. The majority of these patients were transferred from outside facilities. Patient demographics and risk factors were similar between the 2 decades with the exception that the more contemporary patients were significantly older (65.1 \u00b1 14 vs 71.3 \u00b1 14; P = .04). Etiology remained constant between the groups with in situ thrombosis being the most common followed by arterial embolus. The majority of patients were treated with open revascularization. Endovascular therapy alone or as a hybrid procedure was used in 11 total patients, eight of which were treated in the last 10 years. The use of second-look laparotomy was much more liberal in the last decade (80% vs 48%; P = .003) Thirty-day mortality was 27% in the 1990s and 17% during the 2000s (P = 0.28). Major adverse events occurred in 47% of patients with no difference between decades. There was no significant difference in outcomes between open and endovascular revascularization. On univariate analysis, elevated SVS comorbidity score, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease predicted early death, while a history of chronic mesenteric ischemia appeared protective. On multivariate analysis, no factor independently predicted perioperative mortality. Bowel resection and cerebrovascular disease predicted postoperative morbidity, while advanced age and connective tissue disease predicted long-term mortality.\nMorbidity and mortality from AMI continues to be high. Revascularization by endovascular means, although more frequent in the last decade, was still utilized in a minority of patients with severe AMI. Advanced ischemia with bowel infarction at presentation, and markers of generalized atherosclerosis are predictors of poor outcome, while history of chronic mesenteric ischemia is associated with better outcome.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying the symptomatic improvement witnessed as a result of exercise training in intermittent claudication remain unclear. There is no reproducible evidence to support increased limb blood flow resulting from neovascularization. Changes in oxygenation of active muscles as a result of blood redistribution are hypothesized but unproven. This study sought evidence of improved gastrocnemius oxygenation resulting from exercise training.\nThe study recruited 42 individuals with claudication. After an initial control period of exercise advice, participants undertook a 3-month supervised exercise program. Spatially resolved near-infrared spectroscopy monitored calf muscle oxygen saturation (Sto(2)) during exercise and after a period of cuff-induced ischemia. Comparison was made with 14 individuals undergoing angioplasty for calf claudication. Clinical outcomes of claudication distance and maximum walking distance were measured by treadmill assessment.\nSignificant increases occurred in mean [interquartile range] claudication disease (57 [38-78] to 119 [97-142] meters; P = .01) and maximum walking distance (124 [102-147] to 241 [193-265] meters; P = .02) after supervised exercise but not after the control period. No change occurred in resting Sto(2) at any interval. Angioplasty (27% [21-34] to 19% [13-29]; P = .02) but not exercise training (26% [21-32] vs 23% [20-31]; P > .20) resulted in a reduced Sto(2) desaturation in response to submaximal exercise and an increased hyperemic hemoglobin oxygen recovery rate after ischemia (0.48 [0.39-0.55] to 0.63 [0.52-0.69] s(-1); P = .01). However supervised exercise reduced the Sto(2) recovery half-time by 17% (82 [64-101] to 68 [55-89] seconds; P = .02).\nSupervised exercise training is not associated with increased gastrocnemius muscle oxygenation during exercise or increased hyperemic hemoglobin flow after a model of ischemia. This suggests that the symptomatic improvement witnessed is not the result of increased oxygen delivery to the active muscle. The enhanced recovery after exercise training therefore reflects a combination of enhanced metabolic economy and increased oxidative capacity, suggesting that exercise training helps reverse an acquired metabolic myopathy.",

Upper extremity access sites were exhausted, and intrathoracic central veins occluded. Because of diminished quality of the left groin due to scar tissue from previous infected access, inadequate vasculature, and the presence of functional femoral catheter in the right groin with common iliac vein stenosis, we decided to create an arteriovenous graft from the left common iliac artery to the inferior vena cava. Adequate thrill and uneventful postoperative recovery was observed. At 4 months, the patient has been successfully using her graft.",

    "abstract": "The proximal aortic neck is one of the limiting factors for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and represents a crucial factor for success or failure of the procedure. In contrast to open surgery, where a clamp can be placed suprarenally but the repair performed infrarenally, EVAR requires a good infrarenal neck for durable fixation and seal. In a high-risk surgical 79-year-old patient with juxtarenal aortic aneurysm with unsuitable infrarenal neck, a hybrid procedure was chosen: juxtarenal aortic banding and EVAR. The banding allowed a successful EVAR by reshaping the juxtarenal aneurysmal aortic segment, hence converting a previously untreatable anatomy into a treatable one.",

    "abstract": "Despite its presumed effectiveness and clinical use, the physiology of selective visceral perfusion combined with distal aortic perfusion during open thoracoabdominal aortic surgery has not been characterized. Thus, the aim of this study was to establish a translatable model of thoracic aortic-clamping to assess the effect of selective visceral perfusion with added distal aortic perfusion on local intestinal macrohemodynamics and microhemodynamics, intestinal histopathology, and markers of inflammation and intestinal damage.\nA thoracolaparotomy was performed in 15 pigs, and the aorta was exposed, including the origins of celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery. The animals were divided into three cohorts: control (I), thoracic aortic cross-clamping (II), and thoracic aortic cross-clamping with selective visceral perfusion plus distal aortic perfusion using extracorporeal circulation (III). Macrocirculatory and microcirculatory blood flow was assessed by transit time ultrasound volume flow measurements and fluorescent microspheres. Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury was determined by the analysis of perioperative intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (IFABP) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels and correlated with histopathologic changes.\nSevere intestinal tissue injury and an inflammatory response were observed in cohort II compared with cohort III for IL-8 (38.2 vs 3.56 pg/mL; P = .04). The procedure in cohort III resulted in a flow and pressure-associated intestinal hypoperfusion compared with cohort I in the superior mesenteric artery (mean blood pressure, 24.1 \u00b1 10.4 vs 67.2 \u00b1 7.4 mm Hg; P < .0001; mean flow rates: 353.3 \u00b1 133.8 vs 961.7 \u00b1 310.8 mL/min; P < .0001). This was paralleled in cohort III vs cohort I by a significant mucosal injury (IFABP, 713 \u00b1 307.1 vs 170 \u00b1 115.4 pg/mL; P = .014) despite a profound recruitment of intestinal microcirculation (338% \u00b1 206.7% vs 135% \u00b1 123.7%; P = .05).\nThis study reports a novel large-animal model of thoracic aortic cross-clamping that allows the study of visceral perfusion strategies. However, we demonstrated with IL-8 and IFABP measurements that thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgery with selective visceral perfusion and distal aortic perfusion is superior to the clamp-and-sew technique, even though small intestinal tissue damage cannot be completely avoided by selective visceral perfusion and distal aortic perfusion. In any case, this model seems to be a platform to evaluate and optimize measures for gut wall protection.",

    "abstract": "Walking with high-heeled shoes is a common cause of venous complaints such as pain, fatigue, and heavy-feeling legs. The aim of the study was to clarify the influence of high-heeled shoes on the venous return and test the hypothesis that women wearing different styles of high-heeled shoes present an impaired venous return when compared with their values when they are barefoot.\nThirty asymptomatic women (mean age, 26.4 years) wearing appropriately sized shoes were evaluated by air plethysmography (APG), a test that measures changes in air volume on a cuff placed on the calf, while they performed orthostatic flexion and extension foot movements and altered standing up and lying down. The test was repeated in four situations: barefoot (0 cm), medium heels (3.5 cm), stiletto high heels (7 cm), and platform high heels (7 cm). The APG values of venous filling index (VFI), ejection fraction (EF), and residual volume fraction (RVF) were divided into four groups according to heel height and compared by repeated-measures analysis of variance.\nRVF was increased in the groups wearing high heels (stiletto and platform) compared with the barefoot group (P < .05). RVF was increased in the medium-heel group (3.5 cm) compared with the barefoot group (P < .05), and despite the lack of statistical significance, the medium-heel group showed lower values of RVF compared with the two high-heel groups. The EF parameter followed the opposite tendency, showing higher values for the barefoot group compared with the other three groups (P < .05). Values for VFI were similar in the three situations evaluated.\nHigh heels reduce muscle pump function, as demonstrated by reduced EF and increased RVF values. The continuous use of high heels tends to provoke venous hypertension in the lower limbs and may represent a causal factor of venous disease symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Current information regarding coverage of accessory renal arteries (ARAs) during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is based on small case series with limited follow-up. This study evaluates the outcomes of ARA coverage in a large contemporary cohort.\nConsecutive EVAR data from January 2004 to August 2010 were collected in a prospective database at a University Hospital. Patient and aneurysm-related characteristics, imaging studies, and ARA coverage versus preservation were analyzed. Volumetric analysis of three-dimensional reconstruction computed tomography scans was used to assess renal infarction volume extent. Long-term renal function and overall technical success of aneurysm exclusion were compared.\nA cohort of 426 EVARs was identified. ARAs were present in 69 patients with a mean follow-up of 27 months (range, 1 to 60 months). Forty-five ARAs were covered in 40 patients; 29 patients had intentional ARA preservation. Patient and anatomic characteristics were similar between groups except that ARA coverage patients had shorter aneurysm necks (P = .03). Renal infarctions occurred in 84% of kidneys with covered ARAs. There was no significant deterioration in long-term glomerular filtration rate when compared with patients in the control group. No difference in the rate of endoleak, secondary procedures, or the requirement for antihypertensive medications was found.\nThis study is the largest to date with the longest follow-up relating to ARA coverage. Contrary to previous reports, renal infarction after ARA coverage is common. Nevertheless, coverage is well tolerated based upon preservation of renal function without additional morbidity. These results support the long-term safety of ARA coverage for EVAR when necessary.",

Group A and group B not differ statistically in age (72.8 vs 71.1 years), sex (women, 29.4% vs 34.6%), cardiovascular risk factors, body mass index (25.9 vs 26.1 kg/m(2)), bypass anatomy, and runoff. Group A and B had equal operative time (151.4 vs 151.1 minutes), incisional length (39.4 vs 39.9 cm), and secondary bypass patency at 30 days (96.1% vs 96.2%; P = .49). Conduit issues resulted in six intraoperative changes of the operative plan in group B vs none in group A (P = .014). Median postoperative length of stay was comparable in both groups (P = .18). Surgical site infections (SSIs) were classified (in group A vs B) as minor (23.5% vs 23.1%; P = 1.0) and major (1.9% vs 21.2%; P = .004). Readmissions due to SSIs were 3.9% in group A vs 19.2% in group B (P = .028). Two patients in group B died after complications of SSIs. Multivariate analysis identified preoperative DVM as the only significant factor influencing the development of major SSI (P = .0038).\nRoutine DVM should be recommended for infrainguinal bypass surgery. The study found that preoperative DVM significantly avoids unnecessary surgical exploration, development of major SSI, and reduces frequency of readmissions for SSI treatment.",

A 62-year-old man with a right subclavian artery aneurysm had had a history of bird hunting using a shotgun that impacted substantially against his right clavicula and shoulder weekly for >20 years. The patient underwent open repair with partial sternotomy and distal balloon control. The aneurysmal sac was resected, and the right subclavian artery was reconstructed with a primary end-to-end anastomosis. Histopathologic examination of the resected aneurysmal wall revealed that all three layers of the arterial wall were comparatively intact, with fibrosis and lipid deposition in the intima and in various degrees of degeneration in the media, suggesting a true aneurysm.",

    "abstract": "To date, history of a contralateral amputation as a potential predictor of outcomes after lower extremity bypass (LEB) for critical limb ischemia (CLI) has not been studied. We sought to determine if a prior contralateral lower extremity amputation predicts worse outcomes in patients undergoing LEB in the remaining intact limb.\nA retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing infrainguinal LEB for CLI between 2003 and 2010 within hospitals comprising the Vascular Study Group of New England was performed. Patients were stratified according to whether or not they had previously undergone a contralateral major or minor amputation before LEB. Primary end points included major amputation and graft occlusion at 1 year postoperatively. Secondary end points included in-hospital major adverse events, discharge status, and mortality at 1 year.\nOf 2636 LEB procedures, 228 (8.6%) were performed in the setting of a prior contralateral amputation. Patients with a prior amputation compared to those without were younger (66.5 vs 68.7; P = .034), more like to have congestive heart failure (CHF; 25% vs 16%; P = .002), hypertension (94% vs 85%; P = .015), renal insufficiency (26% vs 14%; P = .0002), and hemodialysis-dependent renal failure (14% vs 6%; P = .0002). They were also more likely to be nursing home residents (8.0% vs 3.6%; P = .036), less likely to ambulate without assistance (41% vs 80%; P < .0002), and more likely to have had a prior ipsilateral bypass (20% vs 12%; P = .0005). These patients experience increased in-hospital major adverse events, including myocardial infarction (MI; 8.9% vs 4.2%; P = .002), CHF (6.1% vs 3.4%; P = .044), deterioration in renal function (9.0% vs 4.7%; P = .006), and respiratory complications (4.2% vs 2.3%; P = .034). They were less likely to be discharged home (52% vs 72%; P < .0001) and less likely to be ambulatory on discharge (25% vs 55%; P < .0001). Although patients with a prior contralateral amputation experienced increased rates of graft occlusion (38% vs 17%; P < .0001) and major amputation (16% vs 7%; P < .0001) at 1 year, there was not a significant difference in mortality (16% vs 10%; P = .160). On multivariable analysis, prior contralateral amputation was an independent predictor of both major amputation (odds ratio, 1.73; confidence interval, 1.06-2.83; P = .027) and graft occlusion (odds ratio, 1.93; confidence interval, 1.39-2.68; P < .0001) at 1 year.\nPatients with prior contralateral amputations who present with CLI in the intact limb represent a high-risk population, even among patients with advanced peripheral arterial disease. When considering LEB in this setting, both physicians and patients should expect increased rates of perioperative adverse events, increased rates of 1-year graft occlusion, and decreased rates of limb salvage, when compared with patients who have not undergone a contralateral amputation.",

    "abstract": "Despite multiple studies over more than 3 decades, there still is no consensus about the influence of anesthesia type on postoperative outcomes following carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The objective of this study was to investigate whether anesthesia type, either general anesthesia (GA) or regional anesthesia (RA), independently contributes to the risk of postoperative cardiovascular complications or death using the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database.\nRetrospective analysis of elective cases of CEA from 2005 through 2009 was performed. A propensity score model using 45 covariates, including demographic factors, comorbidities, stroke history, measures of general health, and laboratory values, was used to adjust for bias and to determine the independent influence of anesthesia type on postoperative stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and death.\nOf 26,070 cases listed in the ACS NSQIP database, GA and RA were used in 22,054 (84.6%) and 4016 (15.4%) cases, respectively. Postoperative stroke, MI, and death occurred in 360 (1.63%), 133 (0.6%), and 154 (0.70%) patients of the GA group, respectively, and in 58 (1.44%), 11 (0.27%), and 27 (0.67%) patients of the RA group, respectively. Stratification by propensity score quintile and adjustment for covariates demonstrated GA to be a significant risk factor for postoperative MI with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) of 2.18 (95% CI, 1.17-4.04), P = .01 in the entire study population. The OR for MI was 5.41 (95% CI, 1.32-22.16; P = .019) in the subgroup of patients with preoperative neurologic symptoms, and 1.44 (95% CI, 0.71-2.90; P = .31) in the subgroup of patients without preoperative neurologic symptoms.\nThis analysis of a large, prospectively collected and validated multicenter database indicates that GA for CEA is an independent risk factor for postoperative MI, particularly in patients with preoperative neurologic symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The anticoagulant treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has been historically directed toward the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism. However, such treatment imperfectly protects against late manifestations of the postthrombotic syndrome. By restoring venous patency and preserving valvular function, early thrombus removal strategies can potentially decrease postthrombotic morbidity.\nA committee of experts in venous disease was charged by the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum to develop evidence-based practice guidelines for early thrombus removal strategies, including catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, and surgical thrombectomy.\nEvidence-based recommendations are based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant literature, supplemented when necessary by less rigorous data. Recommendations are made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, incorporating the strength of the recommendation (strong: 1; weak: 2) and an evaluation of the level of the evidence (A to C).\nOn the basis of the best evidence currently available, we recommend against routine use of the term \"proximal venous thrombosis\" in favor of more precise characterization of thrombi as involving the iliofemoral or femoropopliteal venous segments (Grade 1A). We further suggest the use of early thrombus removal strategies in ambulatory patients with good functional capacity and a first episode of iliofemoral DVT of <14 days in duration (Grade 2C) and strongly recommend their use in patients with limb-threatening ischemia due to iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction (Grade 1A). We suggest pharmacomechanical strategies over catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis alone if resources are available and that surgical thrombectomy be considered if thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated (Grade 2C).\nMost data regarding early thrombus removal strategies are of low quality but do suggest patient-important benefits with respect to reducing postthrombotic morbidity. We anticipate revision of these guidelines as additional evidence becomes available.",

We suggest pharmacomechanical strategies over catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis alone if resources are available and that surgical thrombectomy be considered if thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated (Grade 2C).",

    "abstract": "In patients with Marfan syndrome, the complications of aortic degeneration, including dissection, aneurysm, and rupture represent the main cause of mortality. Although contemporary management of ascending aortic disease requires open surgical reconstruction, endovascular repair is now available for management of descending thoracic and abdominal aortic pathology (ie, thoracic endovascular aortic repair [TEVAR], endovascular aneurysm repair [EVAR]). The short- and long-term benefit of endovascular repair in Marfan patients remains largely unproven. We examine our outcomes after EVAR in this patient population.\nAll patients with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome who were treated with TEVAR/EVAR were evaluated in a retrospective review. Perioperative, procedure-specific and patient covariate data were aggregated. Primary endpoints were overall mortality and procedural success as divided into three categories: (1) successful therapy, (2) primary failure, or (3) secondary failure.\nBetween 2000 and June 2010, 16 patients were identified as having undergone 19 TEVAR/EVAR procedures. These included three emergent operations (two for acute dissection/malperfusion and one for anastomotic disruption early after open repair). All 16 patients had previously undergone at least one (range, 1-5) open operation of the ascending aorta or arch at a time interval from 33 years to 1 week prior to the index endovascular repair. During a median follow-up of 9.3 months (range, 0-46 months), there were four deaths (25%). Six patients (38%) had successful endovascular interventions. Despite early success, there was one death in this group at 1 month postintervention. Seven patients (44%) experienced primary treatment failure with five undergoing open conversion and one undergoing left subclavian coil embolization (the seventh was lost to follow-up and presented 4 months later in cardiac arrest and expired without repair). There were three deaths in the primary treatment failure group. Two patients experienced secondary treatment failure. One underwent the index TEVAR for acute dissection with malperfusion and required a subsequent TEVAR for more distal aortic pathology. He is stable without disease progression. The other patient underwent open conversion after a second EVAR with four-vessel \"chimney\" stent grafts and is stable with his entire native aorta having been replaced.\nAortic disease associated with Marfan syndrome is a complex clinical problem and many patients require remedial procedures. Endovascular therapy can provide a useful adjunct or bridge to open surgical treatment in selected patients. However, failure of endovascular therapy is common, and its use should be judicious with close follow-up to avoid delay if open surgical repair is required.",

    "abstract": "There is widespread evidence that cancer confers an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). This risk is thought to vary among different cancer types. The purpose of this study is to better define the incidence of thrombotic complications among patients undergoing surgical treatment for a spectrum of prevalent cancer diagnoses in contemporary practice.\nAll patients undergoing one of 11 cancer surgical operations (breast resection, hysterectomy, prostatectomy, colectomy, gastrectomy, lung resection, hepatectomy, pancreatectomy, cystectomy, esophagectomy, and nephrectomy) were identified by Current Procedural Terminology and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2007-2009). The study endpoints were DVT, pulmonary embolism (PE), and overall postoperative venous thromboembolic events (VTE) within 1 month of the index procedure. Multivariate logistic regression was utilized to calculate adjusted odds ratios for each endpoint.\nOver the study interval, 43,808 of the selected cancer operations were performed. The incidence of DVT, PE, and total VTE within 1 month following surgery varied widely across a spectrum of cancer diagnoses, ranging from 0.19%, 0.12%, and 0.28% for breast resection to 6.1%, 2.4%, and 7.3%, respectively, for esophagectomy. Compared with breast cancer, the incidence of VTE ranged from a 1.31-fold increase in VTE associated with gastrectomy (95% confidence interval, 0.73-2.37; P = .4) to a 2.68-fold increase associated with hysterectomy (95% confidence interval, 1.43-5.01; P = .002). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that inpatient status, steroid use, advanced age (\u226560 years), morbid obesity (body mass index \u226535), blood transfusion, reintubation, cardiac arrest, postoperative infectious complications, and prolonged hospitalization were independently associated with increased risk of VTE.\nThe incidence of VTE and thromboembolic complications associated with cancer surgery varies substantially. These findings suggest that both tumor type and resection magnitude may impact VTE risk. Accordingly, such data support diagnosis and procedural-specific guidelines for perioperative VTE prophylaxis and can be used to anticipate the risk of potentially preventable morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Medical management of type B aortic dissection can result in progressive dilation of the false lumen and poor long-term outcome. Recent studies using models of aortic dissection have suggested flow characteristics, such as stroke volume, velocity, and helicity, are related to aortic expansion. The aim of this study was to assess whether four-dimensional phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (4D PC-MRI) can accurately visualize and quantify flow characteristics in patients with aortic dissection and whether these features are related to the rate of aortic expansion.\nTwelve consecutive patients with medically treated type B thoracic aortic dissection underwent a three-dimensional (3D) MRI anatomy scan using a blood pool contrast agent. Two-dimensional phase contrast MRI data (2D PC-MRI) were acquired in the ascending and descending aorta and 4D PC-MRI data were acquired in the entire thoracic aorta. The 2D PC-MRI measurements were used to assess the quality of the 4D PC-MRI velocity data. Stroke volume, velocity, and the direction of flow were calculated using 4D PC-MRI and related to the rate of aortic expansion measured on contrast-enhanced computed tomography.\nComparison of 2D PC-MRI and 4D PC-MRI measurements showed good correlation (Pearson R(2) = 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9818-0.9953; P < .0001) and no proportional bias (bias = 1.0 mL; standard deviation, 4.6). The median aortic growth rate was 6.1 mm/y (interquartile range [IQR], 1.1-15.1 mm/y), and this correlated well with the growth rate of the false lumen (Spearman \u03c1 = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.06-0.89; P = .0347). False lumen thrombosis (FLT) was seen in 7 of 12 patients and was not associated with reduced aortic expansion rate (FLT present: 11.4 mm/y; IQR, 3.6-21.4) vs FLT absent: 9.9 mm/y; IQR, 3.4-24.2; Mann-Whitney P = .8763). False lumen stroke volume and velocity were associated with more rapid aortic expansion (\u03c1 = 0.80 [95% CI, 0.39-0.94; P = .0029] and \u03c1 = 0.59 [95% CI, 0.09-0.87; P = .0480] respectively). The position of the dominant entry tear was associated with rapid expansion, which tended to be higher with distal vs proximal entry tears (distal, 21.4 mm/y [IQR, 11.4-48.9] vs proximal, 5.5 mm/y [IQR, 3.4-16.6]; Mann-Whitney P = .096). Helical flow was seen in the false lumen in 8 of 12 patients and was related to the rate of aortic expansion (\u03c1 = 0.83, P = .0154).\n4D PC-MRI can be accurately applied to visualize and quantify flow characteristics in patients with aortic dissection. Stroke volume, velocity, distal dominant entry tears, and helical flow are related to the rate of aortic expansion. This study demonstrates the potential of this new imaging method. A larger prospective study is now required to measure flow characteristics and determine their predictive value for risk stratification of patients with aortic dissection.",

    "abstract": "Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a widely accepted alternative to high ligation with proximal stripping of the great saphenous vein (GSV) in the treatment of lower extremity venous insufficiency. This study compared short-term outcomes of two generations of (VNUS Closure) RFA catheters, ClosurePlus (CP) and ClosureFast (CF).\nFrom February 2005 to April 2009, a total of 667 consecutive office-based RFA procedures were performed in our institution. CP catheters were used in the initial 312 lower extremity cases and CF catheters in the 355 cases that followed. The technique used for both catheters were as per the manufacturer's recommendations. Postoperative duplex scans were completed to document the following endpoints: GSV obliteration; incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT); superficial venous thrombosis (SVT); and presence of loose or floating thrombus proximal to the treated GSV segment.\nOf the 667 cases, 98% had available duplex scan studies within 1 week from completion of the procedure. Complete obliteration of the GSV on duplex scan studies was noted in 98% of 343 cases using the CF catheter and 88% of 312 cases using the CP catheter (P < .001). No case of DVT was detected in those treated with the CF catheter, whereas DVT occurred in 3.5% of cases treated with the CP catheter (P < .001). Incidence of SVT was 10% and 15%, respectively, for CF and CP (P < .08). Loose thrombus proximal to the GSV was identified in 7% of cases using CF and 6% of cases using CP (P = .80). No embolic episodes were observed clinically.\nCF catheters are superior to CP catheters in terms of GSV obliteration and nonincidence of postoperative DVT. The absence of DVT may likely be due to the commencement of ablation at 2 cm from the GSV-common femoral vein junction.",

Computed tomography was used to measure calf muscle characteristics at baseline and every 2 years. Knee extension isometric strength, power, and 6-minute walk distance were measured at baseline and annually. Baseline BMI (kg/m(2)) categories were ideal (20-25), overweight (>25-30), and obese (>30). Analyses adjust for age, race, sex, ankle brachial index, comorbidities, and other covariates.\nAt baseline, higher BMI among participants with PAD was associated with greater calf muscle area (ideal BMI: 5181 mm(2); overweight: 5513 mm(2); obese: 5695 mm(2); P = .0009 for trend), higher calf muscle percentage of fat (6.38%, 10.28%, 17.44%, respectively, P < .0001 for trend), lower calf muscle density (P < .0001 for trend), and higher isometric knee extension strength (P = .015 for trend). Among participants with PAD, higher BMI was associated with greater declines in calf muscle area (P = .030 for trend) and greater increases in calf muscle percentage of fat (P = .023 for trend). Among participants without PAD, there were no significant associations of baseline BMI with changes in lower extremity muscle outcomes over time.\nAmong PAD participants, higher BMI is associated with greater calf muscle area at baseline. However, higher BMI is associated with more adverse calf muscle density and calf muscle percentage of fat at baseline and greater declines in calf muscle area over time.",

    "abstract": "Single-segment great saphenous vein (SSGSV) remains the conduit of choice for femoral to below-knee popliteal (F-BK) surgical revascularization. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal conduit in patients with inadequate SSGSV.\nThis was a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained vascular registry. Patients underwent F-BK bypass with alternative vein (AV; arm vein, spliced GSV, or composite vein) or prosthetic conduit (PC).\nFrom January 1995 to June 2010, 83 patients had unusable SSGSV for F-BK popliteal reconstruction. Thirty-three patients had an AV conduit and 50 had PC. The AV group was a lower median age than the PC group (69 vs 75 years). The two groups were otherwise similar in comorbid conditions of diabetes mellitus (57.6% vs 58.0%; P > .99), smoking (15.2% vs 32.0%; P = .12), and hemodialysis (3% vs 12%; P = .23). The groups were similar in baseline characteristics such as limb salvage as indication (93.9% vs 86.0%; P = .31), mean runoff score (5.2 vs 4.6; P = .39), and prior ipsilateral bypass attempts (18.2% vs 18.0%; P > .99). The AV and PC groups were also similar in 30-day mortality (6.1% vs 4.0%; P > .99) and wound infection rates (6.1% vs 6.0%; P > .99). PC patients were more likely to be discharged on Coumadin (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ) than AV patients (62.0% vs 27.3%; P = .002). Seventeen of the 50 PC patients (34%) had a distal anastomotic vein cuff. A log-rank test comparison of 5-year outcomes for the AV and PC groups found no significant difference in primary patency (55.3% \u00b1 9.9% vs 51.9% \u00b1 10.8%; P = .82), assisted primary patency (68.8% \u00b1 9.6% vs 54.0% \u00b1 11.0%; P = .45), secondary patency (68.4% \u00b1 9.6% vs 63.7% \u00b1 10.4% for PC; P = .82), or limb salvage rates (96.2% \u00b1 3.8% vs 81.1% \u00b1 8.1%; P = .19). Multivariable analysis demonstrated no association between conduit type and loss of patency or limb. The factors most predictive of primary patency loss were limb salvage as the indication for surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 4.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-10.9; P = .003) and current hemodialysis (HR, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.08-11.4; P = .037). The most predictive factor of limb loss was current hemodialysis (HR, 7.02; 95% CI, 1.13-43.4; P = .036).\nFor patients with inadequate SSGSV, PCs, with varying degrees of medical and surgical adjuncts, appear comparable to AV sources in graft patency for below-knee popliteal bypass targets. This observation is tempered by the small cohort sample size of this single-institutional analysis. Critical limb ischemia as the operative indication and current hemodialysis predict impaired patency, and hemodialysis is associated with limb loss.",

The groups were similar in baseline characteristics such as limb salvage as indication (93.9% vs 86.0%; P = .31), mean runoff score (5.2 vs 4.6; P = .39), and prior ipsilateral bypass attempts (18.2% vs 18.0%; P > .99). The AV and PC groups were also similar in 30-day mortality (6.1% vs 4.0%; P > .99) and wound infection rates (6.1% vs 6.0%; P > .99). PC patients were more likely to be discharged on Coumadin (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ) than AV patients (62.0% vs 27.3%; P = .002). Seventeen of the 50 PC patients (34%) had a distal anastomotic vein cuff. A log-rank test comparison of 5-year outcomes for the AV and PC groups found no significant difference in primary patency (55.3% \u00b1 9.9% vs 51.9% \u00b1 10.8%; P = .82), assisted primary patency (68.8% \u00b1 9.6% vs 54.0% \u00b1 11.0%; P = .45), secondary patency (68.4% \u00b1 9.6% vs 63.7% \u00b1 10.4% for PC; P = .82), or limb salvage rates (96.2% \u00b1 3.8% vs 81.1% \u00b1 8.1%; P = .19). Multivariable analysis demonstrated no association between conduit type and loss of patency or limb. The factors most predictive of primary patency loss were limb salvage as the indication for surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 4.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-10.9; P = .003) and current hemodialysis (HR, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.08-11.4; P = .037). The most predictive factor of limb loss was current hemodialysis (HR, 7.02; 95% CI, 1.13-43.4; P = .036).",

    "abstract": "Pseudoaneurysm (PSA) formation is a complication of hemodialysis access. Open repair requires PSA resection, interposition graft placement, and insertion of a catheter as a bridge. Endovascular stent graft repair is an alternative that permits immediate use of the access site. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of stent grafts for repair of arteriovenous fistula and arteriovenous graft PSA.\nA retrospective review of medical records from October 2007 to March 2011 revealed 24 patients with a PSA who underwent endovascular repair using a stent graft. Indications for repair included PSA with symptoms (n = 11), PSA with skin erosion (n = 8), PSA with failed hemodialysis (n = 3), and PSA after balloon angioplasty of a stenosis (n = 2). Outcome measures were technical success, 30-day and 180-day patency, secondary interventions, and complications. All the statistical analyses were conducted by using software SAS 9.1 (SAS, SAS Institute, Gary, NC).\nTwenty-seven self-expanding stent grafts (Viabahn, W. L. Gore, n = 25; Fluency, Bard, n = 2) were used to treat hemodialysis access (arteriovenous graft, n = 13; arteriovenous fistula, n = 11) PSA in 24 patients (16 females; mean age, 55.7 years; mean body mass index, 28.4; mean PSA diameter, 19.5 mm). Comorbidities included hypertension (n = 22; 91.7%), diabetes mellitus (n = 8; 33.3%), and coronary artery disease (n = 4; 16.67%). The median time from access creation to repair was 455 days. The technical success rate was 100%. Balloon angioplasty of an outflow stenosis was performed in 56% of stent grafts. The 30- and 180-day patency rate was 100% and 69.2%, respectively. Three secondary interventions were performed for treatment of unrelated stenosis. Treatment failure occurred in five (18.5%) stent grafts due to infection (n = 3) and thrombosis (n = 2). Treatment of PSA with skin erosion was associated with failure due to infection (odds ratio, 5.0; 95% confidence interval, .38, 66.01). The remaining 22 (81.5%) stent grafts remain patent. The mean follow-up time was 268.9 days (median, 97.5).\nEndovascular therapy is an effective and durable treatment option for patients with dialysis access PSAs. This technique permits immediate use of the hemodialysis access site as well as identification and treatment of associated stenosis. It may be considered as an alternative to open repair in patients who are anatomically suitable candidates.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) is an epidemic in the United States and is associated with early onset of atherosclerosis, increased thrombotic events, and increased complications after cardiovascular intervention. MetSyn is found in \u223c50% of patients with peripheral vascular disease. However, its impact on peripheral interventions is unknown. The aim of this study is to determine the outcomes of superficial femoral artery (SFA) interventions in patients with and without MetSyn.\nA database of patients undergoing endovascular treatment of SFA disease between 1999 and 2009 was retrospectively queried. MetSyn was defined as the presence of \u22653 of the following criteria: blood pressure \u2265130 mm Hg/\u226585 mm Hg; triglycerides \u2265150 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein \u226450 mg/dL for women and \u226440 mg/dL for men; fasting blood glucose \u2265110 mg/dL; or body mass index \u226530 kg/m(2). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to assess time-dependent outcomes. Factor analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazard model for time-dependent variables.\nA total of 1018 limbs in 738 patients (64% male, average age 67 years) underwent endovascular treatment for symptomatic SFA disease with 45% of patients meeting the criteria for MetSyn. MetSyn patients were more likely to be female (P = .001), to present with critical ischemia (rest pain/tissue loss: 55% MetSyn vs 45% non-MetSyn; P = .001), have poorer ambulatory status (P = .001), and have more advanced SFA lesions (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus II C/D: 51% vs 11%; P = .001) and worse tibial runoff (P = .001). MetSyn patients required more complex interventions (P = .0001). There was no difference in mortality and major adverse cardiac events, but systemic complications (4% vs 1%; P = .001) and major adverse limb events (12% vs 7%; P = .0009) were significantly higher in the MetSyn group. Immediate postprocedural hemodynamic improvement, resolved or improved symptoms, and restoration of impaired ambulation were equivalent in both groups. Early failure (<6 months) was more common in those with MetSyn. At 5 years, primary, assisted primary, and secondary patencies were not affected by the presence of MetSyn. The presence of MetSyn was associated with a decrease in clinical efficacy, decreased freedom from recurrent symptoms, and decreased freedom from major amputation at 5 years.\nMetSyn is present in nearly half of the patients presenting with SFA disease. These patients present with more advanced disease and have poorer symptomatic and functional outcomes compared with those patients without MetSyn.",

Since 2004, iliac artery stent grafts were the primary treatment except for complex fistulas with enteric contamination or abscess. Endpoints were early morbidity and mortality, patient survival, vessel or graft patency, freedom from vascular or stent graft/graft infection, and freedom from recurrent bleeding.\nThere were 20 patients, 15 females, and five males, with mean age of 63 \u00b113 years. Predisposing factors for UIAF were prior tumor resection in 18 patients, radiation in 15, ureteral stents in 15, ileal conduits in four, and ileofemoral grafts in three. All patients presented with hematuria, which was massive in 10. Treatment included iliac stent grafts in 11 patients/12 fistulas (55%), with internal iliac artery (IAA) exclusion in nine, femoral crossover graft with IAA exclusion in five, direct arterial repair in three, and ureteral exclusion with percutaneous nephrostomy and no arterial repair in one. There were no early deaths. Five of eight patients treated by open surgical repair developed complications, which included enterocutaneous fistula in three and superficial wound infection in two. Four patients (36%) treated by iliac stent grafts had complications, including pneumonia, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, buttock claudication, and early stent occlusion in one each. After a median follow-up of 26 months, no one had recurrent massive hematuria, but minor bleeding was reported in three. Patient survival at 5 years was 42% compared with 93% for the general population (P < .001). Freedom from any recurrent bleeding at 3 years was 76%. In the stent graft group, primary and secondary patency rates and freedom from stent graft infection at 3 years were 81%, 92%, and 100%.\nUIAF is a rare complication associated with prior tumor resection, radiation, and indwelling ureteral stents. In select patients without enteric communication or abscess, iliac artery stent grafts are safe and effective treatment, and carry a low risk of recurrent massive hematuria or stent graft infection on early follow-up. Direct surgical repair carries a high risk of enterocutaneous fistula.",

    "abstract": "Women have a lower chance of surviving elective open abdominal aortic repair. The reasons for this are not clear. Endovascular repair has clearly reduced early and midterm morbidity and mortality for patients with large abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). However, most patients are male. It is unclear whether there has been any reduction in elective morbidity for females or what the extent of that reduction has been. We prospectively analyzed outcomes for elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in women at our center and compared results with those for elective open surgery and emergent open and endovascular repair.\nAll patients undergoing elective and emergency AAA from 2002 to 2009 were prospectively entered into a database. Demographic details, including gender, were tabulated. Outcome measures were operative blood loss, incidence of type 1 endoleaks, length of in-hospital stay, postoperative complications, 30-day all-cause mortality, and secondary interventions during the follow-up period. Statistical analysis was performed using Fischer exact test and Student t test. A multivariate analysis was also performed.\nFrom 2002 to 2009, there were 2631 abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) open and endovascular repairs performed in our center (1698 endovascular aneurysm repairs [EVARs], 933 \"open\"). Males comprised 1995 (76%) of patients; females 636 (24%). There were 1592 elective EVARs (1248 male, 344 female) and 106 emergency EVARs (73 male, 33 female). Elective open repair was performed in 788 patients (579 male, 209 female) and emergency open repair in 149 (73 male, 76 female). For women, elective EVAR resulted in significantly greater mortality rates than men (3.2% vs 0.96%, P < .005). There was a greater incidence of intraoperative aortic neck or iliac artery rupture (4.1% vs 1.2% P = .002) and use of Palmaz stents for type 1 endoleaks (16.1% vs 8%, P = .0009). Mean blood loss was greater in females (327 mL vs 275 mL, P = .038). Perioperative complications were also more frequent in women: leg ischemia (3.5% vs 0.6%, P = .003) and colon ischemia requiring colectomy (0.9% vs 0.2%, P = .009). Mean hospital stay was also longer (3.7 days vs 2.2 days, P = .0001). In contrast, there were no gender differences for any of these outcome measures for elective open repair or emergency open surgery or EVAR. There was no significant difference in death rates between EVAR and open repair in women (3.2% vs 5.7%). In males, the 30-day mortality was 0.96% for elective EVAR and 4.7% for elective open surgery. Following logistic regression, female gender remains a significant risk even when the effects of aneurysm size and age are considered (odds ratio 3.4, P < .01).\nMortality for females undergoing elective EVAR is significantly greater than for males. It is also more hazardous. Colon ischemia, native arterial rupture, and type 1 endoleaks are more frequent. Elective endovascular aneurysm repair benefits men more than women.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe the incidence, management, and outcomes of mesenteric artery complications (MACs) during angioplasty and stent placement (MAS) for chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI).\nWe retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 156 patients treated with 173 MAS for CMI (1998-2010). MACs were defined as procedure-related mesenteric artery dissection, stent dislodgement, embolization, thrombosis, or perforation. End points were procedure-related morbidity and death.\nThere were 113 women and 43 men (mean age, 73 \u00b1 14 years). Eleven patients (7%) developed 14 MACs, including distal mesenteric embolization in six, branch perforation in three, dissection in two, stent dislodgement in two, and stent thrombosis in one. Five patients required adjunctive endovascular procedures, including in two patients each, catheter-directed thrombolysis or aspiration, retrieval of dislodged stents, and placement of additional stents for dissection. Five patients (45%) required conversion to open repair: two required evacuation of mesenteric hematoma, two required mesenteric revascularization, and one required bowel resection. There were four early deaths (2.5%) due to mesenteric embolization or myocardial infarction in two patients each. Patients with MACs had higher rates of mortality (18% vs 1.5%) and morbidity (64% vs 19%; P <.05) and a longer hospital length of stay (6.3 \u00b1 4.2 vs 1.6 \u00b1 1.2 days) than those without MACs. Periprocedural use of antiplatelet therapy was associated with lower risk of distal embolization or vessel thrombosis (odds ratio, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.90). Patients treated by a large-profile system had a trend toward more MACs (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-26.5; P = .07).\nMACs occurred in 7% of patients who underwent MAS for CMI and resulted in higher mortality, morbidity, and longer hospital length of stay. Use of antiplatelet therapy reduced the risk of distal embolization or vessel thrombosis. There was a trend toward more MACs in patients who underwent interventions performed with a large-profile system.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective study analyzed the characteristics, potential risks, and therapeutic options of true aneurysms of the donor artery in arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) for dialysis access.\nWe retrospectively collected data of patients with aneurysmal degeneration (AD) after AVF creation from surgeons who were members of the French Society for Vascular Access, treated from January 2006 to May 2011. The study excluded patients with pseudoaneurysms. Patient demographics, type of access, aneurysm characteristics, symptoms, treatment, and follow-up were recorded.\nSeven men and three women (mean age, 38.1 \u00b1 5.3 years) were identified with AD (mean diameter, 44.5; range, 24-80 mm) Mean duration of access was 83.6 \u00b1 48.8 months. Diagnosis of AD was at 117.5 \u00b1 53.8 months after access creation. The initial access was radiocephalic, six; ulnobasilic, one; brachiocephalic, two; and brachiobasilic, one. Three patients had two successive accesses: one brachioaxillary polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft and two proximalizations of a failed radiocephalic AVF. Symptoms were pain and swelling, four; pain related to total thrombosis without signs of ischemia, two; median nerve compression, two; pain related to contained rupture, one; and subacute ischemia due to embolic occlusion of both radial and interosseous arteries, one. AD location was brachial, seven; axillary, one; radial, one; and ulnar, one. Eight patients underwent surgical aneurysm excision associated with interposition bypass using great saphenous vein, two; basilic vein, one; PTFE, three; Dacron, one; and allograft, one. Two patients needed secondary PTFE bypass because of progression of AD to the inflow artery and dilatation of the venous bypass. With a mean follow-up of 20.3 \u00b1 17 months, all bypasses but one remained patent.\nAD is a rare but significant complication of vascular access. Surgical correction should be discussed in most cases due to potential complications. After resection, the choice of reconstructive conduit is not straightforward.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence regarding carotid revascularization advises against carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) in patients aged >70 years with conventional risk for carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The poor outcome of transfemoral CAS in this age group may be explained by the anatomic characteristics of the aortic trunk and supra-aortic vessels in elderly patients, as well as by a high prevalence of aortic arch atheromatosis. Transcervical CAS with flow reversal for cerebral protection avoids these unfavorable characteristics. This study analyzed the short-term and middle-term results of transcervical CAS with flow reversal in patients aged >70 years at high risk for CEA.\nBetween January 2006 and January 2011, 219 cases of >70% carotid artery stenosis in high-risk patients aged >70 years (55.7% asymptomatic and 44.3% symptomatic) were treated by transcervical CAS. All patients underwent complete neurologic examination by a stroke neurologist before and after the procedure. Primary end points were stroke, death, or myocardial infarction (MI), technical success, and complications at 30 days. During follow-up, we analyzed the rate of restenosis \u226550% and ipsilateral stroke. Data were collected prospectively and outcome was analyzed in all cases, including technical failures.\nThe 30-day combined stroke/death/MI rate was 2.2% (stroke, 1.8%; stroke/death, 2.2%; and MI, 0.45%). In symptomatic patients, stroke/death/MI was 5.1% (stroke, 4.1%; stroke/death, 5.1%). None of the asymptomatic patients suffered stroke, MI, or death postoperatively. Technical success was 96.3% (four inability to cross lesion, two major common carotid dissections, one failed preangioplasty, one stent thrombosis). One cervical hematoma required surgical drainage. At follow-up (18.8 \u00b1 16.9 months), cumulative (standard error) incidence of >70% restenosis was 3% (1%) at 1 year and 8% (3%) at 2 and 3 years. Only one patient experienced ipsilateral stroke during follow-up. Overall survival (standard error) was 94% (2%) at 1 year and 90% (3%) at 2 and 3 years.\nIn our experience, transcervical CAS with flow reversal is a safe technique for treating carotid stenosis in patients aged >70 years. We believe that avoiding the aortic arch and tortuous supra-aortic vessels is responsible for the favorable results in this study.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord ischemia (SCI) is a catastrophic complication of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. This article describes our early experience with a technique for maintaining perfusion of segmental vessels (intercostals and lumbars) in the early postoperative period after endovascular repair of a TAAA, with \"sac perfusion branches\" added to custom-made stent grafts. These are closed 7 to 10 days after the first procedure to complete exclusion of the aneurysm. We have used this technique in 10 patients with type II TAAAs. One developed monoparesis of the right leg during a period of hypotension secondary to a cardiac event and died within 30 days. Two patients developed lower limb weakness after closure of the perfusion branches, both with full recovery. Controlled perfusion of segmental vessels with perfusion branches is feasible and may be a useful adjunct to prevent SCI, providing protection to spinal cord perfusion during the immediate postoperative period when risk of SCI is greatest.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty \u00b1 stent (PTA/S) and surgical bypass are both accepted treatments for claudication due to superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusive disease. However, long-term results comparing these modalities for primary intervention in patients who have had no prior intervention have not been reported. We report our results with 3-year follow-up.\nWe reviewed all lower extremity bypass procedures at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2001 through 2009 and all PTA/S performed from 2005 through 2009 for claudication. We excluded all limb salvage procedures and included only those that were undergoing their first intervention for claudication due to SFA disease. We recorded patient demographics, comorbidities, perioperative medications, TASC classification, and runoff. Outcomes included complications, restenosis, symptom recurrence, reinterventions, major amputation, and mortality.\nWe identified 113 bypass grafts and 105 PTA/S of femoral-popliteal lesions without prior interventions. Bypasses were above the knee in 62% (45% vein) and below the knee in 38% (100% vein). Mean age was 63 (bypass) versus 69 (PTA/S; P < .01). Mean length of stay (LOS) was 3.9 versus 1.2 days (P < .01). Bypass grafts were used less for TASC A (17% vs 40%; P < .01) and more for TASC C (36% vs 11%; P < .01) and TASC D (13% vs 3%; P < .01) lesions. There were no differences in perioperative (2% vs 0%; not significant [NS]) or 3-year mortality (9% vs 8%; NS). Wound infection was higher with bypass (16% vs 0%; P < .01). None involved grafts. Bypass showed improved freedom from restenosis (73% vs 42% at 3 years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], .23-.71), symptom recurrence (70% and 36% at 3 years; HR, 0.37; 95% CI, .2-.56), and freedom from symptoms at last follow-up (83% vs 49%; HR, 0.18; 95% CI, .08-.40). There was no difference in freedom from reintervention (77% vs 66% at 3 years; NS). Multivariable analysis of all patients showed that restenosis was predicted by PTA/S (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-4.4) and TASC D (HR, 3.7; 95% CI, 3.5-9) lesions. Recurrence of symptoms was similarly predicted by PTA/S (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.8-5) and TASC D lesions (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4-7). Statin use postoperatively was predictive of patency (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, .35-.97) and freedom from recurrent symptoms (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, .36-.93).\nSurgical bypass for the primary treatment of claudication showed improved freedom from restenosis and symptom relief despite treatment of more extensive disease, but was associated with increased LOS and wound infection. Statins improved freedom from restenosis and symptom recurrence overall.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the changes of the aortic diameter at the suprarenal and infrarenal segment after open repair (OR) and endovascular repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).\nThis was a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing AAA repair between 1997 and 2008. Inclusion criteria were at least 3 months of follow-up at our institution, elective aneurysm repair, and absence of false, mycotic, or inflammatory aneurysms. For EVAR, standard computed tomography (CT) scans from follow-up were used; in the OR group, CT scans performed for unrelated nonvascular indications were used. Diameters of the aorta were measured at the first slice below the lowest renal artery and at the first slice above the highest renal artery. A 2-mm change was defined as measurable aortic neck dilatation.\nInclusion criteria were met by 46 patients in the OR group and 103 in the EVAR group. After a follow-up of 34.1 months (range, 5.5-131.7 months) in the OR group and 39.4 months (range, 3-108.9 months) in the EVAR group, the mean changes were 1.75 \u00b1 3.50 mm (OR) and 0.9 \u00b1 2.3 mm (EVAR; P = .305) in the suprarenal diameters and 0.8 \u00b1 2.9 mm (OR) and 1.2 \u00b1 2.5 mm (EVAR; P = .311) in the infrarenal diameters. The absolute suprarenal vs infrarenal sizes were 29.7 \u00b1 7.1 and 28.7 \u00b1 6.8 mm in the OR group and 28.7 \u00b1 3.2 and 28.5 \u00b1 3.6 mm, respectively, in the EVAR group (suprarenal, P = .749; infrarenal, P = .273). Increase of the aortic diameter >2 mm, defined as aortic neck dilatation, was found in 23 of 103 EVAR patients (22.3% \u00b1 0.862%), and in nine of 46 OR patients (19.57% \u00b1 0.484%; P = .870). Increase in the suprarenal change >2 mm occurred in 21 of 103 EVAR patients (20.39% \u00b1 1.04%) and in 14 of 46 OR patients (30.4% \u00b1 0.446%; P = .260). Reintervention rate of patients with an increase >2 mm was 31% (seven of 23) in EVAR and 11.1% (one of nine) in the OR group (P = .386).\nThe AAA groups treated with EVAR or OR demonstrated similar increases of aneurysmal neck diameters. This suggests that aortic neck dilatation may be caused by a natural progression of the disease rather than by deviating therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the accuracy of central luminal line (CLL) measurements in quantifying stent graft migration. The bias of the CLL technique together with observer variability were assessed.\nStent grafts were deployed in plastic aortic phantoms at fixed locations from two side branches. Each phantom was filled with iodinated contrast, and a 2-mm multislice computed tomography (CT) scan was performed. The stent graft was then displaced caudally, its new location determined, and again, a CT scan performed. This created a series of 15 cases with known stent graft migration. CLLs were used to measure stent graft position on the CT scans and calculate migration (3 observers). In vivo stent graft migration was then evaluated in a similar manner using a series of follow-up CT scans from nine patients (2 observers). All CLL measurements were performed independently and were repeated on a separate occasion.\nThe mean difference in CLL migration between the actual and observed measurements (bias) in the aortic phantoms was <1 mm. The 95% confidence intervals for the bias were within the interval (-1 and 1 mm), and the 95% limits of agreement were within -3 mm and +3 mm. The 95% limits of agreement for measurements within and between observers were -4 to 2 mm and -2 to 2 mm, respectively. The phantom study generated a coefficient of repeatability (RC) of 1 mm for within-observer measurements. Clinically, CLLs generated 95% limits of agreement within and between observers of -3 to 4 mm (RC, 2 mm) and -3 to +3 mm, respectively.\nBias from CLL-determined migration is small and insignificant from a practical point of view. A small amount of measurement variability within and between observers does exist; it should be feasible to detect changes in stent graft position that are \u22654 mm.",

The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between periodontal disease and CVD in observational studies.\nAn electronic search of the English literature using PubMed was conducted. A meta-analysis of the studies reporting on the risk of stroke in patients with periodontitis was performed.\nSix prospective and seven retrospective studies met the inclusion criteria. Patients with both hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular events, fatal and nonfatal, were included. Definition of periodontitis was taken directly from included studies. Most studies have been adjusted for common cardiovascular risk factors. Separate statistical analysis was performed for prospective and retrospective studies. Overall adjusted risk of stroke in subjects with periodontitis was 1.47 times higher than in subjects without (95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.92;P = .0035) in prospective and 2.63 times (95% confidence interval, 1.59-4.33;P = .0002) in retrospective studies. The application of the trim and fill algorithm does not change the initial significant inference.\nThere is evidence that periodontitis is associated with increased risk of stroke. However, the results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution because of the heterogeneity of the studies as well as the differences in periodontitis definition.",

    "abstract": "Resistin, an adipocytokine, plays a potential role in cardiovascular disease and may contribute to increased atherosclerotic risk by modulating the activity of endothelial cells. A growing body of evidence suggests that aspirin is a potent antioxidant. We investigated whether aspirin mitigates resistin-induced endothelial dysfunction via modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and explored the role that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a negative regulator of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, plays in the suppressive effects of aspirin on resistin-induced endothelial dysfunction.\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pretreated with various doses of aspirin (10-500 \u03bcg/mL) for 2 hours and then incubated with resistin (100 ng/mL) for an additional 48 hours. Fluorescence produced by the oxidation of dihydroethidium (DHE) was used to quantify the production of superoxide in situ; superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities were determined by an enzymatic assay; and protein levels of AMPK-mediated downstream signaling were investigated by Western blot.\nTreatment of HUVECs with resistin for 48 hours resulted in a 2.9-fold increase in superoxide production; however, pretreatment with aspirin resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in production of superoxide (10-500 \u03bcg/mL; n = 3 experiments; all P < .05). Resistin also suppressed the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase by nearly 50%; that result, however, was not observed in HUVECs that had been pretreated with aspirin at a concentration of 500 \u03bcg/mL. The membrane translocation assay showed that the levels of NADPH oxidase subunits p47(phox)and Rac-1 in membrane fractions of HUVECs were threefold to fourfold higher in cells that had been treated with resistin for 1 hour than in untreated cells; however, pretreatment with aspirin markedly inhibited resistin-induced membrane assembly of NADPH oxidase via modulating AMPK-suppressed PKC-\u03b1 activation. Application of AMPK\u03b11-specific siRNA resulted in increased activation of PKC-\u03b1 and p47(phox). In addition, resistin significantly decreased AMPK-mediated downstream Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)/nitric oxide (NO) signaling and induced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, which in turn activated NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory responses such as the release of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, the overexpression of adhesion molecules, and stimulation of monocytic THP-1 cell attachment to HUVECs (2.5-fold vs control; n = 3 experiments). Furthermore, resistin downregulated eNOS and upregulated inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression, thereby augmenting the formation of NO and protein nitrosylation. Pretreatment with aspirin, however, exerted significant cytoprotective effects in a dose-dependent manner (P < .05).\nOur findings suggest a direct connection between adipocytokines and endothelial dysfunction and provide further insight into the protective effects of aspirin in obese individuals with endothelial dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The lack of readily available branched and fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) options has created an opportunity for creative deployment of endograft components to treat juxtarenal aneurysms. We present our early experience with \"snorkel\" or \"chimney\" techniques in the endovascular management of complex aortic aneurysms.\nWe retrospectively reviewed planned snorkel procedures for juxtarenal aneurysms performed from September 2009 to August 2011. Our standardized technique included axillary or brachial cutdown for delivery of covered snorkel stents and mostly percutaneous femoral access for the main body endograft.\nFifty-six snorkel grafts were successfully placed in 28 consecutive patients (mean age, 75 years) with juxtarenal aneurysms. Mean aneurysm size was 64.8 mm (range, 53-87 mm). The snorkel configuration extended the proximal seal zone from an unsuitable infrarenal neck for standard EVAR (median diameter, 33.5 mm; length, 0.0 mm) to a median neck diameter of 24.5 mm and length of 18.0 mm. Five patients had unilateral renal snorkels, 17 had bilateral renal snorkels, and six had celiac/superior mesenteric artery/renal combinations. Technical success of snorkel placements was 98.2%, with loss of wire access leading to one renal stent deployment failure. Thirty-day mortality was 7.1%: one patient was readmitted 1 week postoperatively with pneumonia and died of sepsis; one patient died at 1 week of a right hemispheric stroke. Other major complications included perinephric hematomas, 7.1%; permanent hemodialysis, 3.6%; iliac artery injury requiring endoconduit placement, 3.6%; and brachial plexus nerve injury, 3.6%. Cardiac complications included self-limited arrhythmias (14.3%) and one non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (3.6%), with all recovering without coronary intervention. Mean follow-up was 10.7 months (range, 3-25 months). One patient died of nonaneurysmal-related causes at 3 months (89.3% survival). Postoperative imaging revealed one renal snorkel graft occlusion occurring at 3 months (98.2% overall primary patency). Seven (25%) early endoleaks were noted on the first follow-up computed tomography angiography: two type I, three type II, and two type III (25%), leading to one secondary intervention (3.6%) with bridging cuff placement (type III). The small type Ia endoleaks and other type III endoleak resolved at the 6-month scan. Mean sac regression at the latest follow-up was 7.3 mm. No aneurysm has enlarged on postoperative imaging.\nEarly success with the snorkel technique for juxtarenal aneurysms has made it our procedure of choice for complex short-neck to no-neck EVAR. Although long-term follow-up is needed, the flexibility of the snorkel technique and lack of requirement for custom-built devices may make this approach more attractive than branched or fenestrated stent grafts.",

    "abstract": "Whether a typical patient and symptom profile is associated with proximal or distal lesions in lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is unknown. Knowing which patient characteristics, exertional leg symptoms, and cardiovascular risk profile accompany the anatomic lesion location may facilitate a more tailor-made management of PAD.\nThis cross-sectional study comprised 701 patients from two vascular surgery outpatient clinics with new-onset symptoms of PAD (Fontaine 2) who underwent duplex ultrasound (DUS) examinations from March 2006 to March 2011. The main outcome measures were patient characteristics, self-reported leg symptoms, and cardiovascular risk factors as documented from questionnaires and medical records. Peripheral lesion information, categorized by proximal and distal lesions, was obtained from DUS examinations. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed of proximal vs nonproximal lesions, distal vs nondistal lesions, and proximal and distal vs absence of having both lesions to assess relationships between patient characteristics, leg symptom categories (typical vs atypical leg symptoms), cardiovascular risk factors, and anatomic lesion location.\nLesions were proximal in 270 (38.5%), distal in 441 (62.9%), and proximal and distal in 94 (13.4%). Patients with proximal lesions were younger (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; P < .0001) and less likely to be obese (OR, 0.34; P < .0001) than those without proximal lesions. Older age (OR, 1.07; P < .0001), male sex (OR, 1.96; P = .003), being without a partner (OR, 2.24; P = .004), and lower anxiety scores (OR, 0.42; P = .003) were associated with distal lesions. Patients with both lesions were more likely to be single (OR, 2.30; P = .010) and less likely to be obese (OR, 0.24; P = .009). No distinguishing leg symptom pattern was observed for patients with proximal lesions. Intermittent claudication was more frequently reported in those with distal lesions (P = .011). Although buttock and thigh pain seemed to be somewhat more present in proximal lesions (P < .01) and calf pain more in distal lesions (P < .001), patients still reported pain at a variety of levels throughout their legs, regardless of the anatomic lesion location.\nTwo distinctive PAD phenotypes-each with its own characteristics and risk factors-emerged by anatomic lesion location; however, PAD-specific leg symptoms did not always reflect the anatomic lesion location. These findings may open new opportunities to better tailor PAD management to these two PAD subgroups and may raise awareness about not relying on self-reported symptoms to guide further diagnostic imaging and peripheral lesion management.",

    "abstract": "Initial TransAtlantic Inter-Society consensus (TASC) II classification has been shown to influence the patency of stented femoral and popliteal arteries. Although several studies have shown the effect of the number of runoff vessels on the durability of infrainguinal angioplasty without stenting, the influence of tibial vessel runoff on the patency of primarily stented femoral and popliteal arteries has not been as well defined. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the number of patent tibial vessels affects primary patency after primary stenting of the femoral and popliteal arteries.\nThe records of all patients undergoing angioplasty and primary nitinol stenting of the femoral and popliteal arteries, by or under the supervision of one vascular surgeon, were reviewed. Results were analyzed by both the number of patent tibial vessels documented on periprocedural angiography and by using a modified Society for Vascular Surgery runoff score. TASC II classification was also recorded. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted and differences between groups tested by log-rank method. Fisher exact and \u03c7(2) tests were used to compare categoric factors.\nDuring a 7-year period, 289 limbs in 236 patients underwent primary stenting of the femoral and popliteal arteries. Overall primary patency was 70.3% at 12 months, 52.4% at 24 months, and 39.1% at 36 months. Limbs classified as TASC A or B had significantly better patency rates than those classified as TASC C or D (P < .001). While the number of runoff vessels decreased with worsening of the TASC classification (P = .024), overall (P = .355), and within individual TASC classes (P \u2265 .092 for each), there was no difference in the primary patency of stented segments with good runoff and those with compromised runoff. Limbs with poor runoff (one or no vessels) were no more likely to fail with occlusion than their counterparts with two or three patent tibial vessels (P = .383). The number of patent tibial vessels at the time of initial stenting did not impact ultimate limb salvage (P = .063).\nThe number of patent tibial vessels does not influence the primary patency of primarily stented femoral and popliteal arteries. TASC II classification appears to be significantly more predictive of initial failure after angioplasty and stenting of these vessels.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the results of thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) for chronic descending thoracic aortic (DTA) dissections with aneurysmal degeneration.\nOver 70 months at a single institution, 27 patients underwent TEVAR for aneurysms related to chronic (>6 weeks) DTA dissections.\nMean patient age was 67.5 \u00b1 9.6 years; 18 were men. Primary indications for repair were aneurysm size (n = 20), rapid aneurysmal growth (n = 5), saccular aneurysm (n = 1), and rupture (n = 1). Preoperative false lumen status was patent in 18 patients, partially thrombosed in 8 patients, and unknown in the patient whose aneurysm ruptured. The proximal entry tear was covered in all 27 patients. Fourteen patients required coverage of the left subclavian artery, of which 9 patients underwent prophylactic revascularization. On completion angiogram, no patient had antegrade perfusion of the aneurysmal false lumen. There were three procedural complications: 2 patients sustained paraparesis (one resolved and one improved), and 1 patient had an access injury requiring stent graft placement. Thirty-day mortality was 3.7% (1 of 27); the one death was in the patient whose aneurysm ruptured. Of the 26 surviving patients, 23 (88.5%) had thrombosis of the aneurysmal false lumen. Twenty-two patients (84.6%) had stability or decrease in maximal aneurysm diameter on last radiographic follow-up at 18 \u00b1 20 months. Three-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 90.3% \u00b1 6.5% in the 26 patients who survived to hospital discharge, with a mean follow-up of 27.3 \u00b1 22.1 months. In patients with preoperatively partially thrombosed false lumens (n = 8), 3-year survival was 100%.\nTEVAR for aneurysms due to chronic dissections of the DTA can be performed safely and effectively at midterm follow-up according to this single-institution study. Stent graft therapy may be of particular benefit in patients presenting with partially thrombosed false lumens.",

Primary indications for repair were aneurysm size (n = 20), rapid aneurysmal growth (n = 5), saccular aneurysm (n = 1), and rupture (n = 1). Preoperative false lumen status was patent in 18 patients, partially thrombosed in 8 patients, and unknown in the patient whose aneurysm ruptured. The proximal entry tear was covered in all 27 patients. Fourteen patients required coverage of the left subclavian artery, of which 9 patients underwent prophylactic revascularization. On completion angiogram, no patient had antegrade perfusion of the aneurysmal false lumen. There were three procedural complications: 2 patients sustained paraparesis (one resolved and one improved), and 1 patient had an access injury requiring stent graft placement. Thirty-day mortality was 3.7% (1 of 27); the one death was in the patient whose aneurysm ruptured. Of the 26 surviving patients, 23 (88.5%) had thrombosis of the aneurysmal false lumen. Twenty-two patients (84.6%) had stability or decrease in maximal aneurysm diameter on last radiographic follow-up at 18 \u00b1 20 months. Three-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 90.3% \u00b1 6.5% in the 26 patients who survived to hospital discharge, with a mean follow-up of 27.3 \u00b1 22.1 months.

    "abstract": "The Protected Carotid Artery Stenting in Patients at High Risk for Carotid Endarterectomy (PROTECT) study was performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of two devices for carotid artery stenting (CAS) in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis in patients at high risk for carotid endarterectomy (CEA): (1) a new embolic protection device, the Emboshield Pro (Abbott Vascular, Abbott Park, Ill), using the periprocedural composite end point of 30-day death, stroke, and myocardial infarction (DSMI), and (2) a carotid stent in conjunction with an embolic protection device (EPD) using the DSMI periprocedural composite end point plus ipsilateral stroke at up to 3 years for long-term evaluation.\nThis prospective, multicenter clinical trial enrolled 220 consecutive participants between November 29, 2006, and January 14, 2008, followed by a second cohort of 102 participants between January 14 and June 18, 2008. Enrolled participants had carotid stenosis (symptomatic >50% or asymptomatic >80%). The first 220 subjects underwent distal EPD placement with a new large-diameter filter, and the second cohort of 102 underwent placement of an older EPD that is no longer manufactured. All 322 participants were to be treated with a dedicated carotid stent with a tapered, small, closed-cell design (Xact; Abbott Vascular) and were to be included in the long-term evaluation. Independent neurologic assessment was performed before CAS and at 1 day, 30 days, and annually after CAS. All primary end point events were independently adjudicated by a central committee.\nThe periprocedural composite end point of DSMI (95% confidence interval) in the first 220 participants was 2.3% (0.74%, 5.22%), with a combined death and stroke rate of 1.8% (0.50%, 4.59%) and a rate of death and major stroke of 0.5% (0.01%, 2.51%). As of January 3, 2011, the median follow-up for the entire 322-subject cohort for the long-term evaluation was 2.8 years. Freedom from the periprocedural composite of DSMI plus ipsilateral stroke thereafter was 95.4%, with an annualized ipsilateral stroke rate of 0.4%.\nCAS outcomes in patients at high risk for CEA have improved from earlier carotid stent trials. With periprocedural rates of DSMI of 2.3%, death or stroke at 1.8%, and death or major stroke rate of 0.5%, PROTECT has the lowest rate of periprocedural complications among other comparable single-arm CAS trials in patients at high risk for CEA.",

Management of graft limb thrombosis requires restoration of inflow and correction of any causative outflow lesions. Successful, minimally invasive inflow restoration with catheter thrombectomy can become problematic if assessment of technical adequacy is deficient or reveals causal lesions within the graft body. We describe a case illustrating the potential shortfall of retrograde graft limb completion angiography in depicting neointimal flaps, the benefit of antegrade angiography in depicting these flaps, and a novel utilization of a standard endovascular method to correct flaps that involve the graft body.",

    "abstract": "There are many recent and ongoing changes in the practice of medicine from a business standpoint as well as in overall practice management. Economic and lifestyle desires have pushed many physicians to a decision point of whether or not to join a large multispecialty group or to sell their practice and become an employee of a hospital system. There are advantages and disadvantages to both options; however, deciding on the most appropriate path for each individual can be a daunting task. At our recent breakfast session at the vascular annual meeting in Chicago, Illinois, in June 2011, we brought to light these topics to try and help enlighten physicians on which option may be right for them. There is no single answer/option that will fit every practice, but discussion for various practice management designs are outlined and critiqued. This article cannot fully discuss each view in the allotted space, but it is designed to encourage thought and discussion among the vascular surgical community as a whole.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients undergoing elective repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and the longitudinal trends in surgical management (open repair vs endovascular aneurysm repair [EVAR]), factors associated with the choice of surgical technique, and differences in the rate of in-hospital mortality at a single large-volume Canadian center.\nThis retrospective cohort study used data from a prospectively collected vascular surgery database and reviewed all patients undergoing elective repair of an infrarenal AAA over a recent 10-year period (June 2000-May 2010). Information was reviewed regarding surgical techniques, patient demographics, and short-term outcomes. Subsequent analysis included univariate statistics and multivariable logistic regression with data presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nA total of 1942 patients underwent elective AAA repair over this 10-year study period, 1067 (54.9%) via open repair and 875 (45.1%) via EVAR. The proportion of patients undergoing EVAR was significantly higher in the latter half of the study period compared to the first half (55.8% vs 33.9%; P < .01). Older patients (75 vs 71; P < .01) and those with higher American Society of Anesthesiologists classifications (P < .01) were more likely to receive endovascular repair than open repair. The overall in-hospital mortality rate in the entire cohort was low (2.3% for EVAR and 3.9% for open repair), and after multivariable logistic regression and adjustment for preoperative factors, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with open AAA repair (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.04-3.13; P = .04).\nThis 10-year analysis shows a significant shift toward an endovascular approach in the repair of infrarenal AAAs at our Canadian center. Similar to other jurisdictions, higher risk and older patients are more likely to be treated with an endovascular repair resulting in a survival advantage in these patients compared to standard open repair.",

DVT was diagnosed by clinical symptoms and Doppler ultrasound imaging. Subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin was eased 12 hours before cesarean delivery and restarted 12 hours after delivery. The caval filters were placed suprarenally from the jugular approach and retrieved from the femoral approach.\nThe filters were successfully placed in all patients on the day of cesarean delivery. No placement-related complications occurred. The caval filter was left in situ as a permanent device in one patient because the captured thrombus within the filter was not eliminated after the thrombolytic therapy. Filters in other 14 patients were retrieved successfully, without difficulty, including in one patient after complete lysis of captured thrombus by the thrombolytic therapy. Oral warfarin therapy was recommended for at least 3 months after hospital discharge, and for at least 6 months in the patient with a caval filter left in situ. All patients were examined by Doppler ultrasound imaging during the follow-up. None presented with symptomatic pulmonary embolism or filter-related complications.\nOptEase retrievable vena cava filter placement and retrieval in term pregnant patients with extensive DVT of the lower extremities is safe, effective, and feasible.

Aneurysmal involvement at the iliac bifurcation potentially undermines long-term durability.\nPatients with CIAA who underwent EVAR were identified in two teaching hospitals. Bell-bottom technique (BBT; iliac limb \u226520 mm) or internal iliac artery embolization and limb extension to the external iliac artery (IIE + EE) were used. Outcome between these two approaches was compared.\nWe identified 185 patients. Indication for EVAR included asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 157, symptomatic or ruptured aneurysm in 19, and CIAA in nine. Mean AAA diameter was 59 mm. Among 260 large CIAAs that were treated, BBT was used to treat 166 CIAA limbs, and 94 limbs underwent IIE + EE. Total reintervention rates were 11% for BBT (n = 19) and 19.1% for IIE + EE (n = 18; P = .149). Rates of reintervention for type Ib or III endoleak were 4% for BBT (n = 7) and 4% for IIE + EE (n = 4; P > .99). The difference in limb patency rates was not significant. The 30-day mortality rate was 1%. Median follow-up was 22 months. Complications did not differ significantly between the two groups; however, the combined incidence of perioperative complications and reinterventions was higher in the IIE + EE group (49% vs 22%; P = .002).\nThe combined incidence of perioperative complications and reinterventions is significantly higher with IIE + EE than with BBT; therefore, when feasible, BBT is desirable.",

Total reintervention rates were 11% for BBT (n = 19) and 19.1% for IIE + EE (n = 18; P = .149). Rates of reintervention for type Ib or III endoleak were 4% for BBT (n = 7) and 4% for IIE + EE (n = 4; P > .99). The difference in limb patency rates was not significant. The 30-day mortality rate was 1%. Median follow-up was 22 months. Complications did not differ significantly between the two groups; however, the combined incidence of perioperative complications and reinterventions was higher in the IIE + EE group (49% vs 22%; P = .002).",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of proteins related to cytoskeleton and energetic metabolism at abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) sites using proteomics. Several remodeling-related mechanisms have been associated with AAA formation but less is known about the expression of proteins associated with cytoskeleton and energetic metabolism in AAAs.\nAAA samples (6.73 \u00b1 0.40 cm size) were obtained from 13 patients during elective aneurysm repair. Control abdominal aortic samples were obtained from 12 organ donors. Proteins were analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry.\nThe expression of filamin was increased in the AAA site compared to control abdominal aortic samples while microfibril-associated glycoprotein-4 isotype 1, annexin A5 isotype 1, and annexin A2 were reduced compared with control abdominal aortic samples. Reduction in expression level of energetic metabolism-associated proteins such as triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase was also observed in AAAs compared to controls. Reduction of triosephosphate isomerase expression was also observed by Western blot, which was accompanied by diminished triosephosphate isomerase activity. At the AAA site, pyruvate dehydrogenase expression was reduced and the content of both lactate and pyruvate was increased with respect to controls without changes in lactate dehydrogenase activity.\nThe present results suggest that an anaerobic metabolic state may be favored further to reduce the expression of cytoskeleton-related proteins. The better knowledge of molecular mechanism involved in AAAs may favor development of new clinical strategies.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown the importance of proximal and distal endograft fixation. There is little information on the middle, unsupported section of endograft within the aneurysm sac. We quantified sideways movement of the endograft within the aneurysm sac and correlated it to late adverse events.\nPatients who underwent endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair with a suprarenal or infrarenal endograft between January 1997 and December 2007 were analyzed for sideways endograft movement. Patients were included if they had a digital preoperative computed tomography angiogram (CTA), a postoperative CTA within 3 months after the index procedure, and at least one follow-up CTA thereafter with a minimal time interval of 6 months. The endograft position within the aneurysm sac was quantitated on cross-sectional images using a fixed vertebral body reference point. Patients with change in endograft position \u22655 mm were placed in the sideways displacement (SD) group and compared with patients with no displacement (ND; <5 mm change in position). The relationship between sideways endograft movement and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)-related complications were noted for AAA rupture, AAA-related death, conversion, secondary procedures, AAA growth (\u22655 mm), proximal migration (\u226510 mm), and new onset of type I or III endoleaks.\nThe study included 144 patients (mean age, 76 \u00b1 7.6 years). Mean follow-up time was 43 \u00b1 27 months. Fifty patients (35%) had sideways endograft movement \u22655 mm during follow-up. Baseline AAA diameter was larger (SD 60 \u00b1 9 mm vs ND 57 \u00b1 9 mm; P < .05) and proximal and iliac endograft fixation lengths were shorter (SD 18 \u00b1 8 mm vs ND 24 \u00b1 11 mm; P < .05 and SD 35 \u00b1 14 vs ND 42 \u00b1 16 mm; P < .05) in patients with sideways endograft displacement. There was no significant difference between the groups in AAA rupture and AAA-related death (one fatal AAA rupture, ND group). SD patients had a higher surgical conversion rate (10% vs 0%; P = .002), more secondary procedures (44% vs 6%; P < .001), more AAA sac enlargement (42% vs 10%; P < .001), more endograft migration (66% vs 5%; P < .001), and more type I or III endoleaks (36% vs 3%; P < .001).\nPositional stability of the endograft within the aneurysm sac is critical for the long-term success of EVAR. Sideways movement of the endograft within the aneurysm sac is associated with an increased risk of late adverse events.",

    "abstract": "Vascular surgery-related groin complications can lead to catastrophic outcomes and pose a significant healthcare burden. We have taken steps to reduce potential complications at the time of initial surgery by performing prophylactic muscle flaps. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and benefit of prophylactic flaps in high-risk patients.\nA retrospective cohort study was performed on patients undergoing open vascular surgery involving the femoral vessels through a groin incision between 2005 and 2010. Patients receiving prophylactic muscle flaps at their initial surgery were compared with those patients not receiving a flap (control).\nSixty-eight prophylactic flaps in 53 patients were compared with 195 open vascular procedures without flaps in 178 patients. The most frequent indication was reoperative bypass surgery with prosthetic reconstruction (63%). The prophylactic patient group exhibited significantly higher rates of comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25.0% vs 12.6%; P = .018) and hyperlipidemia (80.9% vs 59.1%; P = .002). Patients receiving prophylactic flaps had lower rates of overall complications (16.2% vs 50.3%; P < .001), infections (1.5% vs 38.5%; P < .001), seroma (0% vs 7.2%; P = .023), and lymphocele (1.5% vs 15.4%; P = .002). Multivariate regression demonstrated that obesity (odds ratio [OR], 2.1 [1.001-4.49]; P = .05), smoking (OR, 2.7 [1.37-5.16]; P = .004), reoperation (OR, 3.5 [1.41-8.63]; P = .007), and prosthetic graft reconstruction (OR, 2.0 [1.03-3.78]; P = .04) were associated with postoperative complications. Additionally, in analyzing all groin complications in all patients, we found that patients who received a prophylactic flap experienced significantly less groin wound complications (OR, 0.17; P < .001).\nComplications following open groin surgery are common, lead to significant morbidity, and are very costly. Performing prophylactic muscle flaps at the initial surgery to cover the femoral vessels and reduce dead space can significantly reduce complications in select high-risk patients. Prophylactic flaps are safe, effective, and should be considered in patients with multiple comorbidities undergoing high-risk groin surgery, such as reoperative prosthetic bypass surgery.",

    "abstract": "Opportunities are declining for residents to participate in complex open vascular surgical operations. Open simulation using fresh cadavers potentially can be used to familiarize residents with complex vascular exposures. We evaluated the use of fresh cadavers to assist resident comprehension of complex anatomic relationships in vascular surgery.\nTwenty-two postgraduate year (PGY) 3 (n = 12) and PGY 4 (n = 10) general surgery residents attended five structured 4-hour cadaver skills laboratories. Residents performed five conceptually difficult and infrequently encountered operative vascular exposures: the supraclavicular subclavian and vertebral arteries, supraceliac aorta, superior mesenteric artery, proximal and distal renal arteries, and common iliac artery bifurcations. Residents were tested (oral board examination style with percentage correct of a predetermined checklist) in their knowledge and understanding of the anatomic relationships before and after the cadaver laboratories. Participants' self-reported confidence in performing these complex vascular exposures was also measured before and after the course using the operative confidence score (1 = not confident; 5 = highly confident) for each exposure.\nParticipation in the course resulted in increases in participant comprehension and self-reported operative confidence in the supraclavicular subclavian and vertebral arteries, supraceliac aorta, superior mesenteric artery, renal arteries, and iliac bifurcation exposures. Before vs after the course, the mean oral examination scores were 5% vs 87%, 26% vs 94%, 19% vs 86%, 30% vs 88%, and 29% vs 87%, respectively (all P < .001), and mean operative confidence scores were 1.1 vs 2.9, 1.3 vs 3.5, 1.2 vs 3.2, 1.2 vs 3, and 1.5 vs 3.9, respectively (all P < 0.001).\nFresh cadaver laboratories can provide a learner-centered and safe environment for acquiring procedural understanding and operative confidence of complex vascular exposures.

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the proximal vertebral artery is an important cause of cerebrovascular ischemic events with a significant associated morbidity and mortality. Endovascular treatment has emerged as a promising tool of the therapeutic armamentarium, along with medical therapy and surgical reconstruction. Our objective was to systemically review the pertinent evidence on the endovascular management of proximal vertebral artery disease and perform an analysis of the published outcomes.\nA systematic review of the literature identified all studies reporting percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or stenting, or both, for proximal vertebral artery stenosis. Web-based search engines were searched using the Medical Subject Headings terms \"vertebral artery,\" \"angioplasty,\" and \"stents\" in all possible combinations. Studies comprising a series of at least five patients were considered for analysis. Periprocedural transient ischemic attack and stroke and death from any cause \u226430 days of treatment were defined as the primary outcome end points.\nOne randomized controlled trial comparing angioplasty and stenting of the proximal vertebral artery and medical therapy was identified.

    "abstract": "Despite advances in imaging techniques, mediastinoscopy remains an important tool for the staging of the mediastinum in non-small cell lung cancer and diagnosing lymphoma with mediastinal adenopathy. Injury to the arterial system during mediastinoscopy is infrequent but a potentially fatal complication. We report three cases of injury to the aorta and supra-aortic arteries sustained during mediastinoscopy. These were effectively managed by endovascular techniques. Patient recovery was uncomplicated and median length of stay was 3 days. This technique avoids major open surgery in a high-risk group of patients and may offer a mortality benefit and more rapid resumption of oncological treatment.",

    "abstract": "Thrombosis and restenosis remain problematic for many intravascular procedures. Previously, it has been demonstrated that modifying an injured vascular surface with a protein-reactive polymer could block undesirable platelet deposition. As an added benefit, it would be advantageous if one could target therapeutics to the injured site. This study investigates a site-specific delivery system to target microspheres to vascular surfaces modified with a reactive polyethylene glycol tagged with biotin.\nRabbit femoral arteries were injured with a 2F embolectomy catheter. Modification of the vascular surface was achieved using a channeled balloon catheter or small-diameter tube. Microspheres were injected intravenously through catheterization of the ear vein. Polymer modification on the injured surface and delivery of microspheres was quantified using epifluorescence microscopy at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours.\nPolymer modification of the vascular surface could be achieved using a channeled drug delivery catheter or small-diameter tube with similar results. Maximum polymer coverage occurred at 0 hours and decreased to 85% maximal at 24 hours, 72% at 48 hours, and 67% at 72 hours. The initial number of microspheres per mm(2) binding to modified, injured arteries was 304 versus 141 for the unmodified, damaged control (P < .01). At subsequent times, the number of adherent microspheres to modified, injured arteries decreased by 50%, 70%, and 84% at 24, 48, and 72 hours, respectively; while nonspecific binding to unmodified, injured arteries quickly decreased by 93%. Initial microsphere binding to modified, healthy arteries was 153 microspheres/mm(2) as opposed to 26 microspheres/mm(2) for the unmodified, healthy controls (P < .01).\nChemical modification of injured vessels following intravascular procedures can be readily accomplished in vivo to create a substrate for targeted delivery systems. As a proof of concept, targeted microspheres preferentially adhered to polymer-modified surfaces as opposed to injured, unmodified, or healthy vascular surfaces.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism underlying ischemic preconditioning (IPC) protection against spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is unclear. We investigated the role of spinal cord autoregulation in tolerance to spinal cord I/R injury induced by IPC in a rat model.\nSprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups. IPC (P) group animals received IPC by temporary thoracic aortic occlusion (AO) with a 2F Fogarty arterial embolectomy catheter (Baxter Healthcare, Irvine, Calif) for 3 minutes. The I/R injury (I/R) group animals were treated with blood withdrawal and temporary AO for 12 minutes, and shed blood reinfusion at the end of the procedures. The P+I/R animals received IPC, followed by 5 minutes reperfusion, and then I/R procedures for 12 minutes. Sham (S) group animals received anesthesia and underwent surgical preparation, but without preconditioning or I/R injury. Neurologic function on postprocedure days 1, 3, 5, and 7 was evaluated by Tarlov scoring. Lumbar segments were harvested for histopathologic examination on day 7. To evaluate the role of autoregulation in IPC, spinal cord blood flow and tissue oxygenation were continuously monitored throughout the procedure duration.\nThe Tarlov scores in the I/R group were significantly lower than those in the S, P, and P+I/R groups on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 (P < .001). No significant differences were noted between the S, P, and P+I/R groups. The numbers of surviving motor neurons in the S, P, and P+I/R groups were significantly higher than those in the I/R group (P < .001); however, the number of surviving motor neurons did not differ between the S, P, and P+I/R groups. The P group exhibited higher spinal cord blood flow (P = .001-.043) and tissue oxygenation (P = .032-.043) within the first 60 minutes after reperfusion than the S group. The P+I/R group exhibited higher spinal cord blood flow (P = .016-.045) and tissue oxygenation (P = .001-.038) within the first 60 minutes after reperfusion than the I/R group.\nIPC ameliorates spinal cord I/R injury in rats, probably mediated by triggering spinal cord autoregulation and improving local spinal cord blood flow and tissue oxygenation. This concept may be the new therapeutic targets in patients requiring aortic surgery.",

    "abstract": "We report the case of a 59-year-old man who developed a recurrent aortoenteric fistula (AEF) following previous aorto-bifemoral bypass grafting and subsequent AEF open repair with aorto-bifemoral graft excision and extra-anatomic reconstruction. The patient was treated emergently by means of endovascular plug deployment via a left brachial approach into the infrarenal aortic stump, obtaining recovery of hemodynamic stability. Five days later, he underwent elective relaparotomy, aortic plug removal, infrarenal aortic ligature, and duodenal repair. Endovascular strategies to rapidly stop bleeding associated with recurrent AEF may serve as a \"bridge\" to definitive open repair, as in the case discussed herein. Even if rare, recurrent AEF following previous prosthetic aortic graft excision and extra-anatomic revascularization represents a dreadful event. Since surgical treatment is technically demanding and time consuming in emergent settings, we present an \"unconventional\" endovascular option to obtain quick cessation of aortic bleeding.",

    "abstract": "Vascular endothelial cells serve as the first line of defense for end organs after ischemia and reperfusion injuries. The full etiology of this dysfunction is poorly understood, and valproic acid (VPA) has proven to be beneficial after traumatic injury. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism of action through which VPA exerts its beneficial effects.\nSixteen Yorkshire swine underwent a standardized protocol for an ischemia-reperfusion injury through hemorrhage and a supraceliac cross-clamp with ensuing 6-hour resuscitation. The experimental swine (n = 6), received VPA at cross-clamp application and were compared with a sham (n = 5) and injury-control models (n = 5). Aortic endothelium was harvested, and microarray analysis was performed along with a functional clustering analysis with gene transcript validation using relative quantitative polymerase chain reaction.\nClinical comparison of experimental swine matched for sex, weight, and length demonstrated that VPA significantly decreased resuscitative requirements, with improved hemodynamics and physiologic laboratory measurements. Six transcript profiles from the VPA treatment were compared with the 1536 gene transcripts (529 up and 1007 down) from sham and injury-control swine. Microarray analysis and a Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery functional pathway analysis approach identified biologic processes associated with pathologic vascular endothelial function, specifically through functional cluster pathways involving apoptosis/cell death and angiogenesis/vascular development, with five specific genes (THBS1, TNFRSF12A, ANGPTL4, RHOB, and RTN4) identified as members of both functional clusters. This study also examined gene expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, and TGF-\u03b2-releasing thrombospondin 1 [THBS1]) and genes expressing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) C, VEGFD, and VEGFR1 and found that these genes were involved in the endothelial functional preservation associated with VPA administration.\nVPA minimized pathologic endothelial cell function through the TGF-\u03b2 and VEGF functional pathways. This study also implicates that integrated functional modeling and analysis will enable advancements in endothelial dysfunction using a systems biology approach.",

Six transcript profiles from the VPA treatment were compared with the 1536 gene transcripts (529 up and 1007 down) from sham and injury-control swine. Microarray analysis and a Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery functional pathway analysis approach identified biologic processes associated with pathologic vascular endothelial function, specifically through functional cluster pathways involving apoptosis/cell death and angiogenesis/vascular development, with five specific genes (THBS1, TNFRSF12A, ANGPTL4, RHOB, and RTN4) identified as members of both functional clusters. This study also examined gene expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, and TGF-\u03b2-releasing thrombospondin 1 [THBS1]) and genes expressing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) C, VEGFD, and VEGFR1 and found that these genes were involved in the endothelial functional preservation associated with VPA administration.",

    "abstract": "Controlled hypotension is critical for precise deployment of endografts in the thoracic aorta and for safe balloon dilation after deployment. We describe a novel approach to rapid right ventricular pacing using a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) that is placed during the procedure for hemodynamic monitoring.\nThe study included 27 patients (20 men and seven women), with a mean age of 74 years, who underwent endograft placement in the thoracic aorta with PAC-directed rapid right ventricular pacing. Hemodynamic parameters, accuracy of deployment, complications related to rapid right ventricular pacing and PAC placement, presence of endoleaks, and postoperative complications were evaluated.\nPAC-directed rapid right ventricular pacing was performed during endograft deployment and balloon dilation after deployment without technical difficulty. Each patient underwent a median of two pacing episodes (range, 1-4). The length of each pacing episode was a mean of 11 seconds (range, 8-14 seconds). Mean pacing rate was 170 \u00b1 15 beats/min, which achieved an average mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 42 \u00b1 8 mm Hg. After pacing cessation, the recovery time of MAP to prepacing levels was <5 seconds (mean, 2 seconds) in all but one patient. All endografts were precisely deployed at a mean of 2 mm from the intended placement site, and there was no unintentional branch vessel coverage. One patient with severe valvular heart disease died. There were nine endoleaks, one postoperative stroke (4%), and one access wound hematoma (4%).\nPAC-directed rapid right ventricular pacing is an effective method of inducing hypotension, enabling precise thoracic endograft deployment and safe balloon dilation after deployment. However, despite these advantages, the technique may be contraindicated in patients with severe valvular or ischemic heart disease.",

    "abstract": "True and false lumen changes and patient outcomes following thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for patients with stable type B dissection have been described by the The Investigation of Stent Grafts in Aortic Dissection (INSTEAD) trial. However, these changes have not been described in TEVAR patients treated for complications of chronic dissection.\nA single-institution study was conducted of 73 prospectively evaluated patients treated for complications of chronic type B dissection from 2002 to 2010. Spiral computed tomography reconstructions using M2S (Medical Media Systems, West Lebanon, NH) were analyzed for sequential changes in aortic volume and diameter during patient follow-up. Changes in aortic volume and diameter were tabulated as a percent change from preoperative values. Patient outcomes were determined by sequential evaluations postprocedure.\nTEVAR was successfully performed in 72 out of the 73 patients (99%). Indications for intervention were aortic enlargement (n = 62), failure of medical management (n = 7), and perforation (n = 4). The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 14%; events were due to retrograde dissection (n = 4), cardiac-related (n = 4), and rupture (n = 2). Eleven out of the 72 patients (15%) required a secondary procedure for endoleak (n = 7) and persistent distal perfusion of the false lumen (n = 4). Mean percentage expansion of the thoracic true lumen was noted during the follow-up period: 38%, 46%, 71%, and 114% at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up, respectively. Concomitant regression of the thoracic false lumen of -65%, -68%, -84%, and -84% was observed at the same intervals, respectively. Patients with an initial extension of the thoracic dissection into the infrarenal aorta (n = 46) had an increase in mean percentage change of aortic diameter and volume to 21% and 17% at 1 year, respectively. By contrast, in the patient group without infrarenal dissection (n = 14), the infrarenal aortic diameter and volume remained relatively unchanged at 3% and -0.9%, respectively, at 1-year postintervention.\nTEVAR is a potential treatment option for patients experiencing complications of chronic type B dissection. During follow-up, there is a predictable expansion of the thoracic true lumen and regression of the thoracic false lumen. These findings correlate with those of the INSTEAD trial, which demonstrated false lumen regression and true lumen expansion in a cohort of patients with stable type B dissection. However, many patients with extension of thoracic dissection into the infrarenal aorta demonstrate continued aortic dilation and, on occasion, the need for secondary intervention for persistent distal perfusion. Further analysis is needed in this subgroup of patients so as to better determine potential predictors and the clinical significance of post-TEVAR infrarenal expansion. Moreover, further investigations may support a role for secondary endovascular intervention in remedying persistent infrarenal aortic expansion after TEVAR for chronic dissection.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the costs and comparative cost-effectiveness of two methods of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in the Open Versus Endovascular Repair (OVER) Veterans Affairs (VA) Cooperative Study, a multicenter randomized trial of 881 patients.\nThe primary outcomes of this analysis were mean total health care cost per life-year and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) from randomization to 2 years after. QALYs were calculated from EuroQol (EQ)-5D questionnaires collected at baseline and annually. Health care utilization data were obtained directly from patients and from national VA and Medicare data sources. VA costs were obtained from national VA sources using methods previously developed by the VA Health Economics Resource Center. Costs for non-VA care were determined from Medicare claims data or billing data from the patient's health care providers.\nAfter 2 years of follow-up, mean life-years were 1.78 in the endovascular repair group and 1.74 in the open repair group (difference, 0.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.03 to 0.09; P = .29). Mean QALYs were 1.462 in the endovascular group and 1.461 in the open group (difference adjusting for baseline EQ-5D score, 0.006; 95% CI, -0.038 to 0.052; P = .78). Mean graft costs were higher in the endovascular group ($14,052 vs $1363; P < .001), but length of stay was shorter (5.0 vs 10.5 days; P < .001), resulting in a lower mean cost of the hospital admission for the AAA procedure in the endovascular repair group of $37,068 vs $42,970 (difference, -$5901; 95% CI, -$12,135 to -$821; P = .04). After 2 years, total health care costs remained lower in the endovascular group, but the difference was no longer significant (-$5019; 95% CI, -$16,720 to $4928; P = .35). The probability of endovascular repair being less costly and more effective was 70.9% for life-years and 51.4% for QALYs.\nIn this multicenter randomized trial, endovascular AAA repair resulted in lower cost and better survival than open repair after the initial hospitalization for repair; but after 2 years, survival, quality of life, and costs were not significantly different between the two treatments.",

    "abstract": "Optimal selection of a revascularization strategy in femoropopliteal occlusive disease (FPOD) remains controversial. Among endovascular treatment options for FPOD, covered stent placement has become increasingly used. We sought to examine the influence of clinical, anatomic, and device-related characteristics on the clinical performance of these devices.\nThis was a retrospective, single-center study of consecutively treated limbs that underwent Viabahn (W. L. Gore, Flagstaff, Ariz) stent graft placement for FPOD from 2005 to 2010. Clinical, anatomic, and device-related characteristics were obtained from review of medical records and angiograms. End points were occurrence of any reintervention, major adverse limb event (eg, major amputation, thrombolysis/thrombectomy, or open bypass surgery), or thrombolysis/thrombectomy treatment alone. Univariate predictors were calculated and multivariate models constructed for each clinical end point using Cox proportional hazards models.\nThe study cohort included 87 limbs in 77 unique patients, with a median follow-up time of 382 days. The indication for intervention was claudication in 56%. In 25 cases (29%), the index procedure was a secondary intervention for FPOD, including treatment of in-stent restenosis in 22 cases (25%). Lesions treated included 45% TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II D and 58% chronic total occlusions. The observed Kaplan-Meier 1-year event rates for reintervention, major adverse limb event (MALE), and thrombolysis were 43%, 28%, and 17%, respectively. MALE occurred in 18 patients, nine of whom presented with acute limb ischemia; no patient underwent major amputation. Univariate predictors of negative outcomes included lack of dual-antiplatelet usage, advanced TASC II classification, smaller implant diameter, increased number of devices used, longer total implant length, and coverage of a patent distal collateral vessel. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of dual-antiplatelet usage was protective against all three outcomes, 5-mm device diameter was a risk factor for both reintervention and MALE, and the use of multiple devices and distal collateral coverage were significant risk factors for thrombolysis events.\nReintervention is common in the first year after Viabahn placement for FPOD, with more than half of the events being a MALE. Procedural factors such as antiplatelet therapy, stent graft diameter, implant length/number, and distal collateral coverage are strongly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. These factors should be carefully considered to optimize patient selection and intraoperative decision making for this procedure.",

    "abstract": "The femoral vein is increasingly utilized as a conduit in major arterial and venous reconstruction. However, perioperative complications, especially venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with femoral vein harvest (FVH), are not well described. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors for the development of symptomatic VTE in patients who undergo FVH.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent FVH over a 5-year period at a single institution. Patient clinical characteristics, indications for surgery, postoperative venous duplex scans, and computerized tomography scans of the chest were gathered and reviewed from an electronic medical record query. Statistical analysis was performed to determine which factors correlate with development of perioperative complications after FVH.\nThere were 57 patients (53% male; mean age, 62 years) who underwent 58 FVHs. Of the procedures, 53% were performed for arterial reconstruction and 47% for vascular reconstruction after cancer resection (85% portomesenteric reconstruction). Perioperative VTEs were diagnosed in 17 of 58 (29%) FVH procedures. Sixteen ipsilateral deep vein thromboses (DVTs) occurred distal to the FVH site and five (9%) occurred proximal to the FVH site. The incidence of VTE was significantly greater in patients with malignancy (52% vs 10%; P = .001), and 88% of all VTEs in this series were diagnosed in patients with cancer. All DVTs proximal to the FVH site and all DVTs in the contralateral extremity occurred in patients with malignancy. Pulmonary embolism occurred in two patients. No patients developed compartment syndrome or limb loss. Eight patients (14%) required FVH site wound debridement.\nVTE after FVH occurs more frequently in patients with malignancy. Aggressive and prolonged thromboprophylaxis and routine venous ultrasound surveillance are warranted after FVH in patients with malignancy.",

    "abstract": "The ideal hemostatic agent for treatment of suture-line bleeding at vascular anastomoses has not yet been established. This study evaluated whether the use of a fibrin sealant containing 500 IU/mL thrombin and synthetic aprotinin (FS; marketed in the United States under the name TISSEEL) is beneficial for treatment of challenging suture-line bleeding at vascular anastomoses of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts, including those further complicated by concomitant antiplatelet therapies.\nOver a 1-year period ending in 2010, ePTFE graft prostheses, including arterio-arterial bypasses and arteriovenous shunts, were placed in 140 patients who experienced suture-line bleeding that required treatment after completion of anastomotic suturing. Across 24 US study sites, 70 patients were randomized and treated with FS and 70 with manual compression (control). The primary end point was the proportion of patients who achieved hemostasis at the study suture line at 4 minutes after start of application of FS or positioning of surgical gauze pads onto the study suture line.\nThere was a statistically significant difference in the comparison of hemostasis rates at the study suture line at 4 minutes between FS (62.9%) and control (31.4%) patients (P < .0001), which was the primary end point. Similarly, hemostasis rates in the subgroup of patients on antiplatelet therapies were 64.7% (FS group) and 28.2% (control group). When analyzed by bleeding severity, the hemostatic advantage of FS over control at 4 minutes was similar (27.8% absolute improvement for moderate bleeding vs 32.8% for severe bleeding). Logistic regression analysis (accounting for gender, age, intervention type, bleeding severity, blood pressure, heparin coating of ePTFE graft, and antiplatelet therapies) found a statistically significant treatment effect in the odds ratio (OR) of meeting the primary end point between treatment groups (OR, 6.73; P < .0001), as well as statistically significant effects for intervention type (OR, 0.25; P = .0055) and bleeding severity (OR, 2.59; P = .0209). The safety profile of FS was excellent as indicated by the lack of any related serious adverse events.\nThe findings from this phase 3 study confirmed that FS is safe and its efficacy is superior to manual compression for hemostasis in patients with peripheral vascular ePTFE grafts. The data also suggest that FS promotes hemostasis independently of the patient's own coagulation system, as shown in a representative population of patients with vascular disease under single- or dual-antiplatelet therapies.",

    "abstract": "The published correlations between treadmill performance and the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) score are generally fair. We hypothesized that the slope of the relationship of maximal treadmill walking time to WIQ would be lower in older than in younger patients, resulting in (1) a fair correlation in the population considered as a whole and (2) different cutoff points of the WIQ score to predict the ability to complete 5 minutes of treadmill walking in different age groups.\nA 9-month prospective study was performed among patients referred for vascular-type claudication. Patients were divided into three age groups by years: <60 (group 1, n = 91), 60 to 70 (group 2, n = 80), and >70 (group 3, n = 77). Patients self-completed the WIQ, which was corrected with a nurse, if necessary, and then completed a treadmill test. We calculated the correlation coefficient and slope of the relationship between the WIQ and maximal treadmill walking time. We used receiver operating characteristics curve analysis to estimate the accuracy of the WIQ score to determine the ability of the patients to complete 5 minutes of treadmill walking.\nDifferences in slopes were significant between groups 1 vs 2 (P = .02), 2 vs 3 (P < .002), and 1 vs 3 (P < .001). The R(2) for the regression lines also tended to decrease but was only significant between two extremes (1 vs 2, P = .11; 2 vs 3, P = .07; 1 vs 3, P < .001). In patients aged <60 years (group 1), a WIQ score of 47 predicted the ability to complete a 5-minute test on treadmill with 86.8% accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.906; P < .001). The accuracy in predicting treadmill results from the WIQ score was fair in group 2 and nonsignificant in group 3.\nPrediction of treadmill walking capacity from the WIQ score should account for age. The TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus suggests that self-reported limitation has an equal weight as measured walking distance in the treatment choices and follow-up of patients with peripheral arterial disease. The WIQ should probably be used with caution in clinical routine, and constant-load treadmill testing is probably not the ideal candidate in elderly patients. New or adapted tools are likely needed in such patients but remain to be studied.",

The accuracy in predicting treadmill results from the WIQ score was fair in group 2 and nonsignificant in group 3.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine if there are sex-based differences in the inflammatory phenotype of patients undergoing lower extremity bypass (LEB) and if they correlate with clinical outcomes.\nThis was a retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort of 225 patients (161 men and 64 women) who underwent autogenous vein LEB between February 2004 and May 2008. Fasting baseline blood samples were obtained before LEB, and the inflammatory biomarkers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen were assessed. All patients underwent ultrasound graft surveillance. CRP levels were dichotomized at 5 mg/L and fibrinogen levels at 600 mg/dL.\nThere were no significant differences in age, race, history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus, body mass index, or coronary artery disease between men and women. Men were more likely to be current smokers (P = .02), have a history of hypercholesterolemia (P = .02), and be taking statins (P = .02). Women were more likely to present with critical limb ischemia (P = .03) and had higher median baseline CRP levels (5.15 mg/L; interquartile range [IQR], 1.51-18.62 mg/L) than men (2.70; IQR, 1.24-6.98 mg/L; P = .02). Median follow-up was 893 days (IQR, 539-1315 days). A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model for primary vein graft patency showed a significant interaction between sex and CRP (P = .03) and fibrinogen (P = .02). After adjustment for key covariates, primary vein graft patency was significantly less in women with CRP >5 mg/L compared with women with CRP <5 mg/L (P = .02). No such difference was seen in men (P = .95). Primary graft patency was also decreased in women with fibrinogen >600 mg/dL vs women with fibrinogen <600 mg/dL (P = .002); again, this pattern was not evident in men (P = .19).\nWomen undergoing LEB for advanced peripheral artery disease have a different inflammatory phenotype than men. Elevated baseline levels of CRP and fibrinogen are associated with inferior vein graft patency in women but not in men. These findings indicate an important interaction between sex and inflammation in the healing response of vein grafts for LEB. Women with elevated preoperative CRP and fibrinogen levels may benefit from more intensive postoperative graft surveillance protocols.",

    "abstract": "For peripheral arterial disease, infrainguinal bypass grafting (BPG) carries a higher perioperative risk compared with peripheral endovascular procedures. The choice between the open and endovascular therapies is to an extent dependent on the expected periprocedural risk associated with each. Tools for estimating the periprocedural risk in patients undergoing BPG have not been reported in the literature. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a calculator to estimate the risk of perioperative mortality \u226430 days of elective BPG.\nWe identified 9556 patients (63.9% men) who underwent elective BPG from the 2007 to 2009 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data sets. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with 30-day perioperative mortality. Bootstrapping was used for internal validation. The risk factors were subsequently used to develop a risk calculator.\nPatients had a median age of 68 years. The 30-day mortality rate was 1.8% (n = 170). Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified seven preoperative predictors of 30-day mortality: increasing age, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, chronic corticosteroid use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dependent functional status, dialysis dependence, and lower extremity rest pain. Bootstrapping was used for internal validation. The model demonstrated excellent discrimination (C statistic, 0.81; bias-corrected C statistic, 0.81) and calibration. The validated risk model was used to develop an interactive risk calculator using the logistic regression equation.\nThe validated risk calculator has excellent predictive ability for 30-day mortality in a patient after an elective BPG. It is anticipated to aid in surgical decision making, informed patient consent, preoperative optimization, and consequently, risk reduction.",

We compare perioperative mortality, midterm survival, and morbidity after EVAR and open surgical repair (OSR).\nRecords were retrospectively reviewed from May 2000 to September 2010 for repair of infrarenal rAAAs. Primary end points included perioperative mortality and midterm survival. Secondary end points included acute limb ischemia, length of stay, ventilator-dependent respiratory failure, myocardial infarction, renal failure, abdominal compartment syndrome, and secondary intervention. Statistical analysis was performed using the t-test, \u03c7(2) test, the Fisher exact test, and logistic regression calculations. Midterm survival was assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models.\nSeventy-four infrarenal rAAAs were repaired, 19 by EVAR and 55 by OSR. Despite increased age and comorbidity in the EVAR patients, perioperative mortality was 15.7% for EVAR, which was significantly lower than the 49% for OSR (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.74; P = .008). Midterm survival also favored EVAR (hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21-0.77; P = .028, adjusted for age and sex). Mean follow-up was 20 months, and 1-year survival was 60% for EVAR vs 45% for OSR. Mean length of stay for patients surviving >1 day was 10 days for EVAR and 21 days for OSR (P = .004). Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure was 5% in the EVAR group vs 42% for OSR (odds ratio, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01-0.62; P = .001).\nEVAR of rAAA has a superior perioperative survival advantage and decreased morbidity vs OSR. Although not statistically significant, overall survival favors EVAR. We recommend that EVAR be considered as the first-line treatment of rAAAs and practiced as the standard of care.",

    "abstract": "We sought to determine the safety and efficacy of two different treatment strategies for patients with primary infected aortic aneurysms, including antibiotic treatment alone and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with aggressive antibiotic treatment, as alternatives to the established treatment of open surgical repair.\nWe conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who were treated for infected aortic aneurysm without undergoing aortic resection from January 2000 to December 2010 at a single institution.\nA total of 40 patients underwent traditional open repair during the study period. Sixteen patients with infected aortic aneurysm (11 men; median age, 70; range, 44-80 years) were identified as not having undergone aortic resection during the 11 years reviewed in the study. Nine patients received antibiotic treatment only (group I) and seven patients underwent EVAR with aggressive antibiotic treatment (group II). Salmonella species were isolated from seven patients in group I, and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the remaining two patients. In group II, six patients had blood culture results showing Salmonella species and one patient had a blood culture result showing Escherichia coli. Group I (7 of 9 patients; 78%) had a higher hospital mortality rate than group II (0%; P = .003). Mean follow-up among survivors was 10 \u00b1 15 months (range, 1-37 months).

Treating an infected aortic aneurysm with antibiotics alone could not stop aneurysm expansion and eradicate the aortic infection before the aneurysm ruptures. For the patients with infected aortic aneurysms who have limited life expectancy and multiple comorbidities, EVAR with aggressive antibiotic treatment should be considered preferentially over antibiotic treatment alone.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze our experience of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in patients with traumatic aortic transection.\nThis was a single-center consecutive case series that was conducted at the Uppsala University Hospital, Tertiary Referral Center. There were a total of 17 consecutive patients undergoing TEVAR for traumatic thoracic aortic transection. All patients undergoing TEVAR for aortic transection were registered prospectively and their medical records were reviewed regarding technical details, mechanism of injury, and concomitant injuries. Long-term outcome was analyzed with respect to need for reintervention and survival.\nBetween 2001 and 2010, 17 patients underwent TEVAR for traumatic aortic injury. Median age was 42 years (range, 18-77 years), and 15 of 17 patients (88%) were men. Fourteen patients had been involved in motor vehicle accidents, two had fallen from heights, and one fell off a bicycle on a slope. In all cases, the aortic injury was located in the proximity of the origin of the left subclavian artery. All patients had concomitant injuries. In all patients, a single stent graft was sufficient to exclude the injured part of the aorta. The median cover length was 120 mm (range, 100-200 mm). In-hospital mortality was 24% (4 of 17 patients). One patient died perioperatively and three postoperatively, two from brain injuries and one from multiorgan failure. After a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 10-98 months), three patients underwent reintervention (18%), each patient only once; one for a type I endoleak, and two for pseudocoarctation secondary to stent graft infolding. Two were treated endovascularly, and one had a stent graft explantation.\nEndovascular repair allows rapid and minimally invasive therapy in patients with traumatic aortic injury with good technical results. The outcome is highly dependent on the severity of other concurrent injuries.",

Fourteen patients had been involved in motor vehicle accidents, two had fallen from heights, and one fell off a bicycle on a slope. In all cases, the aortic injury was located in the proximity of the origin of the left subclavian artery. All patients had concomitant injuries. In all patients, a single stent graft was sufficient to exclude the injured part of the aorta. The median cover length was 120 mm (range, 100-200 mm). In-hospital mortality was 24% (4 of 17 patients). One patient died perioperatively and three postoperatively, two from brain injuries and one from multiorgan failure. After a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 10-98 months), three patients underwent reintervention (18%), each patient only once; one for a type I endoleak, and two for pseudocoarctation secondary to stent graft infolding. Two were treated endovascularly, and one had a stent graft explantation.",

    "abstract": "To assess the influence of stent application on in-stent hemodynamics under standardized conditions.\nOvine common carotid arteries before and after stent (6 \u00d7 40 mm, sinus-Carotid-RXt, combined open-closed cell design; Optimed, Ettlingen, Germany) application were used. Plastic tubes, 10 mm in length, simulating stenosis were placed in the middle of the applied stent to induce different degrees of stenosis (moderate 57.8% and severe 76.4%). Flow velocity and dynamic compliance were, respectively, measured with ultrasound and laser scan; proximal, in-stent, and distal to the stented arterial segment (1 cm proximal and distal) in a pulsatile ex vivo circulation system.\nStent insertion caused the in-stent peak systolic velocity to increase 22% without stenosis, 31% with moderate stenosis, and 23% with severe stenosis. Stent insertion without stenosis caused no significant increase in in-stent end-diastolic velocity (EDV) but a 17% increase with moderate stenosis. In severe stenosis, EDV was increased 56% proximal to the stenosis. Compliance was reduced threefold in the middle of the stented arterial segment where flow velocity was significantly increased.\nWith or without stenosis, stent introduction caused the in-stent peak systolic velocity to become significantly elevated compared with a nonstented area. EDV was also increased by stent insertion in the case of moderate stenosis. The stent-induced compliance reduction may be causal for the increase in flow velocity since the stent-induced flow velocity elevation appeared in the stented area with low compliance. Because of altered hemodynamics caused by stent introduction when measured by duplex ultrasound, caution is prudent in concluding that carotid artery stenting is associated with a higher restenosis rate than carotid endarterectomy. Mistakenly upgrading moderate to severe restenosis could result in unnecessary reintervention.\nClinical experience and prior studies support the supposition that restenosis after carotid artery stenting in carotid lesions displays erroneously elevated velocity when evaluated by duplex ultrasound (DUS), thus contributing to misleading interpretation of the degree of stenosis. This study, in contrast to studies of other groups, employs exactly the same conditions to measure flow with DUS in an unstented and then stented section of the carotid artery. Since DUS is the first-choice tool for carotid artery evaluation, knowledge about inexactness of the method is essential to avoid errors in treatment or follow-up decisions.",

    "abstract": "Current Canadian and international guidelines suggest patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or nondisabling stroke and ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis of 50% to 99% should be offered carotid endarterectomy (CEA) \u2264 2 weeks of the incident TIA or stroke. The objective of the study was to identify whether these goals are being met and the factors that most influence wait times.\nPatients who underwent CEA at the Ottawa Hospital for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis from 2008 to 2010 were identified. Time intervals based on the dates of initial symptoms, referral to and visit with a vascular surgeon, the decision to operate, and the date of surgery were recorded for each patient. The influence of various factors on wait times was explored, including age, sex, type of index event, referring physician, distance from the surgical center, degree of stenosis, and surgeon assigned.\nOf the 117 patients who underwent CEA, 92 (78.6%) were symptomatic. The median time from onset of symptoms to surgery for all patients was 79 days (interquartile range [IQR], 34-161). The shortest wait times were observed in stroke patients (49 [IQR, 27-81] days) and inpatient referrals (66 [IQR, 25-103] days). Only 7 of the 92 symptomatic patients (8%) received care within the recommended 2 weeks. The median surgical wait time for all patients was 14 days (IQR, 8-25 days). In the multivariable analysis, significant predictors of longer wait times included retinal TIA (P = .003), outpatient referrals (P = .004), and distance from the center (P = .008). Patients who presented to the emergency department had the shortest delays in seeing a vascular surgeon and subsequently undergoing CEA (P < .0001). There was no difference between surgeons for wait times to be seen in the clinic; however, there were significant differences among surgeons once the decision was made to proceed with CEA.\nOur wait times for CEA currently do not fall within the recommended 2-week guideline nor does it appear feasible within the current system. Important factors contributing to delays include outpatient referrals, living farther from the hospital, and presenting with a retinal TIA (amaurosis fugax). Our findings also suggest better scheduling practices once a decision is made to operate can modestly improve overall and surgical wait times for CEA.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed changes in the calf muscle deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) level during light-intensity exercise after ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) for superficial venous insufficiency.\nUGFS with 1% or 3% polidocanol foam (POL-F) was used to treat unilateral great saphenous vein reflux in 84 patients. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to measure calf muscle HHb levels before and 3 months after UGFS. The calf venous HHb blood-filling index was calculated on standing, the calf venous HHb ejection index was obtained after one tiptoe movement, and the venous HHb retention index was obtained after 10 tiptoe movements. The primary end point was an evident improvement in calf muscle deoxygenation after UGFS. The secondary end point was obliteration of the great saphenous vein.\nTreatment consisted of 1% POL-F in 48 limbs and 3% POL-F in the remaining 36. Ultrasound imaging at the 3-month follow-up demonstrated complete occlusion in 56.3% of the patients who received injections of 1% POL-F and in 66.7% of those who received injections of 3% POL-F. The difference in treatment outcome between the groups was not significant (P=.333). Reflux was absent in 39 limbs (81.3%) treated with 1% POL-F and in 34 limbs (94.4%) treated with 3% POL-F, and no significant difference was observed between the two groups (P=.076). Postsclerotherapy NIRS demonstrated significant reductions in the levels of the HHb filling index in both treatment groups (P=.039, P=.0001, respectively) and significant reductions in the levels of the HHb retention index (P<.0001, P=.008, respectively). However, the differences in the levels of the HHb ejection index before and after UGFS were not significant (P=.250, P=.084, respectively).\nOur present findings suggest that changes in the values of these parameters may be of potential use for assessing the effects of foam sclerotherapy in patients with superficial venous insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe the results of an alternative technique for inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) retrieval that can be used when the retrieval hook cannot be snared.\nRetrospective review of all patients undergoing attempted IVCF retrieval by a single surgeon between March 2009 and March 2011 was undertaken. After December 2009, in cases where the retrieval hook could not be snared, an 18F/85 cm sheath was inserted into the internal jugular vein and a Bentson wire (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) and snare were advanced across separate interstices of the filter. The resulting \"lasso\" was pulled up below the collar at the top of the filter, and the filter collapsed into the sheath.\nOver 28 months, 34 patients underwent attempted retrieval of G\u00fcnther Tulip filters (Cook Medical). Patients were 44\u00b115 years old; 59% were women (n=20). Filters were placed for venous thromboembolism with contraindication to anticoagulation in seven cases and prophylactically in 27 cases. Of the prophylactic cases, 18 (67%) were placed before planned bariatric surgery. Before December 2009, the success rate was 86% (6 of 7): the retrieval hook of one filter could not be snared and seemed to be embedded in the wall of the cava. After adoption of the described technique, the success rate was 96% (26 of 27): one patient refused further attempts at central venous catheterization after multiple unsuccessful attempts. Filters retrieved conventionally by snaring the hook (n=18) were implanted on average for 4.8\u00b13.7 months and 12.1\u00b110.1 months for those retrieved using the new technique (n=14; P=.02). All patients were discharged on the day of the procedure without complication. The one patient in whom the retrieval hook could not be snared before December 2009 has refused another attempt at retrieval.\nThe method of IVCF retrieval described here was successful in every instance in which it was attempted. It was associated with no morbidity despite the customary use of an 18F sheath in the internal jugular vein. The approach constitutes an appropriate \"fall-back\" technique when the retrieval hook of a removable IVCF cannot be snared.",

Before December 2009, the success rate was 86% (6 of 7): the retrieval hook of one filter could not be snared and seemed to be embedded in the wall of the cava. After adoption of the described technique, the success rate was 96% (26 of 27): one patient refused further attempts at central venous catheterization after multiple unsuccessful attempts. Filters retrieved conventionally by snaring the hook (n=18) were implanted on average for 4.8\u00b13.7 months and 12.1\u00b110.1 months for those retrieved using the new technique (n=14; P=.02). All patients were discharged on the day of the procedure without complication. The one patient in whom the retrieval hook could not be snared before December 2009 has refused another attempt at retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Several published studies have reported differing results of renal duplex ultrasound (RDU) imaging in detecting significant renal artery stenosis (RAS) using different Doppler parameters. This study is the largest to date to compare RDU imaging vs angiography and assess various published Doppler criteria.\nRDU imaging and angiography were both done in 313 patients (606 renal arteries). RAS was classified as normal, <60%, \u2265 60% to 99%, and occlusion. Main outcome measurements included renal peak systolic velocity (PSV), systolic renal-to-aortic ratio (RAR), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), and kidney lengths.\nThe mean PSVs and RARs for normal, <60%, and \u2265 60% stenosis were 173, 236, and 324 cm/s (P < .0001), and 2.2, 2.9, and 4.5, respectively (P < .0001). The PSV cutoff value that provided the best overall accuracy for \u2265 60% stenosis was 285 cm/s, with a sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 67%, 90%, and 81%, respectively. The RAR cutoff value with the best overall accuracy for \u2265 60% stenosis was 3.7, with a sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 69%, 91%, and 82%, respectively. A PSV of \u2265 180 cm/s and RAR of \u2265 3.5 had a sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 72%, 81%, and 78% in detecting \u2265 60% stenosis. A PSV of \u2265 200 cm/s with an RAR of \u2265 3.5 had a sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 72%, 83%, and 78% in detecting \u2265 60% stenosis. A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the PSV and RAR were better than the EDV in detecting \u2265 60% stenosis: PSV area under the curve (AUC) was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.88), EDV AUC was 0.71, and RAR AUC was 0.82 (PSV vs EDV, P < .0001; PSV vs RAR, P = .075; EDV vs RAR, P < .0001). A PSV of 285 cm/s or RAR of 3.7 alone were better than any combination of PSVs, EDVs, or RARs in detecting \u2265 60% stenosis. The mean kidney length was 10.4 cm in patients with \u2265 60% stenosis vs 11.0 cm in patients with <60% stenosis (P < .0001). Twelve percent of patients with \u2265 60% stenosis had a kidney length of \u2264 8.5 cm vs 4% in patients with <60% stenosis (P = .0003), and 5.6% (34 of 606) had accessory renal arteries on angiography, with six detected on RDU imaging. The presence of accessory renal arteries, solitary kidneys, or renal fibromuscular dysplasia had no influence on overall accuracy of using PSV values for detecting \u2265 60% stenosis.\nA PSV of 285 cm/s or an RAR of 3.7 alone can be used in detecting \u2265 60% RAS. Previously published data must be validated in individual vascular laboratories.",

    "abstract": "The impact of geographic isolation on abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) care in the United States is unknown. It has been postulated but not proven that rural patients have less access to endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), vascular surgeons, and high-volume treatment centers than their urban counterparts, resulting in inferior AAA care. The purpose of this study was to compare the national experience for treatment of intact AAA for patients living in rural areas or towns with those living in urban areas.\nPatients who underwent intact AAA repair in 2005 to 2006 were identified from a standard 5% random sample of all Medicare beneficiaries. Data on patient demographics, comorbidities, type of repair, and specialty of operating surgeon were collected. Hospitals were stratified into quintiles by yearly AAA volume. Primary outcomes included 30-day mortality and rehospitalization.\nA total of 2616 patients had repair for intact AAA (40% open, 60% EVAR). Patients from rural and urban areas were equally likely to receive EVAR (rural 60% vs urban 61%; P = .99) and be treated by a vascular surgeon (rural 48% vs urban 50%; P = .82). Most rural patients (86%) received care in urban centers. Primary outcomes occurred in 11.6% of rural patients (1.3% 30-day mortality; 10.3% rehospitalization) vs 16.0% of urban patients (3% 30-day mortality, 13% rehospitalization; P = .04). In multivariate analyses, rural residence was independently associated with treatment at high-volume centers (odds ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-2.01; P < .0001) and decreased death or rehospitalization (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.97; P = .03).\nDespite geographic isolation, patients in rural areas needing treatment for intact AAAs have equivalent access to EVAR and vascular surgeons, increased referral to high-volume hospitals, and improved outcomes after repair. This suggests that urban patients may be disadvantaged even with nearby access to high-quality centers. This study supports the need for criteria that define centers of excellence to extend the benefit of regionalization to all patients.",

    "abstract": "During endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), blood is trapped in the aneurysm sac at the moment the endograft is deployed. It is generally assumed that this blood will coagulate and evolve into an organized thrombus. It is unknown whether this process always occurs, what its time span is, and how it influences aneurysm shrinkage. With magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), quantitative analysis of the aneurysm sac is possible in terms of endoleak volume as well as unorganized thrombus volume and organized thrombus volume. We investigated the presence of unorganized thrombus in nonshrinking aneurysms years after EVAR.\nFourteen patients with a nonshrinking aneurysm without endoleak on computed tomography/computed tomography angiography underwent MRI with a blood pool agent (gadofosveset trisodium). Precontrast T1-, precontrast T2-, and postcontrast T1-weighted images (3 and 30 minutes after injection) were acquired and evaluated for the presence of endoleak. The aneurysm sac was segmented into endoleak, unorganized thrombus, and organized thrombus by interactively thresholding the differently weighted images. The classification was visualized in real-time as a color overlay on the MR images. The volumes of endoleak, unorganized thrombus, and organized thrombus were calculated.\nMedian time after EVAR was 2 years (range, 1-8.2 years). The average aneurysm sac volume of the patients was 167 \u00b1 107 mL (mean \u00b1 standard deviation). Nine patients had an endoleak on the postcontrast T1-w images 30 minutes after injection. On average, the aneurysm sac contained 78 \u00b1 61 mL unorganized thrombus, which corresponded to 51 \u00b1 21 volume-percentage, irrespective of the presence of an endoleak on the blood pool agent enhanced MRI images (independent t-test, P = .8).\nIn our study group, half of the nonshrinking aneurysm sac contents consisted of unorganized thrombus years after EVAR.",

    "abstract": "The present randomized double-blind multicenter study was designed to assess the efficacy of a progressive compressive stocking (new concept with maximal pressure at calf), compared to a degressive compressive stocking graded 30 mm Hg, evaluating the improvement of lower leg symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) in ambulatory patients with moderate to severe chronic venous disease.\nBoth gender outpatients presenting symptomatic moderate to severe CVI were eligible for a treatment by compressive stockings. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either degressive compressive stockings (30 mm Hg at ankle, 21 mm Hg at upper calf) or progressive compressive stockings (10 mm Hg at ankle, 23 mm Hg at upper calf). The primary outcome, evaluated after 3 months, was a composite success outcome, including improvement of pain or heavy legs without onset of either ulcer, deep or superficial vein thrombosis of the lower limbs, or pulmonary embolism. The ease of application of the compressive stockings reported by patients was one of secondary outcome.\nOverall, 401 patients (199 in the progressive compressive stocking group and 202 in the degressive compressive stocking group) were randomized by 44 angiologists in France. Among them, 66% were classified in the C3 CEAP category. The rate of success was significantly higher in the progressive compressive stocking group compared to the degressive compressive stocking group (70.0% vs 59.6%; relative risk, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.37; P = .03). This was mainly due to more frequent symptom improvement in the progressive compressive stocking group. The compressive stockings were considered easy to apply by 81.3% of patients in the progressive compressive stocking group vs 49.7% of patients in the degressive compressive stocking group (P < .0001). The rate of related serious adverse events was low and similar in both groups.\nThis trial has demonstrated that progressive compressive stockings are more effective than usual degressive compressive stockings in the improvement of pain and lower leg symptoms in patients with CVI. Moreover, progressive compressive stockings were easier to apply, raising no safety concern at 3 months.",

Among them, 66% were classified in the C3 CEAP category. The rate of success was significantly higher in the progressive compressive stocking group compared to the degressive compressive stocking group (70.0% vs 59.6%; relative risk, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.37; P = .03). This was mainly due to more frequent symptom improvement in the progressive compressive stocking group. The compressive stockings were considered easy to apply by 81.3% of patients in the progressive compressive stocking group vs 49.7% of patients in the degressive compressive stocking group (P < .0001). The rate of related serious adverse events was low and similar in both groups.",

Vascular access outcomes remain contradictory and understudied across different elderly populations. We hypothesized age might influence primary autogenous fistula use and outcomes in a predominantly diabetic multiethnic Asian ESRD population.\nDemographic and clinical factors affecting fistula patency and maturation were retrospectively compared among patients with incident ESRD aged <65 and \u226565 years at a single center. Fistula patency was estimated by Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank test comparison.\nWe analyzed 280 primary fistulas (59% radiocephalic, 33% brachiocephalic, and 8% brachiobasilic) in this cohort consisting of 31.8% aged \u226565 years, 50% Chinese, 39% Malay, 42% women, and 70% diabetic. One- and 2-year primary and secondary patency in patients aged <65 vs \u226565 years were comparable: 41.3% vs 36.7% and 28.7% vs 24.4% (P = .547) and 57.7% vs 56.8% and 47.1% vs 47.2% (P = .990). On multivariate analysis, only non-Chinese, dialysis initiation with tunneled catheters, and surgical/endovascular interventions affected fistula survival hazard ratios (HR): 0.622 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43-1.00), 0.549 (95% CI, 0.297-0.841), and 2.503 (95% CI, 1.695-3.697), respectively. Nonmaturation and intervention rates were also similar at 56.7% vs 61.8% and 34% vs 32.2% at 3 and 6 months and 0.31 vs 0.36 per access year, respectively (P > .05). Females and tunneled catheters were the only risk factors for nonmaturation (HR, 1.568; 95% CI, 1.148-1.608, and HR, 1.623; 95% CI, 1.400-1.881, respectively).\nA primary fistula strategy in incident elderly ESRD is feasible and does not result in inferior outcomes. Age should therefore not be a determinant for primary fistula creation.",

    "abstract": "Outcomes following transcatheter interventions at vascular and general surgery teaching hospitals (STH) are unknown. We examine whether surgery training programs influence clinically relevant outcomes after commonly performed endovascular procedures.\nUsing an all-payer inpatient care database from 2008, we selected adults who underwent either endovascular carotid stenting, endografting of descending thoracic aortic aneurysm, endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, or peripheral arterial revascularization. Patients were stratified by procedures completed at Surgery Teaching (Participate in Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education [ACGME]-accredited vascular and general surgery programs), STH, or nonteaching hospitals (NTH). Hierarchical regression models assessed adverse outcomes and in-hospital mortality among groups.\nOf the 175,698 records, 44% of the patients were treated at STH, while 56% underwent procedures at NTH. The adjusted odds ratio of any complication or mortality at STH and NTH were similar. Transfers, weekend admissions, and nonelective cases were higher at STH (P < .001, respectively). Paradoxically, STH treated fewer patients with more than three comorbidities compared with NTH (STH: 47% vs NTH: 53%; P < .001). Surgical teaching status did not lower the adjusted odds of mortality for any procedure. Moreover, the occurrence of any complication (adjusted odds ratios, 0.9; 95% confidence interval, .82-1.14; P = .69) and mortality (adjusted odds ratios, 0.9; 95% confidence interval, .74-1.22; P = .67) were equivalent between vascular and general STH.\nFollowing commonly performed transcatheter vascular procedures, and despite more transfers, weekend admissions, and nonelective procedures completed at STH, complications, and mortality were comparable across centers.",

    "abstract": "Although large randomized studies have established the efficacy and safety of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and, recently, carotid artery stenting (CAS), the under-representation of women in these trials leaves the comparison of risks to benefits of performing these procedures on women an open question. To address this issue, we reviewed the hospital outcomes and delineated patient characteristics predicting outcome in women undergoing carotid interventions using New York and Florida statewide hospital discharge databases.\nWe analyzed in-hospital mortality, postoperative stroke, cardiac postoperative complications, and combined postoperative stoke and mortality in 20,613 CEA or CAS hospitalizations for the years 2007 to 2009. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses of variables were performed.\nCEA was performed in 16,576 asymptomatic and 1744 symptomatic women and CAS in 1943 asymptomatic and 350 symptomatic women. Compared with CAS, CEA rates, in asymptomatic vs symptomatic, were significantly lower for in-hospital mortality (0.3% vs 0.8% and 0.4% vs 3.4%), stroke (1.5% vs 2.6% and 3.5% vs 9.4%), and combined stroke/mortality (1.7% vs 3.1% and 3.8% vs 10.9%). In cohorts matched by propensity scores, the same trend favoring CEA remained significant in symptomatic women. There was no difference in cardiac complication rates among asymptomatic women, but among symptomatic woman cardiac complications were more frequent after CAS (10.6% vs 6.5%; P = .0077). Among symptomatic women, the presence of renal disease, coronary artery disease, or age \u226580 years increased the risk of CAS over CEA threefold for the composite end point of stroke or death. For asymptomatic women only in those with coronary artery disease or diabetes, there was a statistical difference in the composite mortality/stroke rates favoring CEA (1.9% vs 3.3% and 1.7% vs 3.4%, respectively). After adjusting for relevant clinical and demographic risk factors and hospital annual volume, for CAS vs CEA, the risk of the composite end point of stroke or mortality was 1.7-fold higher in symptomatic and 3.4-fold higher in asymptomatic patients. Medicaid insurance, symptomatic patient, history of cancer, and presence of heart failure on admission were among other strong predictors of composite stroke/mortality outcome.\nDatabases reflecting real-world practice performance and management of carotid disease in women suggest that CEA compared with CAS has overall better perioperative outcomes in women. Importantly, CAS is associated with significantly higher morbidity in certain clinical settings and this should be taken into account when choosing a revascularization procedure.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the practice and outcomes of CAS and CEA in a real world setting.\nThis is a retrospective analysis of 7649 CEA and 430 CAS performed at 17 centers from 2003 to 2010 within the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE). The primary outcome measures were (1) any in-hospital stroke or death and (2) any stroke, death, or myocardial infarction (MI). Patients undergoing CEA in conjunction with cardiac surgery were excluded. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of stroke or death in patients undergoing CAS.\nCEA was performed in 17 centers by 111 surgeons, while CAS was performed in 6 centers by 30 surgeons and 8 interventionalists. Patient characteristics varied by procedure. Patients undergoing CAS had a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and prior ipsilateral CEA. Embolic protection was used in 97% of CAS. Shunts were used in 48% and patches in 86% of CEA. The overall in-hospital stroke or death rate was higher among patients undergoing CAS (2.3% vs 1.1%; P = .03). Overall stroke, death, or MI (2.8% CAS vs 2.1% CEA; P = .32) were not different. Asymptomatic patients had similar rates of stroke or death (CAS 0.73% vs CEA 0.89%; P = .78) and stroke, death, or MI (CAS 1.1% vs CEA 1.8%; P = .40). Symptomatic patients undergoing CAS had higher rates of stroke or death (5.1% vs 1.6%; P = .001), and stroke, death, or MI (5.8% vs 2.7%; P = .02). By multivariate analysis, major stroke (odds ratio, 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-10.8), minor stroke (2.7; CI, 1.5-4.8), prior ipsilateral CEA (3.2, CI, 1.7-6.1), age >80 (2.1; CI, 1.3-3.4), hypertension (2.6; CI, 1.0-6.3), and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.6; CI, 1.0-2.4) were predictors of stroke or death in patients undergoing carotid revascularization.\nIn our regional vascular surgical practices, the overall outcomes of CAS and CEA are similar for asymptomatic patients. However, symptomatic patients treated with CAS are at a higher risk for stroke or death.",

    "abstract": "Perioperative infection of an aortic graft is one of the most devastating complications of vascular surgery, with a mortality rate of 10% to 30%. The rate of amputation of the lower limbs is generally >25%, depending on the graft material, the location of the graft and infection, and the bacterial virulence. In vitro studies suggest that an antibiotic-impregnated graft may help prevent perioperative graft infection. In a pilot animal study, we tested a locally developed technique of bonding Dacron aortic grafts with three antimicrobial agents to evaluate the ensuing synergistic preventive effect on direct perioperative bacterial contamination.\nWe surgically implanted a 6-mm vascular knitted Dacron graft in the infrarenal abdominal aorta of six Sinclair miniature pigs. Two pigs received unbonded, uninoculated grafts; two received unbonded, inoculated grafts; and two received inoculated grafts that were bonded with chlorhexidine, rifampin, and minocycline. Before implantation, the two bonded grafts and the two unbonded grafts were immersed for 15 minutes in a 2-mL bacterial solution containing 1 to 2 \u00d7 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213). Two weeks after graft implantation, the pigs were euthanized, and the grafts were surgically excised for clinical, microbiologic, and histopathologic study.\nThe two bonded grafts treated with S aureus showed no bacterial growth upon explant, whereas the two unbonded grafts treated with S aureus had high bacterial counts (6.25 \u00d7 10(6) and 1.38 \u00d7 10(7) CFU/graft). The two control grafts (unbonded and untreated) showed bacterial growth (1.8 \u00d7 10(3) and 7.27 \u00d7 10(3) CFU/graft) that presumably reflected direct, accidental perioperative bacterial contamination; S cohnii ssp urealyticus and S chromogenes, but not S aureus, were isolated. The histopathologic and clinical data confirmed the microbiologic findings. Only pigs that received unbonded grafts showed histopathologic evidence of a perigraft abscess.\nOur results suggest that bonding aortic grafts with this triple antimicrobial combination is a promising method of reducing graft infection resulting from direct postoperative bacterial contamination for at least 2 weeks. Further studies are needed to explore the ability of this novel graft to combat one of the most feared complications in vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed outcomes of revascularization strategies in young patients with premature arterial disease.\nLower extremity revascularization outcomes from 2000 to 2008 were retrospectively compared among consecutive patients with comparable indications and procedures: age <50 years (group A) at the time of revascularization, 51 to 60 years (group B), and >60 years (control group C). Patency, limb salvage, and survival by limb or patient level were assessed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses.\nA total of 409 limbs in 298 patients were treated: 44% for claudication and 56% for critical limb ischemia (CLI). Group A patients were more likely to be smokers and have a hypercoagulable state but less likely to have diabetes and renal failure. Treatment indications were comparable among groups, and procedures were equally distributed between open surgical and endovascular interventions. Two perioperative deaths occurred in group C (2%). Mean follow-up was 29 months, and 16% of claudicant patients in group A progressed to CLI (B, 3%; C, 2%; P < .001). Overall, 2-year primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency were significantly lower in group A (50.5%, 65.2%, 68.2%; P = .045) vs B (65.7%, 81.4%, 86.8%; P = .01) and C (57.9%, 78.9%, 83.9%; P < .001). Claudicant patients in group A had an unexpectedly low 2-year freedom from major amputation after intervention of only 90%. Results were more comparable across groups for CLI. The 2-year freedom from reintervention was similar (A, 81.0%; B, 78.9%; C, 83.5%), irrespective of the indication for intervention (P = .60). Younger patients had a significantly higher 3-year survival (A, 89.5%; B, 85.3%) compared with patients aged >60 years (C, 71.4%; P = .005). The 2-year freedom from major amputation rate was significantly lower in claudicant patients in group A vs C undergoing endovascular revascularization (P = .002), but not in patients treated with open revascularization (P = .40). Predictors of loss of primary patency included age <50 years (P = .003), endovascular revascularization (P = .005), and progression from claudication to CLI (P < .001). Age <50 years was also an independent predictor of limb loss vs age >60 years (P = .05).\nEndovascular options are commonly being used in young patients, especially those with claudication, but patency rates and outcomes remain very poor.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have correlated increasing great saphenous vein (GSV) diameter with increasing CEAP clinical classification. Some insurance carriers are currently using specific GSV diameters to determine coverage for treatment of axial venous insufficiency. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of patient quality of life (QOL) measures with GSV diameters in varicose vein patients with GSV reflux.\nData were collected from the records of 91 patients prospectively enrolled in two varicose vein trials. The patients had symptomatic varicose veins with saphenofemoral junction and proximal GSV reflux. Maximum GSV diameter was measured on duplex ultrasound imaging, with the patient standing, within 5 cm of the saphenofemoral junction. Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire 2 (CIVIQ-2; Servier, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France), Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study (VEINES) Symptom (Sym) and QOL assessments, and the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) assessment were completed before treatment of GSV insufficiency. Demographic information, patient weight, height, and body mass index were collected. Correlations between pairs of data were done using Pearson product-moment and Spearman correlation coefficients.\nThe 91 study patients (19 men, 72 women) were a mean age of 45 years (range, 18-65 years). The mean GSV diameter was 6.7 mm (range, 2.2-14.1 mm). The mean VCSS score was 7.8 (range, 3-12). There was a weak correlation between increasing GSV diameter and VCSS (r=0.23; P=.03) and no correlation between GSV diameter and the CIVIQ-2 score (r=0.01), VEINES-QOL (r=-0.07), and VEINES-Sym (r=-0.1).\nGSV diameter is a poor surrogate marker for assessing the effect of varicose veins on a patient's QOL; thus, using GSV diameter as a sole criterion for determining medical necessity for the treatment of GSV reflux is inappropriate. Further correlations between QOL measures and duplex-derived objective findings are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Computational fluid dynamics, which uses numeric methods and algorithms for the simulation of blood flow by solving the Navier-Stokes equations on computational meshes, is enhancing the understanding of disease progression in type III aortic dissections. To illustrate this, we examined the changes in patient-derived geometries of aortic dissections, which showed progressive false lumen aneurysmal dilatation (26% diameter increase) during follow-up. Total pressure was decreased by 29% during systole and by 34% during retrograde flow. At the site of the highest false lumen dilatation, the temporal average of total pressure decreased from 45 to 22 Pa, and maximal average wall shear stress decreased from 0.9 to 0.4 Pa. These first results in the study of disease progression of type III DeBakey aortic dissection with computational fluid dynamics are encouraging.",

    "abstract": "Health care reform is forcing \"alignment\" between hospitals and physicians. The acceleration of employment of physicians by hospitals is bringing into focus contractual terms where compensation is tied to clinical productivity. Physician productivity is being almost entirely defined by work relative value units (WRVUs). However, vascular surgeons may bring value to a health system in ways that are unique and separate from clinical revenue as measured by WRVUs. Incentives for physicians should also be tied to behaviors that are desired, such as quality of care, efficiency, patient outcomes, patient satisfaction scores, teaching, and research, depending on the specific environment. Vascular surgeons must be aware of proper use and misuse of WRVUs and have access to the most appropriate benchmarks in negotiations for employment. With increasing employment of physicians by hospitals and focus on \"alignment,\" a more comprehensive measure of physician productivity is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) occur most commonly in elderly individuals, who are often suboptimal candidates for open repair because of significant comorbidities. The availability of a hybrid option, including open visceral debranching with endovascular aneurysm exclusion, may have advantages in these patients who are at high-risk for conventional repair. This report details the evolution of our technique and results with complete visceral debranching and endovascular aneurysm exclusion for TAAA repair in high-risk patients.\nBetween March 2005 and June 2011, 47 patients (51% women) underwent extra-anatomic debranching of all visceral vessels, followed by aneurysm exclusion by endovascular means at a single institution. A median of four visceral vessels were bypassed. The debranching procedure was initially performed through a partial right medial visceral rotation approach, leaving the left kidney posterior in the first 22 patients, and in the last 25 by a direct anterior approach to the visceral vessels. The debranching and endovascular portions of the procedure were performed in a single operation in the initial 33 patients and as a staged procedure during a single hospital stay in the most recent 14.\nMedian patient age was 71.0 \u00b1 9.8 years. All had significant comorbidity and were considered suboptimal candidates for conventional repair: 55% had undergone previous aortic surgery, 40% were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 4, and baseline serum creatinine was 1.5 \u00b1 1.3 mg/dL. The 30-day/in-hospital rates of death, stroke, and permanent paraparesis/plegia were 8.5%, 0%, and 4.3%, respectively, but 0% in the most recent 14 patients undergoing staged repair. These patients had significantly shorter combined operative times (314 vs 373 minutes), decreased intraoperative red blood cell transfusions (350 vs 1400 mL), and were more likely to be extubated in the operating room (50% vs 12%) compared with patients undergoing simultaneous repair. Over a median follow-up of 19.3 \u00b1 18.5 months, visceral graft patency was 97%; all occluded limbs were to renal vessels and clinically silent. There have been no type I or III endoleaks or reinterventions. Kaplan-Meier overall survival is 70.7% at 2 years and 57.9% at 5 years.\nHybrid TAAA repair through complete visceral debranching and endovascular aneurysm exclusion is a good option for elderly high-risk patients less suited to conventional repair in centers with the requisite surgical expertise with visceral revascularization. A staged approach to debranching and endovascular aneurysm exclusion during a single hospitalization appears to yield optimal results.",

    "abstract": "The role of gender on the outcome of infrainguinal arterial revascularization (IAR) for peripheral arterial occlusive disease remains uncertain. This study analyzed the outcome of IARs performed over 15 years, stratifying the results by sex.\nDetails of consecutive patients undergoing primary IAR for peripheral arterial occlusive disease from 1995 to 2009 at our institution were prospectively stored in a vascular registry. Demographics, risk factors, indications for surgery, inflow sources, outflow target vessels, types of conduit, and adverse outcomes were analyzed. Postoperative surveillance included clinical examination supplemented with duplex scans and ankle-brachial index measurements in all patients at discharge, 30 days, 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter. End points of the study, ie, patency, limb salvage, and survival rates, were assessed using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis. The \u03c7(2) or Fisher exact, Student t, and log-rank tests were used to establish statistical significance.\nOur sample consisted of 1459 IARs performed in 1333 patients, comprising 496 women (37.2%; 531 IARs), who were a mean 3 years older than the men (74 vs 71 years; P < .001) and had a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus (52% vs 46%; P = .03) and surgery for limb salvage (91% vs 87%; P = .02). An autogenous vein conduit (great or small saphenous, or both, spliced, arm, or composite veins) was used in 87% of the IARs. No deaths occurred perioperatively (30 days). The major and minor complication rates were comparable between men and women. At 10 years, the primary patency rate was 47% in women vs 49% in men (P = .67), the assisted primary patency rate was, respectively, 53% vs 50% (P = .69), the secondary patency rate was 61% vs 61% (P = .66), limb salvage rate was 93% vs 91% (P = .54), and survival rate was 43% vs 49% (P = .65). Stratifying by type of conduit revealed no differences in patency or limb salvage rates.\nDespite an older age and more advanced stages of disease on presentation in women, IAR performed in women can achieve patency and limb salvage rates statistically no different from those recorded in their male counterparts, supporting the conviction that sex per se does not influence the outcome of lower extremity revascularization.",

    "abstract": "When all access options in the upper limbs have been exhausted, an autogenous access in lower limb is a valuable alternative to arteriovenous grafts. We report our experience of transposition of the femoral vein (tFV).\nFrom June 1984 to June 2011, 70 patients underwent 72 tFV in two centers (Paris and Mekn\u00e8s) with the same technique. All patients had exhausted upper arm veins or had central vein obstructions. Patients were followed by serial duplex scanning. All complications were recorded and statistical analysis of patency was performed according to intention to treat using the life-table method.\nThe mean interval between initiation of dialysis and creation of the tFV was 10 years. The sex ratio was even (one female/one male). Mean age was 48 years (range, 1-84 years), and there were no postoperative infections. Duplex measurements in 33 patients indicated high-flow: mean = 1529 \u00b1 429 mL/min; range, 700-3000 mL/min. Two immediate failures were observed and four patients were lost to follow-up soon after the access creation. Ten patients (14%) experienced minor complications (hematoma, five; lymphocele, one; delayed wound healing, two; distal edema, two) and 30 patients (42%) experienced mild complications (femoral vein and outflow stenosis, 16 [treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, 13, or polytetrafluoroethylene patch, three]; puncture site complications, three [ischemia, two; infection, one]; reversible thrombosis, three [two surgical and one percutaneous thrombectomy]; abandoned thrombosis, eight [11%] after a mean patency of 8.1 years). Thirteen patients (18%) experienced major complications necessitating fistula ligation (ischemic complications, five diabetic patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease [one major amputation included]; lower leg compartment syndrome, one; acute venous hypertension, two; secondary major edema, two; high-output cardiac failure, one; bleeding, two). All the patent accesses (59/72) were utilized for dialysis after a mean interval of 2 \u00b1 1 months (range, 1-7 months) resulting in an 82% success rate.

The secondary patency rates at 1 and 9 years were 84% \u00b1 5% and 56% \u00b1 9%, respectively.\nFemoral vein transposition in the lower limb is a valuable alternative to arteriovenous grafts in terms of infection and long-term patency. Secondary venous percutaneous angioplasties may be necessary. High flow rates are frequently observed and patient selection is essential to avoid ischemic complications.",

    "abstract": "To retrospectively assess the therapeutic value of endovascular stenting for treatment of the nutcracker syndrome (NCS) in long-term follow-up and to explore the selection of the size of stents in Chinese patients with NCS.\nFrom January 2004 to August 2010, 30 patients (two women and 28 men) between 13 and 32 years old (mean, 18.2) who were diagnosed with NCS were admitted for endovascular treatment. Each patient received one self-expanding metallic stent (14-mm diameter, 60-mm long) in the compressed portion of the left renal vein during the operation, and three patients with severe left-sided varicoceles received left gonadal vein embolization. The postoperative follow-up was 12 to 80 months (median, 36.0 months).\nThe diameters at the ostium of left renal vein measured by the ultrasonic examination before treatment were 11.8 \u00b1 1.8 mm. Technical success of operation was achieved in all patients. No perioperative complications occurred. Two cases of stent migration were found at 12 months: both stents prolapsed into the inferior vena cava, with uneventful follow-up (49 and 56 months, respectively). At 1-month follow-up, patients improved, including two patients who had persistent but less microscopic hematuria than before treatment. The clinical symptoms related to NCS almost disappeared at 3 months after the treatment. All stents were patent at the duplex scan examination, without restenosis, and no secondary recurrence of the symptoms occurred at the end of the follow-up.\nEndovascular treatment is a safe, effective, and very minimally invasive technique that provides good long-term patency rates for patients with NCS, and under the premise morphologic measurements, 14-mm-diameter, 60-mm-long self-expanding stents should be first considered for Chinese patients with NCS.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) that also involve the common iliac artery (CIA) typically is accomplished by endograft limb extension into the external iliac artery (EIA). In order to prevent endoleak, the internal iliac artery (IIA) is usually embolized, or alternatively a branched limb is deployed. However, IIA embolization is associated with longer operative time and increased use of contrast and radiation. It has been our practice not to routinely coil embolize the IIA. The purpose of this study was to present the midterm outcomes of this approach.\nBetween April 1997 and June 2010, 137 patients (130 men; mean age, 70.9 years; range, 45-92 years) underwent EVAR of their AAA and had IIA coverage without coil embolization in 112 patients (no embolization [NE] group) and after coil embolization in 25 patients (coil embolization [CE] group). Anatomic indications for coverage of the IIA without coil embolization included presence of adequate sealing in the distal 5 mm of the CIA, or sealing ring at the origin of the CIA, or IIA diameter <5 mm. Preoperative mean AAA size was 60 \u00b1 14 mm, and mean CIA diameter was 38 \u00b1 13 mm. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) scanning was performed at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter.\nThirty-day mortality was 0.7% (1 of 137 patients). A patient presented with gluteal skin necrosis (0.7%). The incidence of postoperative buttock claudication was not different between the two groups (NE: 15 of 112 patients; CE: 3 of 25 patients; P = .852). Procedure and fluoroscopy time, contrast use, and hospital stay were significantly reduced in the NE group. Patients were followed up for 33 \u00b1 30 months. During follow-up, 44 patients died (32.1%) and in 3 of them (2.2%), death was AAA-related. There was no difference in cumulative survival between the two groups at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. Secondary interventions were performed in 20 of 137 patients (14.5%), including three conversions for proximal endoleak. There was no difference between the two groups in the incidence of secondary interventions (NE: 18 of 112 patients; CE: two of 25 patients; P = .301) and freedom from reintervention at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. Ten patients (8.9%) from the NE group presented a type II endoleak during follow-up. Seven of them were associated with the covered IIA; none required reintervention.\nStent graft coverage of the IIA without coil embolization is a safe, simple, and effective maneuver for the treatment of aortoiliac aneurysms, with a low incidence of postoperative complications and reinterventions and acceptable immediate and midterm results.",

This study is a single-center propensity score comparing early and midterm outcomes between open surgical repair (OSR) and endovascular repair of rAAA (REVAR).\nA retrospective review from January 2001 to November 2010 identified 312 patients who underwent rAAA repairs. Thirty-one patients with antecedent AAA repair and three with incomplete records were excluded, leaving 37 REVARs and 241 OSRs. Propensity score-based matching for sex, age, preoperative hemodynamic status, surgeon's annual AAA volume, and preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed in a 1:3 ratio to compare outcomes. Thirty-seven REVARs were matched with 111 OSRs. Late survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods.\nOperative time and blood replacement were higher with OSR. Overall complication rates were similar (54% REVAR vs 66% OSR; P = .23), except for higher incidences of tracheostomies (21% vs 3%; P = .015), myocardial infarction (38% vs 18%; P = .036), and acute tubular necrosis (47% vs 21%; P = .009) with OSR. Operative mortality rates were similar (22% REVAR vs 32% OSR), with an odds ratio of 0.63 for REVAR (95% confidence interval = [0.24, 1.48]; P = .40). No differences in the incidences for secondary interventions for aneurysm- or graft-related complications were noted (22% REVAR vs 22% OSR; P = .99). Kaplan-Meier estimates of 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were also similar (50%, 50%, 42% REVAR vs 54%, 52%, 47% OSR; P = .66).\nREVAR for rAAA does not seem to conclusively confer either acute or late survival advantages. Routine use of REVAR should be deferred until prospective, randomized trial data become available.",

    "abstract": "A discrepancy between characteristics of patients treated with carotid angioplasty and stent placement (CAS) within and outside clinical trials, particularly characteristics with direct impact on clinical outcome, may limit generalization of clinical trial results. The objective of this study was to identify differences in demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes related to CAS in patients treated within clinical trials and those treated outside clinical trials in a large national cohort.\nWe determined the frequency of CAS performed within and outside clinical trials and associated in-hospital outcomes using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Survey data files from 2005 to 2009. All the in-hospital outcomes were analyzed after adjusting for potential confounders using multivariate analysis.\nOf the 81,638 patients who underwent CAS, 16,078 (19.6%) underwent the procedure as part of a clinical trial. The mean age of the patients was significantly lower in patients treated with CAS as part of a clinical trial than those treated with CAS outside a clinical trial. The proportion of women and nonwhites was lower among patients treated with CAS as part of a clinical trial. The in-hospital mortality was two-fold higher among patients treated with CAS outside clinical trials (1.12% vs 0.53%; P = .0005). The rate of composite endpoint of stroke, cardiac events, and death was significantly higher among patients treated with CAS outside clinical trials (P = .02). After adjusting for age, gender, presence of renal failure, and hospital bed size, CAS performed as part of a clinical trial was associated with lower rates of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.467; 95% confidence interval, 0.290-0.751; P = .0017) and composite endpoint of stroke, cardiac events, and death (odds ratio, 0.752; 95% confidence interval, 0.594-0.952; P = .0180).\nOur results suggest that CAS procedures performed as part of clinical trials was associated with lower rates of in-hospital mortality and composite endpoint of stroke, cardiac events, and death in United States. These findings highlight the need for strategies that ensure appropriate adoption of CAS to ensure that the benefits observed in clinical trials can be replicated in general practice.",

Long-segment thoracoabdominal aortic occlusion, an extreme manifestation of this disorder, has not previously been reported in children. Two pediatric patients with this entity, a 5- and 13-year-old with uncontrolled hypertension, underwent extensive arterial reconstructions for this entity and provided the impetus for this report. An ascending thoracic aorta to infrarenal aortic expanded polytetrafluoroethylene bypass was undertaken in the younger child. A distal thoracic aorto-bi-iliac artery expanded polytetrafluoroethylene bypass, with implantation of the left renal artery to one graft limb and a right renal artery bypass originating from the other limb, was performed in the older child. There were no major perioperative complications. Both patients were discharged with easily controlled blood pressures. They have remained normotensive at 13 and 14 months follow-up.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this report was to present abnormal posttraumatic cold intolerance in patients that previously underwent repair of arterial injuries after civilian upper limb trauma in our institution.\nAll patients who underwent repair of arterial lesions after upper limb trauma since 1990 were reviewed, and clinical follow-up studies were performed. Patients were asked to complete the cold intolerance symptom severity (CISS) questionnaire to evaluate presence and severity of self-reported cold sensitivity, and the disabilities of arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) questionnaire to analyze functional disability. Abnormal cold intolerance was defined as a CISS score over 30. Further analysis included evaluation of epidemiologic, clinical, and perioperative data for factors predisposing to abnormal cold intolerance.\nA total of 87 patients with previous repair of upper limb arterial injuries were eligible to answer the CISS and DASH questionnaires, and 56 patients (64%; 43 men; median age: 31.9 years) completed both. In our cohort, blunt trauma was the predominant cause of injury (n = 50; 89%). Accompanying lesions of nerves (n = 22; 39%) and/or orthopedic injuries (n = 36; 64%) were present in 48 patients (86%). After a median follow-up period of 5.5 years (range, 0.5-19.7), 23 patients (41% of 56) reported on abnormal cold intolerance. Patients with cold intolerance had worse functional results (as measured by the DASH questionnaire; mean \u00b1 SD, 42.7 \u00b1 29.7 vs 11.5 \u00b1 23.9; P < .001) when compared with patients without. Cold intolerance was more frequently seen in patients with previous nerve lesion (P = .027) and in proximal injuries (subclavian or axillary vs brachial or forearm arteries: P = .006), but was not correlated to gender, age, involvement of the dominant or nondominant arm, and the presence of ischemia, bone injury, or an isolated vascular injury.\nAbnormal cold intolerance is frequently seen in patients with a history of arterial repair in upper limb trauma. It is associated with significant functional impairment. Concomitant nerve injury and involvement of the subclavian or axillary artery are the major predisposing factors for development of cold intolerance after upper limb trauma.",

    "abstract": "The calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) model is a widely accepted rodent model for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Calcium deposition, mainly consisting of calcium phosphate (CaPO(4)) crystals, has been reported to exist in human and experimental aneurysms. CaPO(4) crystals have been used for in vitro DNA transfection by mixing CaCl(2) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Here, we describe accelerated aneurysm formation resulting from a modification of the CaCl(2) model.\nA modified CaCl(2) model, the CaPO(4) model, was created by applying PBS onto the mouse infrarenal aorta after CaCl(2) treatment. Morphologic, histologic, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on arteries treated with the CaPO(4) model and the conventional CaCl(2) model as the control. In vitro methods were performed using a mixture of CaCl(2) and PBS to create CaPO(4) crystals. CaPO(4)- induced apoptosis of primary cultured mouse vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) was measured by DNA fragmentation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nThe CaPO(4) model produces AAA, defined as an increase of \u226550% in the diameter of the aorta, faster than in the CaCl(2) model. The CaPO(4) model showed significantly larger aneurysmal dilation at 7, 28, and 42 days, as reflected by a maximum diameter (measured in mm) fold-change of 1.69 \u00b1 0.07, 1.99 \u00b1 0.14, and 2.13 \u00b1 0.09 vs 1.22 \u00b1 0.04, 1.48 \u00b1 0.07, and 1.68 \u00b1 0.06 in a CaCl(2) model, respectively (n = 6; P < .05). A semiquantitative grading analysis of elastin fiber integrity at 7 days revealed a significant increase in elastin degradation in the CaPO(4) model compared with the CaCl(2) model (2.7 \u00b1 0.2 vs 1.5 \u00b1 0.2; n = 6; P < .05). A significantly higher level of apoptosis occurred in the CaPO(4) model (apoptosis index at 1, 2, and 3 days postsurgery: 0.26 \u00b1 0.14, 0.37 \u00b1 0.14, and 0.33 \u00b1 0.08 vs 0.012 \u00b1 0.10, 0.15 \u00b1 0.02, and 0.12 \u00b1 0.05 in the conventional CaCl(2) model; n = 3; P < .05). An enhancement of macrophage infiltration and calcification was also observed at 3 and 7 days in the CaPO(4) model. CaPO(4) induced approximately 3.7 times more apoptosis in VSMCs than a mixture of CaCl(2) (n = 4; P < .0001) in vitro.\nThe CaPO(4) model accelerates aneurysm formation with the enhancement of apoptosis, macrophage infiltration, and calcium deposition. This modified model, with its rapid and robust dilation, can be used as a new model for AAAs.",

The CaPO(4) model showed significantly larger aneurysmal dilation at 7, 28, and 42 days, as reflected by a maximum diameter (measured in mm) fold-change of 1.69 \u00b1 0.07, 1.99 \u00b1 0.14, and 2.13 \u00b1 0.09 vs 1.22 \u00b1 0.04, 1.48 \u00b1 0.07, and 1.68 \u00b1 0.06 in a CaCl(2) model, respectively (n = 6; P < .05). A semiquantitative grading analysis of elastin fiber integrity at 7 days revealed a significant increase in elastin degradation in the CaPO(4) model compared with the CaCl(2) model (2.7 \u00b1 0.2 vs 1.5 \u00b1 0.2; n = 6; P < .05). A significantly higher level of apoptosis occurred in the CaPO(4) model (apoptosis index at 1, 2, and 3 days postsurgery: 0.26 \u00b1 0.14, 0.37 \u00b1 0.14, and 0.33 \u00b1 0.08 vs 0.012 \u00b1 0.10, 0.15 \u00b1 0.02, and 0.12 \u00b1 0.05 in the conventional CaCl(2) model; n = 3; P < .05). An enhancement of macrophage infiltration and calcification was also observed at 3 and 7 days in the CaPO(4) model.

    "abstract": "Development in endograft design has extended endovascular treatment to include thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA). We report our experience using fenestrated and branched endografts in the management of TAAA.\nWe analyzed a cohort of consecutive patients treated electively for TAAA using endovascular techniques between 2006 and 2011. All data were collected prospectively. The relationships between preoperative risk factors and clinical outcome were examined using univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. We also compared the outcomes between 33 previously published early cases (EC) with the last 56 later cases (LC).\nEighty-nine patients (83 men) were treated. Median age was 69 years. All patients were deemed unfit for open surgery. The 30-day and in-hospital mortality rates were 8.9% and 10%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed in-hospital mortality was associated with preoperative chronic renal failure and advanced age. Higher postoperative mean arterial blood pressure was a protective factor. Technical success rate was 96.6% (94% and 98% in the EC and LC groups, respectively; P = .14). The spinal cord ischemia (SCI) rate was 7.8% (15% and 3% in the EC and LC groups, respectively; P = .063) and was associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and procedure duration. Six patients (6.7%) required temporary filtration, but none required permanent renal support (associated with left ventricular ejection fraction <40% and procedure duration). Median procedure duration decreased from 232 to 203 minutes (P = .01) in the EC and LC groups, respectively. Actuarial survival was 86.8% \u00b1 3.7% at 1 year and 74.7% \u00b1 6% at 2 years.\nAlthough we have treated a cohort at high operative risk, our midterm results compare favorably with the published series of conventional surgery. Accurate hemodynamic control represented by high-normal perioperative blood pressure seems to protect against severe postoperative complications.",

    "abstract": "Although carotid artery stenosis and coronary artery disease often coexist, many debate which patients are best served by combined concurrent revascularization (carotid endarterectomy [CEA]/coronary artery bypass graft [CABG]). We studied the use of CEA/CABG in New England and compared indications and outcomes, including stratification by risk, symptoms, and performing center.\nUsing data from the Vascular Study Group of New England from 2003 to 2009, we studied all patients who underwent combined CEA/CABG across six centers in New England. Our main outcome measure was in-hospital stroke or death. We compared outcomes between all patients undergoing combined CEA/CABG to a baseline CEA risk group comprised of patients undergoing isolated CEA at non-CEA/CABG centers. Further, we compared in-hospital stroke and death rates between high and low neurologic risk patients, defining high neurologic risk patients as those who had at least one of the following clinical or anatomic features: (1) symptomatic carotid disease, (2) bilateral carotid stenosis >70%, (3) ipsilateral stenosis >70% and contralateral occlusion, or (4) ipsilateral or bilateral occlusion.\nOverall, compared to patients undergoing isolated CEA at non-CEA/CABG centers (n = 1563), patients undergoing CEA/CABG (n = 109) were more likely to have diabetes (44% vs 29%; P = .001), creatinine >1.8 mg/dL (11% vs 5%; P = .007), and congestive heart failure (23% vs 10%; P < .001). Patients undergoing CEA/CABG were also more likely to take preoperative beta-blockers (94% vs 75%; P < .001) and less likely to take preoperative clopidogrel (7% vs 25%; P < .001). Patients undergoing CEA/CABG had higher rates of contralateral carotid occlusion (13% vs 5%; P = .001) and were more likely to undergo an urgent/emergent procedure (30% vs 15%; P < .001). The risk of complications was higher in CEA/CABG compared to isolated CEA, including increased risk of stroke (5.5% vs 1.2%; P < .001), death (5.5% vs 0.3%; P < .001), and return to the operating room for any reason (7.6% vs 1.2%; P < .001). Of 109 patients undergoing CEA/CABG, 61 (56%) were low neurologic risk and 48 (44%) were high neurologic risk but showed no demonstrable difference in stroke (4.9% vs 6.3%; P = .76), death, (4.9 vs 6.3%; P = .76), or return to the operating room (10.2% vs 4.3%; P = .25).\nAlthough practice patterns in the use of CEA/CABG vary across our region, the risk of complications with CEA/CABG remains significantly higher than in isolated CEA. Future work to improve patient selection in CEA/CABG is needed to improve perioperative results with combined coronary and carotid revascularization.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of endovascular interventions has been reported to lower amputation rates, but patients who undergo endovascular and open revascularization are not directly comparable. We have adopted an endovascular-first approach but individualize the revascularization technique according to patient characteristics. This study compared characteristics of patients who had endovascular and open procedures and assessed the long-term outcomes.\nFrom December 2002 to September 2010, 433 patients underwent infrainguinal revascularization for critical limb ischemia (CLI; Rutherford IV-VI) of 514 limbs (endovascular: 295 patients, 363 limbs; open: 138 patients, 151 limbs). Patency rates, limb salvage (LS), and survival, as also their predictors, were calculated using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analysis.\nThe endovascular group was older, with more diabetes, renal insufficiency, and tissue loss. More reconstructions were multilevel (72% vs 39%; P < .001) and the most distal level of intervention was infrapopliteal in the open group (64% vs 49%; P = .001). The 30-day mortality was 2.8% in the endovascular and 6.0% in the open group (P = .079). Mean follow-up was 28.4 \u00b1 23.1 months (0-100). In the endovascular vs open groups, 7% needed open, and 24% needed inflow/runoff endovascular reinterventions with or without thrombolysis vs 6% and 17%. In the endovascular vs open group, 5-year LS was 78% \u00b1 3% vs 78% \u00b1 4% (P = .992), amputation-free survival was 30% \u00b1 3% vs 39% \u00b1 5% (P = .227), and survival was 36% \u00b1 4% vs 46% \u00b1 5% (P = .146). Five-year primary patency (PP), assisted-primary patency (APP), and secondary patency (SP) rates were 50 \u00b1 5%, 70 \u00b1 5% and 73 \u00b1 6% in endovascular, and 48 \u00b1 6%, 59 \u00b1 6% and 64 \u00b1 6% in the open group, respectively (P = .800 for PP, 0.037 for APP, 0.022 for SP). Multivariate analysis identified poor functional capacity (hazard ratio, 3.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.9-6.5]; P < .001), dialysis dependence (2.2 [1.3-3.8]; P = .003), gangrene (2.2 [1.4-3.4]; P < .001), need for infrapopliteal intervention (2.0 [1.2-3.1]; P = .004), and diabetes (1.8 [1.1-3.1]; P = .031) as predictors of limb loss. Poor functional capacity (3.3 [2.4-4.6]; P < .001), coronary artery disease (1.5 [1.1-2.1]; P = .006), and gangrene (1.4 [1.1-1.9]; P = .007) predicted poorer survival. Statin use predicted improved survival (0.6 [0.5-0.8]; P = .001). Need for infrapopliteal interventions predicted poorer PP (0.6 [0.5-0.9-2.2]; P = .007), whereas use of autologous vein predicted better PP (1.8 [1.1-2.9]; P = .017).\nPatients who undergo endovascular revascularization for CLI are medically higher-risk patients. Those who have bypass have more complex disease and are more likely to require multilevel reconstruction and infrapopliteal intervention. Individualizing revascularization results in optimization of early and late outcomes with acceptable LS, although survival remains low in those with poor health status.",

It has been suggested that an ankle-brachial index (ABI) >1.30 or an ankle-brachial difference (ABD) >75 mm Hg may identify X-ray MAC, but test characteristics are unknown. We hypothesized that an ABI >1.30 and ABD >75 mm Hg would have high specificity but low sensitivity for MAC on X-ray imaging.\nThis was a cross-sectional study of 185 community-living individuals with type 1 diabetes. The ABI and the ABD were assessed. The outcome was linear \"tram-track\" calcifications in the lower limbs characteristic of MAC.\nMean age was 32 \u00b1 6 years, and mean diabetes duration was 23 \u00b1 7 years. X-ray MAC was noted in 97 individuals (57%), 15 (8%) had ABI >1.30, and 14 (8%) had ABD >75 mm Hg. As assessed by the ABI, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for MAC was modest (0.65) and was slightly higher for the ABD (0.75). An ABI >1.30 had high specificity (99%) and positive predictive value (93%) but poor sensitivity (14%) and an overall accuracy of 55% for MAC. An ABD >50 mm Hg remained highly specific (98%) but had higher sensitivity (30%) and overall accuracy (62%).\nIndividuals with type 1 diabetes and an ABI >1.30 or ABD >50 mm Hg are very likely to have MAC on X-ray imaging, yet many with MAC will not have an ABI or ABD above these thresholds. Given the high specificity, evaluating high ABI or ABD may be useful to understand correlates of MAC but may underestimate MAC prevalence.",

    "abstract": "Amniotic membrane, as a natural biomaterial, has many advantages, such as low immunogenicity, anti-inflammation, antifibrosis, and rich extracellular matrix components, which make it a promising source for vascular tissue engineering. This study assessed the feasibility of constructing a vein conduit from the amniotic membrane and implanting it in the external jugular vein of juvenile sheep.\nHuman amniotic membrane was prepared using fresh human placenta. For construction of a tube such as a vein, the membrane was rolled around a tube and amniotic membrane-constructed conduits were interposed to the external jugular vein by end-to-end anastomosis. Grafts were assessed for patency at weeks 5 and 48 and explanted for evaluation with histologic and microscopic techniques.\nAt 5 weeks after implantation, the grafts were completely patent and displayed no signs of dilation. The internal surface was smooth and shiny, without any evidence of thrombus formation. After 48 weeks, grafts were still completely patent and displayed no signs of intimal thickening, dilation, or stenosis. No inflammation or fibrosis was evident. Histologic evaluation of the explanted grafts demonstrated a monolayer of endothelial cells. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a confluent layer of cells with normal endothelial cell morphology. A monolayer of cells positive for von Willebrand factor was detected in histology sections.\nThe findings of this study confirm that the amniotic membrane can be a proper substitute for vascular tissue engineering.",

We report the first known case of symptomatic, extrinsic compression of the carotid artery by fibrotic extension of sclerosing mediastinitis. A 54-year-old woman began experiencing neurologic symptoms from extension of a known mediastinal mass resulting in 70% to 79% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. The stenosis was treated with endovascular stenting. Completion angiogram revealed a good result with <10% residual stenosis.

    "abstract": "Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) is a critically time-sensitive condition with outcomes dependent on rapid diagnosis and definitive treatment. Emergency department (ED) death reflects the hemodynamic stability of the patient upon arrival and the ability to mobilize resources before hemodynamic stability is lost. The goals of this study were to determine the incidence and predictors of ED death for patients presenting to EDs with rAAAs.\nData for patients presenting with International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes for rAAA from 2006 to 2008 were extracted from discharge data using the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The NEDS is the largest stratified weighted sample of US hospital-based ED visits with links to inpatient files. We compared those transferred to those admitted and treated. Sample weights were applied to produce nationally representative estimates. Patient and hospital factors associated with transfer were identified using multivariate logistic regression. These factors were then analyzed for a relationship with ED deaths.\nA total of 18,363 patients were evaluated for rAAAs. Of these, 7% (1201) died in the ED, 6% (1160) were admitted and died without a procedure, 42% (7731) were admitted and died after repair, and 41% (7479) were admitted, treated, and survived. Transfers accounted for 4% (793) of all ED visits for rAAAs. ED death was more likely for patients seen in nonmetropolitan hospitals (12.7%) vs metropolitan nonteaching (7.0%) or metropolitan teaching hospitals (4.5%; P < .0001). Compared with other regions, the West had a higher ED mortality rate (9.6% vs 5.1%-6.9%; P = .0038). On multivariate analysis, ED death was associated with hospital groups exhibiting both high and low transfer rates.\nED death remains a significant cause for mortality for rAAAs and varies by hospital type, rural/urban location, and geographic region. Both delays in ED arrival and delays in providing definitive care may contribute to increased ED death rates, suggesting that improved regional systems of care may improve survival after rAAA.",

    "abstract": "This study determined early and intermediate results of multibranched endovascular thoracoabdominal (TAAA) and pararenal aortic aneurysm (PRAA) repair using a uniform operative technique.\nEighty-one patients (mean age, 73 \u00b1 8 years, 19 [23.5%] women) underwent endovascular TAAA repair in a prospective trial using self-expanding covered stents connecting axially oriented, caudally directed cuffs to target aortic branches. Mean aneurysm diameter was 67 \u00b1 10 mm. Thirty-nine TAAA (48.1%) were Crawford type II, III, or V; 42 (51.9%) were type IV or pararenal. Thirty-three procedures (40.7%) were staged. The insertion approach was femoral for aortic components and brachial for branch components. Follow-up assessments were performed at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter.\nAll devices (n = 81) and branches (n = 306) were successfully inserted and deployed, with no conversions to open repair. Overall mortality was 6.2% (n = 5), including three perioperative (3.7%) and two late treatment-related deaths (2.5%). Permanent paraplegia occurred in three patients (3.7%), and transient paraplegia/paraparesis occurred in 16 (19.8%). Four patients (4.9%) required dialysis postoperatively, three permanently and one transiently. Women accounted for 67% of the paraplegia, 75% of the perioperative dialysis, and 60% of the perioperative or treatment-related deaths. During a mean follow-up of 21.2 months, no aneurysms ruptured, but four (4.9%) enlarged: two were successfully treated, one was unsuccessfully treated, and one was not treated. No late onset spinal cord ischemia symptoms developed. Of the five patients starting dialysis during follow-up, two resulted from renal branch occlusion. Sixteen branches occluded (nine renal, two celiac) or developed stenoses (four renal, one superior mesenteric artery), requiring stenting. Primary patency was 94.8%, and primary-assisted patency was 95.1%. Thirty-two patients (39.5%) underwent 42 reinterventions. Of 25 early reinterventions (\u2264 45 days), 10 were to treat access or insertion complications, and 5 were for endoleak. Of 17 late reinterventions, eight were for endoleak and five were for branch stenosis/occlusion. New endoleaks developed in two patients during follow-up. Overall, 73 of 81 patients (90.1%) were treated without procedure-related death, dialysis, paralysis, aneurysm rupture, or conversion to open repair.\nTotal endovascular TAAA/PRAA repair using caudally directed cuffs is safe, effective, and durable in the intermediate term. The most common form of late failure, renal artery occlusion, rarely had a clinically significant consequence (dialysis). The trend toward worse outcome in women needs further study.",

    "abstract": "Strict glucose control in patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting has been shown to decrease infectious complications, arrhythmias, and mortality. Our objective was to determine if strict glucose control reduced morbidity after lower extremity bypass (LEB).\nA prospective pilot study at a single institution within the Vascular Study Group of New England was conducted from January 2009 to December 2010. Patients with diabetes and without undergoing LEB were placed on an intravenous (IV) insulin infusion for 3 days after surgery with titration of blood glucose from 80 to 150 mg/dL. The IV insulin study group (n = 104) was compared to a historic control group (n = 189) that received standard insulin treatment from the preceding 3 years. The Fisher exact test, t-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, \u03c7(2), and logistic regression analyses were used to compare in-hospital morbidity. Stratified analyses were conducted to determine if findings differed based on the presence or absence of diabetes.\nThere was no difference in postoperative complications between the two groups with regard to graft infection, myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, primary patency at discharge, or mortality. Patients in the IV insulin group had significantly fewer in-hospital wound infections (4% vs 11%; odds ratio [OR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.96; P = .047). This association strengthened after adjusting for potentially confounding baseline differences in gender, body mass index, and smoking status (adjusted OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05-0.84; P = .03). When stratified by presence of diabetes, wound infections were decreased in the IV insulin group (0/44 [0%] vs 9/90 [10%]; P = .03). In patients without diabetes treated with IV insulin, there was no significant difference in wound infections (7% vs 12%; P = .42).\nStrict glucose control with a postoperative insulin infusion protocol significantly decreased the incidence of postoperative in-hospital wound infection in the diabetic population. These previously unreported findings from this single-institution prospective study warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Contrary to coronary artery literature, the effect of preprocedural clopidogrel on renal artery restenosis (RAR) has not been characterized. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of preprocedural clopidogrel on target vessel revascularization (TVR), reintervention, and restenosis for patients who underwent recurrent renal artery angioplasty.\nA retrospective analysis of patients treated for RAR in a single tertiary center from January 1999 to December 2009 was conducted. Patients were divided into preadmission use of (1) clopidogrel or (2) aspirin only (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) for the initial procedure. TVR was defined as occurrence of a tertiary procedure for symptomatic RAR. Rate of freedom from event (ie, tertiary restenosis and TVR) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method.\nEighty-eight interventions were performed on 77 patients with RAR; 66% were females with average (mean \u00b1 SEM) age and body mass index of 68.8 \u00b1 1.1 and 28.6 \u00b1 0.8, respectively. Comorbidities included 96% chronic hypertension, 33% diabetes, 76% hyperlipidemia, 20% renal insufficiency, 39% tobacco use, 58% coronary artery disease, and 51% peripheral vascular disease. Clopidogrel use increased significantly during the index procedure from admission 35.2% to discharge 97.7% (P < .001, McNemar test). There was a trend toward risk reduction of a tertiary intervention (23%) for patients admitted on clopidogrel compared with ASA (P = .052). Likewise, there was a trend (P = .051) toward increased freedom from a tertiary intervention, with cumulative freedom at 8 years 93.5% for clopidogrel vs 61% for ASA. No differences were found for restenosis.\nThe use of preprocedural clopidogrel was associated with a possible risk reduction of TVR reintervention, but this finding needs to be validated in randomized clinical trial.",

In particular, 59 patients were treated by endovascular means such as fenestrated endovascular abdominal aortic repair (f-EVAR, n = 29) or chimney endovascular abdominal aortic repair (ch-EVAR, n = 30) endografting, and 31 patients underwent open repair (OR, n = 31).\nEarly procedure-related and all-cause (30-day) procedure-related mortality was 0% for the endovascular group and 6.4% (n = 2/31) for the OR group, due to systemic inflammatory response syndrome with consecutive multi-organ failure (P = .023). Persistent postoperative hemodialysis occurred only after OR (2/31; 6.4%). The overall estimated pre- and postoperative median estimated glomerular filtration rate and creatinine values were similar in the three subgroups. There was one left renal artery occlusion for each endovascular subgroup, which presented as flank pain and was treated by iliaco-renal bypass in both cases. Transfusion requirements and length of hospital stay were significantly less in the endovascular group (P = .014 and P = .004, respectively).\nEndovascular treatment of JAAA is a safe alternative for the short-term management of JAAA.",

Secondary end points comprised bleeding complications, amputation, and death.\nThe study evaluated 15 patients with 17 Szilagyi III groin infections. Mean total length of VAC therapy was 43 days (range, 14-76 days). Mean time until complete healing was 51 days (range, 24-82 days). Mean length of VAC therapy in the hospital was 21 days (range, 5-61 days). Eleven patients received continued VAC treatment at home for a mean length of 22 days (range, 5-69 days). Complete healing was achieved in 14 groins (82%). Three failures due to persisting infection, persisting necrosis, and a pseudomonas infection were noted. No bleeding complications, amputations, or late reinfections occurred. Median follow-up was 380 days (range, 56-939 days). Despite therapy failure, all 17 grafts were preserved.\nVAC therapy on an exposed prosthetic vascular graft in the groin is safe and feasible when applying a combination of polyvinyl alcohol and polyurethane foam dressing and 50 mm Hg of continuous negative pressure, resulting in midterm graft preservation.",

    "abstract": "Patients with advanced peripheral artery disease (PAD) have a high prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and shortened life expectancy. However, CV risk factors poorly predict midterm (<5 years) mortality in this population. This study tested the hypothesis that baseline biochemical parameters would add clinically meaningful predictive information in patients undergoing lower extremity bypass operations.\nThis was a prospective cohort study of patients with clinically advanced PAD undergoing lower extremity bypass surgery. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the main outcome of all-cause mortality. A clinical model was constructed with known CV risk factors, and the incremental value of the addition of clinical chemistry, lipid assessment, and a panel of 11 inflammatory parameters was investigated using the C statistic, the integrated discrimination improvement index, and Akaike information criterion.\nThe study monitored 225 patients for a median of 893 days (interquartile range, 539-1315 days). In this study, 50 patients (22.22%) died during the follow-up period.

    "abstract": "Wound morbidity commonly accompanies transposition of the femoral vein when used for hemodialysis access, mainly because of the length of the skin incision. A short incision may reduce wound complications but may compromise the arteriovenous (AV) function because of the shorter length of femoral vein available for puncture. This report presents our experience with a modification of the original technique, in which a smaller skin incision and fistula elevation were used.\nThe clinical course of 25 AV fistulas in the thigh using the femoral vein was retrospectively analyzed. The original technique to create femoral AV access was used in 12 patients and the modified technique in 13. The procedures were performed between 2005 and 2007, and patients were monitored until January 31, 2011.\nThree fistulas failed in each group. Five patients in the original group had wound complications. No wound complications occurred in the modified group. The fistula was first used at an average of 10.45 weeks and 6.14 weeks, respectively. Patency was similar in both groups.\nIt is possible to obtain a functional AV fistula in the thigh using the femoral vessels and limiting the extent of the incision. Long-term patency is reasonable, despite the use of a short femoral segment for puncture.",

    "abstract": "The National Kidney Foundation recommends that arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) be placed in at least 65% of hemodialysis patients. Some studies suggest that African American patients are less likely to receive a first-time AVF than patients of other ethnicities, although the reason for this disparity is unclear. The purpose of our study is to determine (1) whether there are ethnic differences in AVF creation, (2) whether this may be related to differences in vein diameters, and (3) whether AVF patency rates are similar between African American and non-African American male patients.\nConsecutive male patients undergoing first-time hemodialysis access from 2006 to 2010 at two institutions were retrospectively reviewed. Data collected included age, ethnicity, weight, height, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, smoking history, intravenous drug abuse, need for temporary access placement, and preoperative venous ultrasound measurements. Categoric variables were compared using \u03c7(2) analysis, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare continuous variables.\nOf 249 male patients identified, 95 were African American. Median age in African American and non-African American patients was 63 years. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia were statistically significantly greater in African American patients. The need for temporary access before hemoaccess was similar between the cohorts. African American patients demonstrated significantly smaller median basilic and cephalic vein diameters at most measured sites. Overall, 221 of 249 (88.8%) underwent AVF first. An AV graft was created in 17.9% of African American patients vs in only 7.1% of non-African Americans (odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.4; P = .009). The difference between median vein diameters used for autologous fistula creation in African American and non-African American patients was not significant. There was no significant difference in the primary patency (80.8% vs 76.2%; P = .4), primary functional patency (73.1% vs 69.2%; P = .5), or secondary functional patency rates (91.0% vs 96.5%; P = .1). Average primary fistula survival time was 257 days in African American and 256 in non-African American patients (P = .2).\nAfrican American patients are less likely than non-African American patients to undergo AVF during first-time hemodialysis access surgery. This ethnic discrepancy appears to be due to smaller arm vein diameters in African American patients. In African American patients with appropriate vein diameters who do undergo AVF, primary and functional patencies are equivalent to non-African American patients.",

    "abstract": "The two techniques for carotid endarterectomy (CEA)--conventional (C-CEA) and eversion (E-CEA)--have different effects on blood pressure. This study compared sympathetic activity after C-CEA and E-CEA, as measured by renin and catecholamine levels.\nE-CEA (n = 40) and C-CEA (n = 34) were performed in 74 patients with high-grade carotid stenosis. The choice of technique was made at the discretion of the operating surgeon. All patients received clonidine (150 \u03bcg) preoperatively. Regional anesthesia was used. The carotid sinus nerve was transected during E-CEA and preserved during C-CEA. Renin, metanephrine, and normetanephrine levels were measured preoperatively and at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively.\nCompared with baseline, levels of renin, metanephrine, and normetanephrine decreased at 24 and 48 hours after C-CEA (P < .0001). After E-CEA, however, renin and normetanephrine levels were unchanged at 24 hours, and metanephrine levels were increased (P < .0001). At 48 hours, levels of renin (P = .04), metanephrine (P < .0001), and normetanephrine (P = .02) were increased. Compared with C-CEA, E-CEA was associated with significantly increased sympathetic activity at 24 and 48 hours (P < .0001). Although the use of vasodilators for postoperative hypertension did not differ in the postanesthesia care unit (E-CEA 35% vs C-CEA 18%, P = .12), vasodilator use on the ward was more frequent after E-CEA (60% vs 32%, P = .02).\nE-CEA appears to be associated with greater postoperative sympathetic activity and vasodilator requirements than C-CEA, findings likely related to sacrifice of the carotid sinus nerve during E-CEA but not C-CEA.",

    "abstract": "Patients having undergone femoropopliteal bypass surgery remain at significant risk of graft failure. Although antithrombotic therapy is of paramount importance in these patients, the effect of oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) on outcomes remains unresolved. We performed a randomized, prospective study to assess the impact of OAT plus clopidogrel vs dual antiplatelet therapy on peripheral vascular and systemic cardiovascular outcomes in patients who had undergone femoropopliteal bypass surgery.\nThree hundred forty-one patients who had undergone femoropopliteal surgery were enrolled and randomized: 173 patients received clopidogrel 75 mg/d plus OAT with warfarin (C + OAT), and 168 patients received dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel 75 mg/d plus aspirin 100 mg/d (C + acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]). Study end points were graft patency and the occurrence of severe peripheral arterial ischemia, and the incidence of bleeding episodes.\nFollow-up ranged from 4 to 9 years. The graft patency rate and the freedom from severe peripheral arterial ischemia was significantly higher in C + OAT group than in C + ASA group (P = .026 and .044, respectively, Cox-Mantel test). The linearized incidence of minor bleeding complications was significantly higher in C + OAT group than in C + ASA group (2.85% patient-years vs 1.37% patient-years; P = .03). The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events, including mortality, was found to be similar (P = .34) for both study groups.\nIn patients who have undergone femoropopliteal vascular surgery, combination therapy with clopidogrel plus warfarin is more effective than dual antiplatelet therapy in increasing graft patency and in reducing severe peripheral ischemia. These improvements are obtained at the expenses of an increase in the rate of minor anticoagulation-related complications.",

There are no data about the prognostic significance of rates of variation of the CRP levels in asymptomatic AAAs. This study investigated the association between plasma CRP levels and AAA diameter and assessed the relationship between the gradient of CRP levels and rates of expansion in asymptomatic AAAs.\nPlasma levels of high-sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) were measured using a high-sensitivity technique and AAA size was determined by computed tomography in 435 patients with asymptomatic AAAs followed up in our outpatient department.\nThe median hs-CRP level was 4.23 mg/L. The aorta diameter increased in the four groups of patients determined according to hs-CRP quartiles (35 \u00b1 2, 40 \u00b1 3, 49 \u00b1 4, and 58 \u00b1 5 mm; P = .01). The median rate of CRP level variation per year was 1.4 mg/L. Patients with an elevation >1.4 mg/L had an expansion rate of 4.8 mm vs 3.9 mm in those <1.4 mg/L (P < .01). The multivariate age-adjusted logistic model confirmed initial diameter and variation of CRP level were the only factors associated with expansion, with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 6.3 (3.1-7.5) and 3.4 (2.1-5.6).\nThese results confirm a statistical association between AAA diameter and hs-CRP plasma levels. This cohort study corroborates this potential causal association and contributes information about the value of the hs-CRP plasma level gradient as a marker of disease progression and rate of expansion.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms of restenosis in autogenous vein bypass grafts placed for peripheral artery disease are not completely understood. We investigated the role of hemodynamic stress in a case study of a revised bypass graft that failed due to restenosis.\nThe morphology of the lumen was reconstructed from a custom three-dimensional ultrasound system. Scans were taken at 1, 6, and 16 months after a patch angioplasty procedure. Computational hemodynamic simulations of the patient-specific model provided the blood flow features and the hemodynamic stresses on the vessel wall at the three times studied.\nThe vessel was initially free of any detectable lesions, but a 60% diameter-reducing stenosis developed during the 16-month study interval. As determined from the simulations, chaotic and recirculating flow occurred downstream of the stenosis due to the sudden widening of the lumen at the patch location. Curvature and a sudden increase in the lumen cross-sectional area induced these flow features that are hypothesized to be conducive to intimal hyperplasia. Favorable agreement was found between simulation results and in vivo Doppler ultrasound velocity measurements.\nTransitional and chaotic flow occurs at the site of the revision, inducing a complex pattern of wall shear as computed with the hemodynamic simulations. This supports the hypothesis that the hemodynamic stresses in the revised segment, produced by the coupling of vessel geometry and chaotic flow, led to the intimal hyperplasia and restenosis of the graft.",

As the recommendations of these five guideline committees were based on the same published literature, it would be expected that they are similar, at least to a large extent.

    "abstract": "Although obesity is a risk factor for vascular disease, previous studies have shown an obesity paradox with decreased mortality in obese patients undergoing vascular surgery. This study examined the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and outcomes after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).\nThe 2005-2009 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried to evaluate 30-day outcomes after isolated CEA across National Institutes of Health-defined obesity classes. \u03c7(2) analysis was used to assess the unadjusted relationship of BMI category to postoperative outcomes. The independent association of BMI with morbidity and mortality was assessed with multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for preoperative and operative characteristics.\nIn the cohort of 23,652 CEA, 1.8% of patients were underweight (BMI <18.5), 26.6% were normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9), 39.4% were overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9), 21.1% were class I obese (BMI 30.0-34.9), 7.5% were class II obese (BMI 35.0-39.9), and 3.5% were class III obese (BMI \u2265 40). The overall stroke and mortality rates were 1.4% and 0.6%, respectively. On univariable analysis, there were U-shaped relationships between death (P = .017) and stroke (P = .029), with the lowest incidence in overweight and class I obese patients. The incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) (P = .021) increased incrementally with increasing BMI. On multivariable analysis, class I obesity was the only variable associated with decreased risk of stroke (odds ratio [OR], 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.83; P = .007). Independent risk factors for stroke were previous transient ischemic attack (OR, 1.97; P = .006), American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 to 5 (OR, 1.62; P = .010), surgery performed by a nonvascular surgeon (OR, 1.85; P = .015), and hemiplegia (OR, 1.97; P = .018). There was also a trend, although not statistically significant, toward decreased mortality risk associated with class I obesity (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, .26-1.08; P = .080). Class II obesity was associated with an increased risk of SSI compared with normal weight (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.01-4.82; P = .047). BMI category was not associated with the risk of myocardial infarction.\nAn obesity paradox exists for stroke and mortality after CEA; for stroke, but not mortality, this protective association was independent of patient demographics and comorbidities. Obesity is not a contraindication to CEA, and surgeons may safely undertake CEA in obese patients when indicated.",

The incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) (P = .021) increased incrementally with increasing BMI. On multivariable analysis, class I obesity was the only variable associated with decreased risk of stroke (odds ratio [OR], 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.83; P = .007). Independent risk factors for stroke were previous transient ischemic attack (OR, 1.97; P = .006), American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 to 5 (OR, 1.62; P = .010), surgery performed by a nonvascular surgeon (OR, 1.85; P = .015), and hemiplegia (OR, 1.97; P = .018). There was also a trend, although not statistically significant, toward decreased mortality risk associated with class I obesity (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, .26-1.08; P = .080). Class II obesity was associated with an increased risk of SSI compared with normal weight (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.01-4.82; P = .047). BMI category was not associated with the risk of myocardial infarction.",

    "abstract": "The management of acute aortic aneurysm rupture or dissection (AARD) requires specific medical expertise, diagnostic techniques, and therapeutic options, not always available in all hospitals through the entire week. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether an association exists between weekday (WD) or weekend (WE) admission and mortality for patients with ARRD.\nBased on the database of routinely collected hospital admissions of the region of Emilia Romagna (RER) of Italy, we examined the discharge sheets of all patients with AARD (January 1999 to December 2009). The risk of in-hospital death was calculated for admissions on the WE compared with the admissions during a WD.\nThe analysis considered 4559 events in 4461 patients. AARD admissions were most frequent on Monday (14.7%) and Friday (14.8%) and less frequent on Saturday (12.6%). The percentage of events admitted on Sunday/holiday was 15.0%, whereas the distribution of death rate with respect to day of admission was significantly different (\u03c7(2) = 23.472; P < .001) with the highest frequency peak on Sunday/holiday (17.4%) and the lowest on Tuesday (12.9%). WE admissions were associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality (43.4%) than WD admissions (36.9%, P < .001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that WE admission was an independent risk factor for increased in-hospital mortality odds ratio 1.318; 95% confidence interval, 1.144-1.517; P < .001).\nOur findings show that hospitalization for AARD on WE is associated with a significantly higher mortality rate than hospitalization on WD. Further studies are needed to investigate whether ensuring optimal diagnostic and therapeutic approaches during the entire week might improve the overall survival of patients with ARRD.",

    "abstract": "The anticoagulant treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has been historically directed toward the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism. However, such treatment imperfectly protects against late manifestations of the postthrombotic syndrome. By restoring venous patency and preserving valvular function, early thrombus removal strategies can potentially decrease postthrombotic morbidity.\nA committee of experts in venous disease was charged by the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum to develop evidence-based practice guidelines for early thrombus removal strategies, including catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, and surgical thrombectomy.\nEvidence-based recommendations are based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant literature, supplemented when necessary by less rigorous data. Recommendations are made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, incorporating the strength of the recommendation (strong: 1; weak: 2) and an evaluation of the level of the evidence (A to C).\nOn the basis of the best evidence currently available, we recommend against routine use of the term \"proximal venous thrombosis\" in favor of more precise characterization of thrombi as involving the iliofemoral or femoropopliteal venous segments (Grade 1A). We further suggest the use of early thrombus removal strategies in ambulatory patients with good functional capacity and a first episode of iliofemoral DVT of <14 days in duration (Grade 2C) and strongly recommend their use in patients with limb-threatening ischemia due to iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction (Grade 1A). We suggest pharmacomechanical strategies over catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis alone if resources are available and that surgical thrombectomy be considered if thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated (Grade 2C).\nMost data regarding early thrombus removal strategies are of low quality but do suggest patient-important benefits with respect to reducing postthrombotic morbidity. We anticipate revision of these guidelines as additional evidence becomes available.",

    "abstract": "In patients with Marfan syndrome, the complications of aortic degeneration, including dissection, aneurysm, and rupture represent the main cause of mortality. Although contemporary management of ascending aortic disease requires open surgical reconstruction, endovascular repair is now available for management of descending thoracic and abdominal aortic pathology (ie, thoracic endovascular aortic repair [TEVAR], endovascular aneurysm repair [EVAR]). The short- and long-term benefit of endovascular repair in Marfan patients remains largely unproven. We examine our outcomes after EVAR in this patient population.\nAll patients with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome who were treated with TEVAR/EVAR were evaluated in a retrospective review. Perioperative, procedure-specific and patient covariate data were aggregated. Primary endpoints were overall mortality and procedural success as divided into three categories: (1) successful therapy, (2) primary failure, or (3) secondary failure.\nBetween 2000 and June 2010, 16 patients were identified as having undergone 19 TEVAR/EVAR procedures. These included three emergent operations (two for acute dissection/malperfusion and one for anastomotic disruption early after open repair). All 16 patients had previously undergone at least one (range, 1-5) open operation of the ascending aorta or arch at a time interval from 33 years to 1 week prior to the index endovascular repair. During a median follow-up of 9.3 months (range, 0-46 months), there were four deaths (25%). Six patients (38%) had successful endovascular interventions. Despite early success, there was one death in this group at 1 month postintervention. Seven patients (44%) experienced primary treatment failure with five undergoing open conversion and one undergoing left subclavian coil embolization (the seventh was lost to follow-up and presented 4 months later in cardiac arrest and expired without repair). There were three deaths in the primary treatment failure group. Two patients experienced secondary treatment failure. One underwent the index TEVAR for acute dissection with malperfusion and required a subsequent TEVAR for more distal aortic pathology. He is stable without disease progression. The other patient underwent open conversion after a second EVAR with four-vessel \"chimney\" stent grafts and is stable with his entire native aorta having been replaced.\nAortic disease associated with Marfan syndrome is a complex clinical problem and many patients require remedial procedures. Endovascular therapy can provide a useful adjunct or bridge to open surgical treatment in selected patients. However, failure of endovascular therapy is common, and its use should be judicious with close follow-up to avoid delay if open surgical repair is required.",

    "abstract": "The primary goal of this study was to determine whether exposure to endovascular simulator training increases interest in vascular surgery among medical students. Secondary goals were to determine whether interest in vascular surgery is inversely related to the time after exposure, to identify factors associated with interest, and to identify students' characteristics that positively influence performance metrics.\nThis was a prospective, randomized, crossover study comprising 80 medical students who were randomized into group A (n = 40) and group B (n = 40). Participants completed a survey of their interest in vascular surgery and attitudinal factors using Vascular Surgery Interest Form (VSIF) before exposure to the simulator (pretest). At 1 month after exposure of group A to the simulator, both groups were tested using VSIF (test). Upon completion of testing, group B was exposed to simulator training, whereas group A received no further training. At 2 months after exposure of group B to the simulator, both groups were posttested using VSIF, which asked the students' level of interest in vascular surgery using a 1 to 10 scale. Performance metrics were recorded during each exposure. Differences among cohort demographics were determined using Pearson \u03c7(2) analysis. Differences in interest were determined with paired sample correlations. Linear regression and analysis of variance were used to correlate VSIF responses with interest and the performance metrics.\nBoth student cohorts had significant increases in interest after exposure to simulation. In group A, test interest (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) was significantly higher than pretest and posttest interests (5.51 \u00b1 1.73 vs 4.00 \u00b1 1.88 vs 4.18 \u00b1 1.82; P < .05).

    "abstract": "Recent randomized controlled trials have shown that age significantly affects the outcome of carotid revascularization procedures. This study used data from the Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Registry (VR) to report the influence of age on the comparative effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS).\nVR collects provider-reported data on patients using a Web-based database. Patients were stratified by age and symptoms. The primary end point was the composite outcome of death, stroke, or myocardial infarction (MI) at 30 days.\nAs of December 7, 2010, there were 1347 CEA and 861 CAS patients aged < 65 years and 4169 CEA and 2536 CAS patients aged \u2265 65 years. CAS patients in both age groups were more likely to have a disease etiology of radiation or restenosis, be symptomatic, and have more cardiac comorbidities. In patients aged <65 years, the primary end point (5.23% CAS vs 3.56% CEA; P = .065) did not reach statistical significance. Subgroup analyses showed that CAS had a higher combined death/stroke/MI rate (4.44% vs 2.10%; P < .031) in asymptomatic patients but there was no difference in the symptomatic (6.00% vs 5.47%; P = .79) group. In patients aged \u2265 65 years, CEA had lower rates of death (0.91% vs 1.97%; P < .01), stroke (2.52% vs 4.89%; P < .01), and composite death/stroke/MI (4.27% vs 7.14%; P < .01). CEA in patients aged \u2265 65 years was associated with lower rates of the primary end point in symptomatic (5.27% vs 9.52%; P < .01) and asymptomatic (3.31% vs 5.27%; P < .01) subgroups. After risk adjustment, CAS patients aged \u2265 65 years were more likely to reach the primary end point.\nCompared with CEA, CAS resulted in inferior 30-day outcomes in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients aged \u2265 65 years. These findings do not support the widespread use of CAS in patients aged \u2265 65 years.",

    "abstract": "Aneurysmal regression is a reliable marker for long-lasting success after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The aim of this study was to identify the preoperative factors that can predictably lead to aneurysmal sac regression after EVAR, according to the reporting standards of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the International Society of Cardiovascular Surgery (SVS/ISCVS).\nFrom 199 patients treated by EVAR between 2000 and 2009, 164 completed computed tomography angiographies and duplex scan follow-up images were available. All computed tomography angiographies for enrolled patients in this retrospective study were analyzed with Endosize software (Therenva, Rennes, France) to provide spatially correct 3-dimensional data in accordance with SVS/ISCVS recommendations. Anatomic parameters were graded according to the relevant severity grades. A severity score was calculated at the aortic neck, the abdominal aortic aneurysm, and the iliac arteries. Clinical and demographic factors were studied. Patients with aneurysmal regression >5 mm were assigned to group A (mean age, 71.4 \u00b1 8.9 years) and the others to group B (76.3 \u00b1 8.3 years).\nAneurysmal regression occurred in 66 patients (40.2%; group A). Univariate analyses showed smaller severity scores at the aortic neck (P = .02) and the iliac arteries (P = .002) in group A and calcifications and thrombus were less significant at the aortic neck (P = .003 and P = .02) and at the iliac arteries (P = .001 and P = .02), and inferior mesenteric artery patency was less frequent (68.2% vs 82.7%, P = .04). Two multivariate analyses were done: one considered the scores and the other the variables included in the scores. In the first, the patients of group A were younger (P = .002) and aortic neck calcifications were less significant (P = .007). In the second, group A patients were younger (P < .001) and the aortic neck scores were smaller (P = .04). There was no difference between the two groups in the type of implanted endoprosthesis or in the follow-up (group A: 46.4 \u00b1 24 months; group B: 47.2 \u00b1 22 months; P = .35).\nIn this study, the young age of the patients and their aortic neck quality, in particular the absence of neck calcification, appear to have been the main factors affecting aneurysm shrinkage, such that they represent a target population for the improvement of EVAR results.",

    "abstract": "We report the midterm results of external iliac artery reconstruction in 25 high-performance cyclists.\nCyclists undergoing arterial reconstruction for symptomatic external iliac arteriopathy at a single institution between October 2004 and August 2010 were identified. With Institutional Review Board approval, data were collected from medical record review and telephone interview. Results were analyzed with \u03c7(2) or independent t-test.\nTwenty-five patients (31 limbs) underwent operation, which included arterial reconstruction with or without inguinal ligament release. The average patient age at operation was 43.8 \u00b1 5.0 for graft and 35.1 \u00b1 1.9 for patch (P = .08). The average time from competitive cycling until operation was 18.2 \u00b1 5.8 years for graft and 20.0 \u00b1 2.5 for patch repairs (NS). Patients included 14 males and 11 females. There were 23 unilateral and four bilateral arterial reconstructions, including 26 patch angioplasties for localized disease and five interposition grafts for extensive disease; three patients underwent contralateral reconstruction as a separate procedure. Concomitant ipsilateral inguinal ligament release was performed in 25 patients (28 limbs), with contralateral release done in 12 patients (12 limbs). Three patients with isolated ligament release required subsequent arterial intervention. Follow-up averaged 32 months (range, 2-74). Primary patency for all reconstructions was 100%; the four reoperations (five limbs; one bilateral) were for symptom recurrence, two postgraft and two postangioplasty. Three reoperations were for recurrent intimal hyperplasia, one for disease distal to the anastomosis, and one for concomitant atherosclerotic disease. Based on available data, postexercise ankle-brachial indices were improved in 18 of 23 limbs. Seventeen patients completed questions regarding satisfaction: 10 were satisfied or very satisfied (zero graft, 10 patch; P = .25), while four were unsatisfied (three graft, two patch; P = .017, including one patient with both a patch and graft repair). All 20 patients for whom follow-up data were available are still cycling, 10 competitively. Two of the four reoperated patients were unsatisfied; all four are still cycling, one competitively.\nExternal iliac arteriopathy is a disease of prolonged, sustained, and repetitive trauma. Patch angioplasty yields a low rate of reoperation, more satisfied patients, return to competitive activity, and improvement in postexercise ankle-brachial indices. Interposition grafting is associated with slightly older patients, more extensive disease, and less satisfying results. Intimal hyperplasia is the most frequent complication necessitating reoperation. Both the decision to pursue arterial reconstruction and patient expectations must be tempered by the pattern of disease and the potential for unsatisfactory results.",

    "abstract": "This prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial determined whether an optimal exercise program length exists to efficaciously change claudication onset time (COT) and peak walking time (PWT) in patients with peripheral artery disease and claudication.\nThe study randomized 142 patients to supervised exercise (n = 106) or a usual care control group (n = 36), with 80 completing the exercise program and 27 completing the control intervention. The exercise program consisted of intermittent walking to nearly maximal claudication pain 3 days per week. COT and PWT were the primary outcomes obtained from a treadmill exercise test at baseline and bimonthly during the study.\nAfter exercise, changes in COT (P < .001) and PWT (P < .001) were consistently greater than changes after the control intervention. In the exercise program, COT and PWT increased from baseline to month 2 (P < .05) and from months 2 to 4 (P < .05) but did not significantly change from months 4 to 6 (P > .05). When changes were expressed per mile walked during the first 2 months, middle 2 months, and final 2 months of exercise, COT and PWT only increased during the first 2 months (P < .05).\nExercise-mediated gains in COT and PWT occur rapidly within the first 2 months of exercise rehabilitation and are maintained with further training. The clinical significance is that a relatively short 2-month exercise program may be preferred to a longer program to treat claudication because adherence is higher, costs associated with personnel and use of facilities are lower per patient, and more patients can be trained for a given amount of personnel time and resource utilization.",

The aim of this prospective single-center nonrandomized study was to describe the changes of BRS in the early postoperative period after eversion carotid endarterectomy (E-CEA).\nSpontaneous BRS and hemodynamic parameters such as blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were evaluated preoperatively as well as postoperatively after 1 and 3 days using a noninvasive sequential cross-correlation method. Additionally, any modification in vasoactive medication due to BP derangement in the postoperative period was noted. Due to non-normal distribution of BRS, HR, and TPR samples, all measured values were expressed as medians with interquartile range (IQR), and a nonparametric test (Friedman) was performed. After adjustment for multiple testing, differences were considered statistically significant when the two-tailed P value was less than .0036.\nThirty-five patients (mean age, 71 years) with symptomatic or asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis were included. The BRS significantly decreased to a lower level 24 hours after surgery (4.71 ms/mm Hg [3.02-6.1]) than preoperatively (5.95 ms/mm Hg [4.68-10.86]; P < .0001), resulting in a within-patient difference of -2.46 ms/mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], -8.38 - -1.52). This difference (95% CI, [- 1.58 (-8.24 - -0.80)]) persisted at the 72-hour measurements (5.63 ms/mm Hg [3.23-7.69]; P = .0005). The HR, reflecting the sympathetic activity, increased 24 hours after the operation (69 bpm [61.3-77.7]) compared with preoperative values (63 bpm [57.9-73.2]; P = .005) (within-patient difference [95% CI] 3.7 [1.5-8.5]), and this increase reached significance at 72 hours (69 bpm [65.4-77.5]; P = .001) (within-patient difference [95% CI] 5.5 [2.3-8.8]). Values of systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, mean arterial pressure, CO, and TPR were not significantly different between pre- and postoperative measurements. Overall, 23 (66%) patients developed significant postoperative hypertension requiring aggressive management with additional medications.\nE-CEA might have a decreasing influence on BRS, leading to increased sympathetic activity. Investigations of the longer-term effects of impaired BRS are warranted. These findings should be interpreted with caution, noting the limitation of an absent control group.",

    "abstract": "Surgical management of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (NTOS) is controversial due to the lack of predictors of success and difficulties in patient selection. We sought to examine the effects of patient demographics, etiology, duration of symptoms, and the selective use of lidocaine and botulinum toxin anterior scalene blocks on outcomes of patients undergoing transaxillary decompression with first rib resection and scalenotomy for NTOS.\nPatients with NTOS who had failed physical therapy and had transaxillary decompression between 2003 and 2009 were reviewed retrospectively from a prospectively maintained database. Patients were stratified to age groups < 40 and \u2265 40 years old. Bivariate and multivariate statistical models of analysis were used.\nOne hundred fifty-nine procedures (16 patients bilateral; three patients with cervical ribs; 84.3% women; median age, 37 years; range, 21-64 years) were identified. Ninety-six patients were < 40 and 63 were \u2265 40 years old. Etiology was similar in both groups: trauma 43% vs 46% and chronic repetitive motion 57% vs 54%. Duration of symptoms was less in the <40 group (38.4 vs 66 months; P < .05). More patients in the \u2265 40 group had other spine, shoulder, or arm operations (38% vs 18%; P < .05). Median follow-up for the cohort was 12 months. Transaxillary decompression was more likely to relieve symptoms in patients <40 vs \u2265 40 years old (90% vs 78%; P < .05). Lidocaine blocks were positive in 89% (49 of 55 patients) in the <40 group and 93% (43 of 46 patients) in the \u2265 40 group. After adjusting for patient presenting factors in multivariate analysis, the impact of a successful lidocaine block in patients \u2265 40 years old was greater than in patients < 40 years old (improvement of surgical success of 14% in the > 40 group vs 7% in the < 40 group; P = .05). Botulinum toxin blocks were successful in less patients, 38% (eight of 21 patients) in the < 40 group and 52% (12 of 23 patients) in the \u2265 40 group but were not predictive of symptom relief after transaxillary decompression.\nAlthough patients with NTOS < 40 years old achieve more symptom relief overall after transaxillary decompression as compared to patients \u2265 40 years old, the selective use of lidocaine blocks is more beneficial in predicting surgical success in patients \u2265 40 years old given that younger patients < 40 years old seem to do well regardless.",

    "abstract": "Although the superficial femoral vein (SFV) is an accepted treatment for aortic graft infections, this conduit also has potential uses in other areas. Herein, we evaluate our experience using the SFV for arterial and venous bypasses and the arteriovenous (AV) fistula for dialysis access.\nBetween 1999 and 2011, 42 patients underwent a bypass or a thigh AV fistula using the SFV (31 arterial, four central venous, six AV fistulas, and one common carotid-to-vertebral bypass). Indications for arterial bypass included infected graft (20), critical limb ischemia (nine), and failed bypass (six). Indications for central venous bypass were: superior vena cava syndrome (two), vessel reconstruction due to tumor encasement (one), and central vein occlusion from thoracic outlet syndrome (one). All AV fistulas were created after patients sustained bilateral subclavian vein occlusions from failed upper extremity access. The common carotid-to-vertebral bypass was created due to an occluded vertebral artery with resultant stroke.\nKaplan-Meier cumulative patency curves were used. The primary patency rates at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years were 97.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 92.41-100), 74.6% (95% CI, 57.89-96.23), and 66.4% (95% CI, 47.06-93.53), respectively. The assisted primary patency rates at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years were 100% (95% CI, 100-100), 97.1% (95% CI, 91.54-100), and 89% (95% CI, 74.29-100), respectively. Secondary patency rates at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years were 100% (95% CI, 100-100), 97.1% (95% CI, 91.54-100), and 89% (95% CI, 74.29-100), respectively. Limb salvage rates at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years were 97.3% (95% CI, 92.21-100), 93.6% (95% CI, 78.35-100), and 93.6% (95% CI, 78.35-100), respectively. Survival rates at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years were 97.6% (95% CI, 92.95-100), 86% (95% CI, 75.3-98.3), and 86% (95% CI, 75.3-98.3), respectively. Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 8.7 years (mean time, 21 months). Complications occurred in 22 patients (52%) and included wound complications (n = 19; 45.2%); deep vein thrombosis (n = 1; 2.4%); anastomotic breakdown (n = 1; 2.4%); hematoma (n = 4; 9.5%); pulmonary embolism (n = 2; 4.8%); and compartment syndrome (n = 2; 4.8%).\nThe SFV is a durable conduit for uses beyond aortic reconstruction and should be considered when the great saphenous vein is not available or size match is a concern. However, wound complications remain a problem.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy of three available treatments for acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT): systemic anticoagulation, surgical thrombectomy, and catheter-directed thrombolysis.\nWe searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and Scopus) and sought additional references from experts. Eligible studies enrolled participants with acute iliofemoral DVT and measured the outcomes of interest. Reviewers working independently in duplicate extracted study characteristics, quality, and outcome data (death, pulmonary embolism, local complications, hemorrhagic complications, postthrombotic syndrome, pain, quality of life, and surrogate markers of venous function such as valve competence and patency). We pooled relative risks (RRs) from each study using the random effects model and estimated the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Bayesian indirect comparison techniques were used to compare thrombectomy to catheter-directed thrombolysis.\nWe found 15 unique studies that fulfilled eligibility criteria. When compared to systemic anticoagulation, thrombectomy was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of developing postthrombotic syndrome (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.87), venous reflux (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.46-0.99), and a trend for reduction in the risk of venous obstruction (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.60-1.19). When compared to systemic anticoagulation, pharmacologic catheter-directed thrombolysis was associated with statistically significant reduction in the risk of postthrombotic syndrome (RR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07-0.48), venous obstruction (RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.18-0.37), and a trend for reduction in the risk of venous reflux (RR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.16-1.00). Overall, the quality of evidence was low; downgraded due to the observational nature of the majority of studies, lack of comparability of study cohorts at baseline, loss to follow-up, imprecision, and indirectness of outcomes (surrogacy). There were insufficient data to compare the outcomes of thrombectomy to catheter-directed thrombolysis.\nLow-quality evidence suggests that surgical thrombectomy decreases the incidence of postthrombotic syndrome and venous reflux. Catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis decreases the incidence of postthrombotic syndrome and venous obstruction.",

Overall, the quality of evidence was low; downgraded due to the observational nature of the majority of studies, lack of comparability of study cohorts at baseline, loss to follow-up, imprecision, and indirectness of outcomes (surrogacy). There were insufficient data to compare the outcomes of thrombectomy to catheter-directed thrombolysis.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have examined factors that influence an individual's decision to enter an academic medical career after residency training. We sought to evaluate whether sex, ethnicity, child care issues, and debt burden influenced residents' choice for a career in academic vascular surgery.\nA 39-item Web survey, designed to elucidate which factors motivated residents to seek a career in academic vascular surgery, was sent to 295 vascular surgery residents currently enrolled in Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education-accredited training programs.\nA total of 128 responses (43%) were received. Of these, 53% of respondents were white and 47% were nonwhite and 34 (27%) were women and 94 (73%) were men. Fifty-seven percent of minorities anticipate a career in academic vascular surgery. There were no statistical differences between sex and ethnicity for factors influencing career choice, including training paradigm, presence of a life partner or dependents, mentorship role, participation in research, service, and teaching, anticipated salary, and debt burden (P > .05). Seventy-seven percent of respondents carry significant debt; of those with debt, 81% owe >$100,000 and 40% owe >$200,000. Seventy-three percent of 0+5 trainees anticipated choosing an academic practice compared with 42% of 5+2 trainees (P < .01). Respondents planning an academic career cited procedural variation, breadth and depth of practice/tertiary referral experience, and research opportunities as the most important drivers of career choice. Income potential, strength of the job market, and child care needs were deemed less important.\nThis study shows that academic vascular surgery is a popular career option for current vascular surgery trainees, especially those in 0+5 programs. Choosing a career in academic vascular surgery appears not to be influenced by sex, ethnicity, child care concerns, salary expectations, or debt burden, even though most trainees carry enormous debt. The data imply future academic vascular surgeons will likely have greater gender and ethnic variability than is currently seen.",

    "abstract": "Compression therapy is not common for venous leg ulcer patients in Hong Kong.\nThis randomized controlled trial compared the clinical effectiveness of compression bandaging using four-layer bandaging (4LB) or short-stretch bandaging (SSB) and usual care (moist wound healing dressing without compression). The 24-week study looked at venous leg ulcer patients aged >60 years in a community setting. The primary parameter was time to ulcer healing. Secondary parameters were ulcer area and pain reduction comparing week 0 (start) vs week 24 (end), measuring results per group and between groups. Intention-to-treat analysis involved descriptive statistics, survival analysis, and repeated measures analysis of variance. The log-rank test was used for univariable analysis. All withdrawn patients had a negative outcome score over the whole study duration.\nOf 321 patients who received randomized treatment, 45 (14%) did not complete the 24-week study period. At 24 weeks, Kaplan-Meier analysis on healing time was statistically significant (P < .001) in favor of the compression groups. The mean (SD) healing time in the SSB group (9.9 [0.77]) was shorter than that of the 4LB group (10.4 [0.80]) and the usual care group (18.3 [0.86]). Pain reduction was significant (P < .001) for the compression-treated groups only.\nCompression bandaging was more effective than usual care without compression. Both compression systems were safe and feasible for venous ulcer patients in a community setting in Hong Kong.",

    "abstract": "This study reviews the results of en bloc resection of the inferior vena cava (IVC) for malignant tumor excision and reconstruction.\nA prospective database was reviewed. IVC resection was categorized as suprarenal, perirenal, infrarenal, or extensive (>one segment resected). Repairs were divided into primary, patch, or circumferential. Tumor type, perioperative morbidity, mortality, and graft patency were recorded.\nBetween 1990 and 2011, 47 patients (21 women; mean age, 56; range, 35-89 years) underwent IVC resection for en bloc tumor excision. Sarcomas were most common (36 [77%]: 30 primary IVC). Eleven patients had primary IVC repair, nine patch repair (two autogenous), and 27 had circumferential replacement with a polytetrafluoroethylene ringed graft. Extensive IVC reconstruction in 18 patients included the entire IVC, with renal (RV) and hepatic vein reimplantation in eight; suprarenal and perirenal in six (seven RVs reimplanted); and infrarenal and perirenal in four (four RVs reimplanted). Nine single-segment IVC replacements were infrarenal. Morbidity was 10.6%: one each with bowel obstruction, chyle leak, renal failure with complete recovery (left RV reimplant, right nephrectomy), reoperation for bleeding, and IVC graft thrombosis. Morbidity did not differ by type of reconstruction. There was no mortality. Follow-up ranged from 1.5 to 216 months (18 years) with a mean of 3.5 years. Computed tomography or duplex scans were available in 28 of 47 patients and in 15 of 27 patients in group 3 at a mean follow-up of 36 and 20 months, respectively. One IVC graft thrombosis was documented at 10 months after chemotherapy/sepsis. Tumor recurrence caused three graft stenoses. Cumulative 5-year patency in group 3 was 80% (imaging) and 92% (clinical). Lower extremity edema was universally avoided. Cumulative 5-year survival for the series was 45% \u00b1 8.5%. Mean long-term survival was 5.8 \u00b1 0.56 years (range, 4 months-17 years), with a significant difference between primary or patch (mean, 6.5 years) and circumferential or extensive repair (mean, 4.2 years; P < .005). Cumulative (47% vs 52%) and mean (3.1 vs 3.6 years; P > .12) survival was similar between patients with single-segment and extensive IVC resection and replacement.\nIVC resection and reconstruction for en bloc tumor excision is safe, even when extensive repairs are necessary. Replacement of the IVC with prosthetic graft avoids extremity venous complications and likely contributes to quality of survival. Survival depends on tumor behavior and degree of IVC involvement, where primary and patch repair has a better prognosis than circumferential resection.",

    "abstract": "To quantify longitudinal changes in intra-arterial septum (IS) motion with two-dimensional (2D) phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (2D pcMRI) in type B aortic dissections (AD) to improve the understanding of AD and its midterm development.\nFrom a database of 42 patients who underwent a dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination at the Acute Aortic Treatment Center of The Methodist DeBakey Heart & Vascular Center, 2D pcMRI image data was available from 10 patients with type B AD for both short-term (mean, 6.6 days; range, 1-10 days; n = 7) and midterm follow-up (mean, 155 days; range, 60-324; n = 5). IS motion was quantified as motion of IS boundary points averaged over the cardiac cycle. Relative change in IS motion was expressed as percent change compared with initial presentation. Maximum IS extension (true lumen [TL] expansion) and contraction (TL compression), IS fraction in phase with aortic flow and correlation of IS motion with aortic flow (IS compliance) were quantified.\nIS motion at initial presentation was 0.68 \u00b1 0.2 mm and was reduced at short-term (0.48 \u00b1 0.3 mm; P = .07) and midterm (0.5 \u00b1 0.2 mm; P = .1) follow-up. Trend in relative change of IS motion was variable during short-term follow-up: reduced in three subjects (-75% \u00b1 6%) and elevated in four subjects (48% \u00b1 23%). During midterm follow-up, relative change in IS motion was reduced in four subjects (28% \u00b1 19%) and slightly elevated in one (6.2%). IS contraction decreased with follow-up while IS extension slightly increased. Fraction of IS moving in phase with aortic flow increased but IS compliance decreased, suggesting increasing IS stiffness.\nReduction of IS motion in AD is seen with short-term and midterm follow-up. Intersubject variability of this trend is high at short-term follow-up but low at midterm follow-up. Detailed analysis of IS motion parameters indicate reduction of IS contraction and IS compliance with time. This has potential implications for endovascular management of type B aortic dissections, as expansion of aortic stent grafts can be limited by a stiff IS.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of remote neuromonitoring as an adjunct to spinal cord protection during surgical repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.\nFour aortic centers in three European countries participated in this prospective observational study. A similar surgical protocol was used in all centers, including assessment of spinal cord function by means of monitoring motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). MEP information was evaluated at one central neurophysiologic department in Maastricht, The Netherlands. Transfer of MEP data from all operating rooms to Maastricht was arranged by Internet connections. In all patients, the protective and surgical strategies to prevent paraplegia were based on MEPs. The on-site surgeons reacted in real time to the interpretation and feedback of the neurophysiologist.\nBetween March 2009 and May 2011, 130 patients (85 men) were treated by open surgical repair. Extent of aneurysms was equally distributed among the centers. Neuromonitoring was technically stabile and successful in all patients. The transfer of data from the operating room in the different vascular centers was undisturbed and without any technical problems. By maintaining a mean distal aortic pressure of 60 mm Hg, MEPs were undisturbed in 65 patients (50%). In another 65 patients (50%), significant changes in MEPs prompted the surgical teams to initiate additional protective and surgical strategies to restore spinal cord perfusion. These measures were not effective in five patients (3.8%), and acute paraplegia resulted. Delayed paraplegia occurred in 10 patients (7.7%) but improved in three and recovered completely in another three. No false-negative or false-positive MEP recordings were experienced.\nRemote neuromonitoring of spinal cord function during open repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms as a telemedicine technique is feasible and effective. It allows centralization of expertise and saves individual centers from investing in complex technology. The value of monitoring MEPs was confirmed in different aortic centers, resulting in adequate neurologic outcome after extensive aortic surgical procedures.",

Neuromonitoring was technically stabile and successful in all patients. The transfer of data from the operating room in the different vascular centers was undisturbed and without any technical problems. By maintaining a mean distal aortic pressure of 60 mm Hg, MEPs were undisturbed in 65 patients (50%). In another 65 patients (50%), significant changes in MEPs prompted the surgical teams to initiate additional protective and surgical strategies to restore spinal cord perfusion. These measures were not effective in five patients (3.8%), and acute paraplegia resulted. Delayed paraplegia occurred in 10 patients (7.7%) but improved in three and recovered completely in another three. No false-negative or false-positive MEP recordings were experienced.",

    "abstract": "Explosive blasts are common in the modern military environment. These blasts incorporate a concussive component (primary blast injury) and a penetrating component (secondary blast injury). Penetrating injuries are the leading cause of death and injury in these attacks. This review characterizes the vascular injuries associated with penetrating blast injuries to the neck and provides recommendations on the early management of these casualties for the surgeon unfamiliar with these injuries.\nThe Landstuhl Regional Medical Center Trauma Registry was queried for admissions from January 1, 2006, to June 30, 2010, coded for a penetrating injury to the neck caused by a blast mechanism. Medical records were abstracted from the patient's initial presentation and care through the deployed military medical system. We recorded the vascular injuries, diagnostic studies, operative events, and early postinjury course for all identified patients.\nQuery of the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center Trauma Registry initially identified 252 patients, of which 53 were excluded because their injuries arose from other mechanisms or were only superficial. Among the remaining 199 patients, 38 (19.1%) sustained 44 vascular injuries requiring treatment. Compelling physical examination findings (\"hard signs\") were present in 15 (7.5%), who underwent immediate neck exploration. Another 12 patients also underwent neck exploration without any prior imaging studies. Computed tomography (CT) or CT angiography (CTA) examinations were done in 172 patients without hard-sign physical examination findings. Of these, the result of the imaging study was negative in 106 patients, and no further investigation or treatment for cervical vascular trauma was initiated. Of 66 patients who underwent CT/CTA before operative neck exploration, CT/CTA identified a vascular injury in 26 that was later confirmed on neck exploration. The combination of physical examination and CT/CTA resulted in a sensitivity of 96.3% and a specificity of 97.2% in diagnosing cervical vascular injury.\nPenetrating cervical wounds from war-related blast trauma are associated with potentially life-threatening vascular injuries. The presenting physical examination, availability of CT/CTA, local surgical expertise, and tactical combat situation all contribute to surgical decision making in these patients. In patients without hard signs of vascular trauma and a normal CT/CTA of the neck, there is no evidence to support mandatory surgical neck explorations or further immediate diagnostic studies to exclude cervical vascular injury.",

    "abstract": "Type II endoleak (T2EL) with aneurysm expansion is believed to place patients at risk for aneurysm-related mortality (ARM). Treatment with glue and/or coil embolization of the aneurysm sac, inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), and lumbar branches via translumbar or transarterial approaches has been utilized to ablate such endoleaks, and thus decrease ARM. We evaluated the midterm results of percutaneous endovascular treatment of T2EL with aneurysm expansion.\nSingle-institution, 5-year (January 2003 to August 2008) retrospective study of all endovascular interventions for T2EL with sac expansion. Blinded, independent review of all available pre- and post-T2EL intervention computed tomography (CT) scans was performed. Aneurysm sac maximal transverse diameters and aneurysm sac growth rates prior to and following T2EL intervention were analyzed.\nForty-two patients (34 male, eight female; mean age, 75) underwent T2EL intervention at 26 \u00b1 20 months after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and were subsequently followed for 23 \u00b1 20 months. Seven out of 42 patients (17%) underwent repeat T2EL intervention. Interventions included 44 translumbar sac embolizations, and transcatheter embolizations of nine IMAs and seven lumbar/hypogastric arteries. Aneurysm diameter was 6.1 \u00b1 1.6 cm at EVAR, 6.6 \u00b1 1.5 cm at initial T2EL treatment, and 6.9 \u00b1 1.7 cm at last follow-up. There were no significant differences in the rates of aneurysm sac growth pre- and post-T2EL treatment. At last follow-up imaging, recurrent or persistent T2EL was noted in 72% of patients. Of 42 patients, nine (21%) received operative endoluminal correction of occult type I or type III endoleaks that were diagnosed during the T2EL angiographic intervention. There were no aneurysm ruptures or ARMs during follow-up; overall mortality for the 5-year study period was 24%.\nIn this series, percutaneous endovascular intervention for type II endoleak with aneurysm sac growth does not appear to alter the rate of aneurysm sac growth, and the majority of patients display persistent/recurrent endoleak. However, diagnostic angiographic evaluation may reveal unexpected type I and III endoleaks and is therefore recommended for all patients with T2EL and sac growth. While coil and glue embolization of aneurysm sac and selected branch vessels does not appear to yield benefit in our series, the diagnosis and subsequent definitive treatment of previously occult type I and III endoleaks may explain the absence of delayed rupture and ARM in our series.",

    "abstract": "Blunt abdominal aortic injury (BAAI) is a rare injury with less than 200 cases in the current reported world literature, mostly in case report format. We sought to describe the experience of a high-volume trauma center and to provide a contemporary review of the literature to better understand the natural history and management of this injury.\nThis was a retrospective review of patients with BAAI between 1996 and 2010. Data collected included demographics, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, type of intervention, subsequent imaging, and follow-up. BAAI was classified by the presence of external aortic contour abnormality noted as an intimal tear, large intimal flap, pseudoaneurysm, or free rupture. Abdominal aorta zones of injury were classified by possible surgical approaches as zone I (diaphragmatic hiatus to superior mesenteric artery [SMA]), zone II (includes SMA and renal arteries), and zone III (from the inferior aspect of the renal arteries to the aortic bifurcation).\nWe identified 28 individuals (68% male) with BAAI (median age, 28.5; range, 6-61 years). The median injury severity score was 45 (range, 16-75), and 39% were hypotensive at presentation. BAAI presented as intimal tear (21%), large intimal flap (39%), pseudoaneurysm (11%), and free rupture (29%). Zone III was the most common location of injury. Management depended on the location and type of injury: nonoperative (32%), open aortic repair (36%), endovascular repair (21%), and multimodality (10%). Overall mortality was 32%. Most deaths occurred during the initial operative exploration. The mortality rate of free aortic rupture was 100%. Intimal tears resolved or remained stable. Median follow-up was 15.5 months (range, 8 days-7.5 years). Vascular complications due to repair included a thrombosed access femoral artery during an endovascular repair and death of a patient who underwent a hybrid repair.\nThis is the largest BAAI series described in the English literature at one institution. BAAIs range from intimal tears to free rupture, with outcomes and management correlating with type and location of injury. Nonoperative management with blood pressure control using \u03b2-blockers coupled with antiplatelet therapy and close follow-up is successful in individuals with intimal tears with minimal thrombus formation because they remain stable or resolve on follow-up. Free rupture remains a devastating injury, with 100% mortality. For all other categories of aortic injury, successful repair correlates with a favorable prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Subclavian vein (SCV) compression in venous thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) has been attributed to various anatomic factors, but a potential role for costochondral degeneration in the underlying first rib has not been previously examined. The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency of costochondral calcification (CC), osteophytic degeneration (OD), and occult first rib fractures (FRFx) in patients with venous TOS.\nThirty-seven patients (21 male, 16 female) were referred for surgical treatment of venous TOS during a 12-month period, with a mean age of 30.7 \u00b1 1.8 year (range, 12-55). Thirteen (35%) had acute SCV effort thrombosis and 24 (65%) had chronic symptoms (>14 days). Twenty (54%) had undergone SCV thrombolysis, 11 (30%) had persistent SCV occlusion, and 10 (27%) had concomitant symptoms of neurogenic TOS. All patients underwent paraclavicular thoracic outlet decompression with complete resection of the first rib to the sternum, with 20 (54%) having concomitant SCV reconstruction. The presence or absence of CC, OD, and FRFx was determined by direct visual examination of the rib at operation and following debridement of the excised specimen.\nOne patient had a cervical rib but there were none with radiographic first rib abnormalities. In contrast, FRFx were observed at surgical resection in 16 of 37 patients (43%). All FRFx were small, nondisplaced, linear lesions located within an area of CC in the anterior rib, typically in association with OD and perivenous soft tissue thickening. The mean age of patients with FRFx was higher than those with a normal first rib (38.1 \u00b1 1.5 years vs 25.0 \u00b1 2.3 years; P < .0001), and FRFx were present in 16 of 21 (76%) patients \u2265 30 years of age but in no patients younger than 30 (P < .0001).\nA high proportion (43%) of patients with venous TOS exhibited CC, OD, and a previously undetected FRFx, including 76% of those over the age of 30. These lesions occur in the cartilaginous anterior rib where they are clinically occult and undetected by standard radiographic imaging. We postulate that age-related CC may predispose to OD and stress-induced FRFx, and that inflammation, fibrosis, and anatomic distortion in the surrounding soft tissues may contribute to SCV compression.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate folding in infrarenal stent grafts in relation to oversizing, barb angle, and barb length using computed tomography images of stent grafts deployed in explanted bovine aortas.\nComputed tomography data from an in vitro investigation on the effect of oversizing of 4% to 45% (n = 19), barb length of 2 to 7 mm (n = 11), and barb angle of 10\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 (n = 7) on device fixation were examined for instances of folding. Folding was classified as circumferential or longitudinal and quantified on an ordinal scale based on codified criteria. Cumulative fold ranking from 0 (no fold) to 6 (two severe folds) for each deployment was used as the measure of folding observed.\nOf the 37 cases, cumulative mean \u00b1 standard deviation fold ranking for stent grafts oversized >30% (n = 5) was significantly greater than the rest (3.4 \u00b1 1.7 vs 0.5 \u00b1 1.2, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test; P < .005). When barb length was varied from 2 to 7 mm (oversizing held at 10%-20%), folding was noted in one of 11 cases.

The pullout force was not significantly different between stent grafts with and without folding (5.4 \u00b1 1.95 vs 5.12 \u00b1 1.89 N, respectively; P > .5). At least one instance of folding was noted in the seven of seven (100%) stent grafts with oversizing >23.5% and in only five of 30 (14%) stent grafts with oversizing <23.5%.\nStent graft folding was prevalent when oversized >30%. Large variations in barb length and angle did not aggravate folding risk when oversized within the recommended range of 10% to 20%.",

    "abstract": "To determine if there are any differences in outcomes between infrarenal fixation (IF) and suprarenal fixation (SF) endograft systems for the endovascular treatment (endovascular aneurysm repair [EVAR]) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) with short, straight proximal aortic necks (<1.5 cm).\nA retrospective review of 1379 EVAR procedures was performed between the years of 2002 and 2009 at a single institution. The charts and radiographic images of all patients were reviewed. Patients who underwent EVAR with AAA morphology with short proximal necks were stratified into two groups: IF, Gore Excluder (W. L. Gore, Flagstaff, Ariz) group and SF, Cook Zenith (Cook, Bloomington, Ind) group. The primary end point for the study was the presence of proximal type 1 endoleaks. Secondary end points were graft migration at 1- and 2-year follow-up and aneurysm sac regression. The groups' demographics and comorbidities were also compared.\nA total of 1379 EVARS were performed during the study period and 84 were identified as having a short proximal aortic neck. Sixty patients were in the IF group and 24 in the SF group. The average follow-up period was 18.6 months (IF) and 18.5 months (SF). There was no difference in the average proximal neck length (1.19 cm IF vs 1.14 cm SF; P = not significant [NS]) or the preoperative AAA size (5.8 cm IF vs 5.9 cm SF; P = NS). There were no significant differences in age (76.6 years IF vs 74.8 years SF; P = .32), gender (IF 66.7% vs SF 21.88% men; P = .053), or length of stay (2.2 days IF vs 1.9 days SF; P = .39). The comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, and warfarin use) were also similar. There were five type 1a endoleaks in group IF and one in group SF (P = .44) identified at the 1-month follow-up; however, only one patient in the IF group underwent intervention for enlargement of the AAA sac. At 1 year, there was persistence of one type 1a endoleak in both groups, but these were deemed dead-end leaks as they did not fill the sac nor lead to aneurysm growth. There were no migrations (>0.5 cm) noted in either group. Sac regression was observed at an average rate of 0.24 cm/year in the IF group and 0.26 cm/year in the SF group (P = NS). There were no aneurysm ruptures during the study period.\nThere are no significant differences in endograft migration or in the incidence of early and late type 1a endoleaks between endografts that use IF (Gore Excluder) and SF (Cook Zenith) fixation for patients with short aortic necks undergoing EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Venous hypoxia has been postulated to contribute to varicose vein (VV) formation. Direct measurements of vein wall oxygen tension have previously demonstrated that the average minimum oxygen tensions were significantly lower in VVs compared with non-varicose veins (NVVs). Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are nuclear transcriptional factors that regulate the expression of several genes of oxygen homeostasis. This study aimed to investigate if hypoxia was associated with VVs by assessing the expression of HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, HIF target genes, and upstream HIF regulatory enzymes in VVs and NVVs, and their regulation by hypoxia.\nVVs and NVVs were surgically retrieved and immediately snap-frozen or used for organ culture preparation. The relative expression of HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, HIF target genes, and HIF regulatory enzymes in VVs and NVVs was analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and Western blot. VV and NVV organ ex vivo cultures were exposed to 16 hours of normoxia, hypoxia (oxygen tension 1%), or the hypoxia mimetic dimethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG) 1 mM in normoxia. The vein organ cultures were then analyzed for HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, and their target gene expression with Q-PCR and Western blot.\nHIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 mRNA were significantly upregulated in VVs compared with NVVs (89.8 \u00b1 18.6 vs 10.4 \u00b1 7.2 and 384.9 \u00b1 209.4 vs 8.1 \u00b1 4.2, respectively). HIF target gene mRNA expression was also significantly elevated in VVs compared with NVVs, namely glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1; 8.7 \u00b1 2.1 vs 1.0 \u00b1 0.3), carbonic anhydrase-9 (CA9; 8.5 \u00b1 2.1 vs 2.8 \u00b1 1.2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 7.5 \u00b1 2.1 vs 0.9 \u00b1 0.2), and BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP-3; 4.5 \u00b1 0.7 vs 1.4 \u00b1 0.3). The upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, and HIF target genes in VVs was also reflected at protein level. Of the HIF regulatory enzymes, the expression of prolyl-hydroxylase domain (PHD)-2 and PHD-3 was found to be elevated in VVs compared with NVVs. Exposure of VV and NVV organ cultures to hypoxia or DMOG was associated with increases in HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 protein and HIF target gene expression compared with normoxia only.\nThe study concluded, we believe for the first time, an increased activation of the HIF pathway, with upregulation of the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 transcription factors, and HIF target genes, in VVs compared with NVVs. Exposure of VVs and NVVs to hypoxic conditions was associated with increased expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 protein and HIF target genes. The data suggest that the HIF pathway may be associated with several pathophysiologic changes in the VV wall, and that hypoxia may be a feature contributing to VV pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Retrograde ascending aortic dissection (rAAD) is a potential complication of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), yet little data exist regarding its occurrence. This study examines the incidence, etiology, and outcome of this event.\nA prospective institutional database was used to identify cases of acute rAAD following TEVAR from a cohort of 309 consecutive procedures from March 2005 (date of initial Food and Drug Administration approval) to September 2010. The database was analyzed for the complication of rAAD as well as relevant patient and operative variables.\nThe incidence of rAAD was 1.9% (6/309); all cases occurred with proximal landing zone in the ascending aorta and/or arch (zones 0-2). All were identified in the perioperative period (range, 0-6 days) with 33% (2/6) 30-day/in-hospital mortality. Eighty-three percent (5/6) underwent emergent repair; one patient died without repair. rAAD patients were similar to the non-rAAD group (n = 303) across pertinent variables, including age, gender, race, and device size (all P > .1). rAAD incidence by aortic pathology was 1.0% (2/200) for aneurysm, 4.4% (4/91) for dissection, and 0% (0/18) for transection; P = .08. rAAD incidence by device was TAG (Gore) 1.0% (2/205), Talent (Medtronic) 4.7% (2/43), and Zenith TX2 (Cook) 3.6% (2/55). rAAD incidence was observed to be higher among patients with an ascending aortic diameter \u2265 4.0 cm (4.8% vs 0.9% for ascending diameter <4.0 cm); P = .047. Incidence was also higher with proximal landing zone in the native ascending aorta (zone 0) 6.9% (2/29) versus 1.4% for all others (4/280); P = .101. For patients with dissection pathology and an ascending aortic diameter \u2265 4.0 cm, 11% (3/28) suffered rAAD; with the combination of native ascending aorta (zone 0) landing zone measuring \u2265 4.0 cm, the incidence was 25% (2/8). Definitive diagnosis was by computed tomography angiography (n = 1), intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (n = 3), intraoperative arteriography (n = 1), or postmortem autopsy (n = 1).\nrAAD is a lethal early complication of TEVAR, which may be more common when treating dissection, with devices utilizing proximal bare springs or barbs for fixation, with native zone 0 proximal landing zone and with ascending aortic diameter \u2265 4 cm. Combinations of these risk factors may be particularly high risk. Intraoperative imaging assessment of the ascending aorta should be conducted following TEVAR to avoid under-recognition. National database reporting of this complication is needed to ensure safety and proper application of emerging TEVAR technology.",

    "abstract": "The long-term results of treating chronic aortic dissections and aneurysms in association with dissections with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) are unknown, and the timing for intervention is uncertain. We evaluated the morphology of stent graft and aorta remodeling and the volumetric changes in these patients after successful TEVAR.\nSerial computed tomography scans of 32 patients who underwent TEVAR for uncomplicated chronic dissections (group A, n = 17) and chronic dissections with aneurysms (group B, n = 15) were analyzed at 1, 6, 12, and 36 months. Stent graft diameter changes and positional migration were assessed three-dimensionally using Mimics 14.0 (Materialize, Leuven, Belgium). Volumetric data for true lumen, false lumen, thrombus load, and aortic size were measured by Aquarius iNtuition 4.4 software (TeraRecon, San Mateo, Calif). Results were compared between the two groups and with stent graft diameter, length, and oversizing.\nAortic stent grafts remodeled progressively, with inlet area increasing 4.4%, 10.1%, and 14.2% and outlet area increasing 42.6%, 67.2%, and 72.3%, respectively, at 6, 12, and 36 months. True lumen volume increased progressively in group A (114 to 174 mL) and group B (124 to 190 mL) from baseline to 36 months. False lumen volume decreased in group A (150 to 88 mL) and group B (351 to 250 mL), whereas thrombus load in the false lumen increased from 73% to 80% in group A and 84% to 87% in group B in 3 years. Eight patients (4 in each group) showed an increase in total aortic volume of >10%, 12 showed a static volume, and 12 showed shrinkage. Aortic volume change had no relationship to pathology, stent graft sizing, and thrombus load but was positively associated with the placement of a longer graft. A small but progressive distal migration of stent grafts was noted in all patients (3.1, 4.5, and 5.1 mm at 6, 12, and 36 months) but was more prominent in shorter stent grafts (\u2264 162 mm). No deaths, rupture, or secondary interventions occurred during follow-up.\nAortic remodeling after TEVAR in chronic dissection is a continuous process. There were no significant differences between chronic dissections and aneurysms in all volumetric parameters. Treating chronic dissections early, before aneurysm formation, did not appear to have a morphologic advantage.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the trend in inpatient vascular procedures in the United States over the past decade and predict the future demand for vascular surgeons.\nThe Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried to determine the weighted national estimates of inpatient vascular procedures performed on adult patients (age \u2265 18) between 1997 and 2008. Using population estimates from the United States Census Bureau, the per capita rates of inpatient procedures were calculated for age-specific groups (18-64 years, 65-84 years, and \u2265 85 years). The change in per capita rates over the past decade along with population forecasts were used to predict future workload.\nThere was a net increase of 22% from 971,046 inpatient vascular procedures for all adults in 1997 to 1,188,332 in 2008. During the same time period, the adult population increased by 16% from 198 to 230 million. The age-stratified per capita rates of all vascular procedures were +21% for age 18 to 64; -4% for age 65 to 84; and +18% for age \u2265 85. This resulted in a net increase of 5% (490 to 515 procedures per 100,000 capita) in the per capita rate for all adults. Based on the assumption that trends in age-specific rates remain constant, there is a predicted inpatient workload increase (compared to 2008) of 18% by 2015, 34% by 2020, and 72% by 2030. The vascular workload is predicted to more than double by the year 2040.\nDespite a conservative approach of using a population-based analysis of only inpatient procedures, there is a dramatic increase in the predicted vascular workload for the future. The vascular surgery training process will need to adapt to ensure an adequate number of fellowship-trained vascular surgeons is available to provide quality vascular care in the future.",

    "abstract": "Patients with juxtarenal, pararenal, or thoracoabdominal aneurysms require complex surgical open repair, which is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. The \"chimney graft\" or \"snorkel\" technique has evolved as a potential alternative to fenestrated and side-branched endografts. The purpose of this study is to review all published reports on chimney graft (CG) technique involving visceral vessels and investigate the safety and efficacy of the technique.\nStudies were included in the present review if visceral revascularization during endovascular treatment of aortic pathologies was achieved via a CG implantation. Reports on the chimney technique for aortic arch branches revascularization were excluded. A multiple electronic health database search was performed on all articles published until April 2011.\nThe electronic literature search yielded 15 reports that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A total of 93 patients (81.3% male; mean age, 71.9 \u00b1 0.9 years) were analyzed. In 77.4% of the patients, the CG procedure was applied for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Out of the 93 patients, 24.7% were operated on in an urgent setting (symptomatic or ruptured aneurysm). A total of 134 CGs were implanted: 108 to the renal arteries, 20 to the superior mesenteric artery, five to the celiac trunk, and one to the inferior mesenteric artery. In 57 patients, a single CG was deployed; in 32 patients, two CGs; in three patients, three CGs; and in one patient, four CGs were deployed. Ninety-four percent of CGs were directed proximally, whereas 6.0% were directed caudally. Primary technical success was achieved in all patients. A total of 13 patients (14.0%) developed a type I endoleak. Three were detected and treated intraoperatively. Postoperatively, 10 type I endoleaks were revealed, four of which required secondary intervention. During a mean follow-up period of 9.0 \u00b1 1.0 months, 131 of 134 (97.8%) CGs remained patent. Two CGs to the renal arteries and one to the superior mesenteric artery occluded. Postoperatively, 11.8% of patients suffered renal function impairment and 2.1% a myocardial infarction. Ischemic stroke presented in 3.2% of patients. The 30-day in-hospital mortality was 4.3%.\nThe role of the chimney technique in the management of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms is still unclear. This technique has relatively good results, considering the anatomic limitations of the aortic neck. However, long-term endograft durability and proximal fixation remains a significant concern. Thus, there is a reasonable hesitation to embrace the method for widespread use in the absence of long-term data.",

    "abstract": "Creating an experimental model of a type B aortic dissection with a minimally invasive endovascular procedure in swine to help future evaluation of therapies for aortic dissection.\nAortic dissection was created in 14 swine using endovascular procedures only. Under fluoroscopy, a modified 10F outer catheter with a 14 G stiffening inner metallic cannula was forced via the femoral artery into the aortic vessel wall to create an initial dissection. A .035-inch guidewire and a 4F straight catheter were advanced into the dissected space, and the dissection was extended in a retrograde direction using a technique including loop formation of the guidewire, which was placed carefully against the transmural penetration and extended as far as possible in the descending thoracic aorta up to the point where loop formation of the guidewire reached smoothly. An 8F introducer sheath was advanced with a Brockenbrough needle into the dissected space, and a proximal fenestration was created by puncturing the intima. If required, balloon dilatation was performed to enlarge the proximal and distal tears. Aortography and contrast-enhanced cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) were performed in addition to a detailed histologic evaluation of the dissected portion.\nAortic dissection was successfully created in 11 of the 14 swine (78.6%). Among the 11 dissections, nine were located in the thoracoabdominal aorta and two in the abdominal aorta. The initial aortic diameter at the middle portion of the created dissection ranged from 7.4 to 16.8 mm (mean \u00b1 standard deviation, 10.9 \u00b1 2.9), while after dissection, it ranged from 7.8 to 19.3 mm (12.9 \u00b1 3.8 mm). The dissected length ranged from 4.4 to 17.7 cm (10.7 \u00b1 4.6 cm). Aortography and CBCT revealed seven dissections (63.6%) with a smooth and patent false lumen. Histologic evaluation revealed that the outer one-third of the media was separated from the inner two-thirds. In the remaining four dissections (36.4%), imaging procedures revealed the formation of a rough and patent false lumen beside the true lumen, and histologic evaluation revealed greater separation of the outer media. Five animals were chronic dissection models. Three (60%) of these survived for more than 14 days without any symptoms. Moreover, completely patent true and false lumens without thrombus formation were observed in these three animals. The aortic diameter at the dissected portion tended to be dilated compared with the initial diameter.\nThis new technique of creating an experimental aortic dissection model in swine is promising and should contribute to the development of future therapies for aortic dissection.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that biologic changes in the vein wall associated with varicose veins (VVs) occur not only in valvular tissue but also in nonvalvular regions. We previously used imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) to determine the distribution of lipid molecules in incompetent valve tissue. In this study, we used IMS to analyze incompetent great saphenous veins (GSVs) in patients with varicose vein (VV) to assess the distribution of lipid molecules.\nWe obtained GSV tissue from 38 VV patients (50 limbs) who underwent GSV stripping. For the control veins (CV), we obtained GSV samples from 10 patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass with reversed GSV grafting for peripheral artery occlusive disease (10 limbs). Conventional and immunofluorescence staining were performed for histopathologic examination. The total lipid content in the homogenized vein tissue was determined. The localization of each lipid molecule in the vein wall was assessed by IMS.\nThe histologic examination showed the VV walls were significantly thicker than the CV walls, and only the VV adventitia was positive for lipid staining. The VV wall had higher concentrations of phospholipids and triglycerides than the CV wall. IMS revealed an abnormal accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC; 1-acyl 16:0) and phosphatidylcholine (diacyl 16:0/20:4) in the VV intima and media. Triglyceride was found only in VV adventitia. The number of lymphatic vessels, as measured by staining with D2-40, a lymphatic vessel-specific marker, was significantly lower in the VV adventitia than in the CV adventitia. Lymphatic vessel reduction may be associated with insufficient lymphatic drainage in the VV adventitia causing histologic changes in VV tissue.\nThe accumulation of LPC (1-acyl 16:0) and PC (diacyl 16:0/20:4) in the VV intima and media may be associated with chronic inflammation, leading to VV tissue degeneration. Furthermore, insufficient lipid drainage by lymphatic vessel may be responsible for accumulation of lipid molecules and subsequent vein wall degeneration.",

The VV wall had higher concentrations of phospholipids and triglycerides than the CV wall. IMS revealed an abnormal accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC; 1-acyl 16:0) and phosphatidylcholine (diacyl 16:0/20:4) in the VV intima and media. Triglyceride was found only in VV adventitia. The number of lymphatic vessels, as measured by staining with D2-40, a lymphatic vessel-specific marker, was significantly lower in the VV adventitia than in the CV adventitia. Lymphatic vessel reduction may be associated with insufficient lymphatic drainage in the VV adventitia causing histologic changes in VV tissue.",

    "abstract": "Internal iliac artery (IIA) embolization is performed in a variety of clinical scenarios, most commonly in patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with an iliac artery aneurysm or inadequate distal landing zone. In these patients, IIA embolization with iliac limb extension is often performed. While IIA embolization can be routinely performed with either ipsilateral or contralateral femoral arterial access, it can be challenging in some patients with an acutely angulated aortic or iliac bifurcation and in patients with short or ectatic common iliac arteries. In this select group of patients with difficult anatomy, IIA embolization can be challenging and may lead to increased radiation exposure and contrast administration. Having a sheath precisely positioned and stabilized at the internal iliac artery origin will facilitate embolization of the IIA. This report describes a novel technique in which crossover femoral-femoral artery buddy wire placement achieves stable positioning of large sheaths for concurrent IIA embolization at the time of EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Usually, physicians base their practice on guidelines, but recommendations on the same topic may vary across guidelines. Given the uncertainties regarding abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening, physicians should be able to identify systematically and transparently developed recommendations. We performed a systematic review of AAA screening guidelines to assist physicians in their choice of recommendations.\nGuidelines in English published between January 1, 2003 and February 26, 2010 were retrieved using MEDLINE, CINAHL, the National Guideline Clearinghouse, the National Library for Health, the Canadian Medication Association Infobase, and the G-I-N International Guideline Library. Guidelines developed by national and international medical societies from Western countries, containing recommendations on AAA screening were included. Three reviewers independently assessed rigor of guideline development using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument. Two independent reviewers performed extraction of recommendations.\nOf 2415 titles identified, seven guidelines were included in this review. Three guidelines were less rigorously developed based on AGREE scores below 40%. All seven guidelines contained a recommendation for one-time screening of elderly men by ultrasonography to select AAAs \u2265 5.5 cm for elective surgical repair. Four guidelines, of which three were less rigorously developed, contained disparate recommendations on screening of women and middle-aged men at elevated risk. There was no agreement on the management of smaller AAAs.\nConsensus exists across guidelines on one-time screening of elderly men to detect and treat AAAs \u2265 5.5 cm. For other target groups and management of small AAAs, prediction models and cost-effectiveness analyses are needed to provide guidance.",

    "abstract": "Iatrogenic arterial injury is an uncommon but recognized complication of posterior spinal surgery. The spectrum of injuries includes vessel perforation leading to hemorrhage, delayed pseudoaneurysm formation, and threatened perforation by screw impingement on arterial vessels. Repair of these injuries traditionally involved open direct vessel repair or graft placement, which can be associated with significant morbidity. We identified five patients with iatrogenic arterial injury during or after posterior spinal surgery between July 2004 and August 2009 and describe their endovascular treatment. Intraoperative arterial bleeding was encountered in two patients during posterior spinal surgery. The posterior wounds were packed, temporarily closed, and the patient was placed supine. In both patients, angiography demonstrated arterial injury necessitating repair. Covered stent grafts were deployed through femoral cutdowns to exclude the areas of injury. In three additional patients, postoperative computed tomography imaging demonstrated pedicle screws abutting/penetrating the thoracic or abdominal aorta. Angiography or intravascular ultrasound imaging, or both, confirmed indention/perforation of the aorta by the screw. Aortic stent graft cuffs were deployed through femoral cutdowns to cover the area of aortic contact before hardware removal. All five patients did well and were discharged home in good condition. Endovascular repair of arterial injuries occurring during posterior spinal procedures is feasible and can offer a safe and less invasive alternative to open repair.",

    "abstract": "The escalating cost burden of hospital readmission has prompted recent nationwide efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of this important quality measure. Because patients undergoing vascular surgery account for a significant proportion of readmissions, vascular surgeons may face reduced reimbursements in the near future if these trends continue. However, risk factors associated with readmission remain poorly defined, and further research is needed to identify interventions that will prevent readmission following vascular procedures. Accordingly, this manuscript will (1) propose a conceptual model to explain the driving forces behind readmissions in vascular surgery, (2) review current evidence directed at identifying risk factors and evaluating interventions to reduce readmissions across different medical and surgical specialties, and (3) identify key areas in patient care where targeted research or interventions may be implemented in vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous treatment of multilevel aortic disease is controversial due to the theoretic increase in morbidity. This study was conducted to define the outcomes in patients treated electively with simultaneous thoracic endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (TEVAR) and abdominal aortic endovascular endografting for synchronous aortic pathology.\nPatients treated with simultaneous TEVAR and endovascular aneurysm repair (T&E) at the University of Florida were identified from a prospectively maintained endovascular aortic registry and compared with those treated with TEVAR alone (TA). The study excluded patients with urgent or emergency indications, thoracoabdominal or mycotic aneurysm, and those requiring chimney stents, fenestrations, or visceral debranching procedures. Demographics, anatomic characteristics, operative details, and periprocedural morbidity were recorded. Mortality and reintervention were estimated using life-table analysis.\nFrom 2001 to 2011, 595 patients underwent TEVAR, of whom 457 had elective repair. Twenty-two (18 men, 82%) were identified who were treated electively with simultaneous T&E. Mean \u00b1 standard deviation age was 66 \u00b1 9 years, and median follow-up was 8.8 months (range, 1-34 months). Operative indications for the procedure included dissection-related pathology in 10 (45%) and various combinations of degenerative etiologies in 12 (55%). Compared with TA, T&E patients had significantly higher blood loss (P < .0001), contrast exposure (P < .0001), fluoroscopy time (P < .0001), and operative time (P < .0001). The temporary spinal cord ischemia rate was 13.6% (n = 3) for the T&E group and 6.0% for TA (P = .15); however, the permanent spinal cord ischemia rate was 4% for both groups (P = .96). The 30-day mortality for T&E was 4.5% (n = 1) compared with 2.1% (n = 10) for TA. Temporary renal injury (defined by a 25% increase over baseline creatinine) occurred in two T&E patients (9.1%), with none requiring permanent hemodialysis; no significant difference was noted between the two groups (P = .14). One-year mortality and freedom from reintervention in the T&E patients were 81% and 91%, respectively.\nAcceptable short-term morbidity and mortality can be achieved with T&E compared with TA, despite longer operative times, greater blood loss, and higher contrast exposure. There was a trend toward higher rates of renal and spinal cord injury, so implementation of strategies to reduce the potential of these complications or consideration of staged repair is recommended. Short-term reintervention rates are low, but longer follow-up and greater patient numbers are needed to determine procedural durability and applicability.",

    "abstract": "Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a syndrome associated with chronic abdominal pain and radiographic evidence of celiac artery compression. We compared the evidence for both open and laparoscopic treatment of patients with MALS.\nWe reviewed the English-language literature between 1963 and 2012. Presenting symptoms, clinical improvement, operative details, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were noted.\nA total of 400 patients underwent surgical (open and laparoscopic) treatment for MALS. Three hundred thirty-nine patients reported immediate postoperative symptom relief (85%). Late recurrence of symptoms was reported in 19 patients in the open group (6.8%) and seven patients in the laparoscopic group (5.7%). Eleven out of 121 patients (9.1%) in the laparoscopic group required open conversion secondary to bleeding.\nThe available evidence demonstrates that both laparoscopic and open ligament release, celiac ganglionectomy, and celiac artery revascularization may provide sustained symptom relief in the majority of patients diagnosed with MALS. The role of arterial revascularization following ligament release remains unclear. The rate of open conversion with the laparoscopic approach is high, but no perioperative deaths have been reported.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a technically demanding procedure with a risk of periprocedural stroke. A scoring system based on anatomic criteria has been developed to facilitate patient selection for CAS. Advancements in simulation science also enable case evaluation through patient-specific virtual reality (VR) rehearsal on an endovascular simulator. This study aimed to validate the anatomic scoring system for CAS using the patient-specific VR technology.\nThree patients were selected and graded according to the CAS scoring system (maximum score, 9): one easy (score, <4.9), one intermediate (score, 5.0-5.9), and one difficult (score, >7.0). The three cases were performed on the simulator in random order by 20 novice interventionalists pretrained in CAS. Technical performances were assessed using simulator-based metrics and expert-based ratings.\nThe interventionalists took significantly longer to perform the difficult CAS case (median, 31.6 vs 19.7 vs 14.6 minutes; P<.0001) compared with the intermediate and easy cases; similarly, more fluoroscopy time (20.7 vs 12.1 vs 8.2 minutes; P<.0001), contrast volume (56.5 vs 51.5 vs 50.0 mL; P=.0060), and roadmaps (10 vs 9 vs 9; P=.0040) were used. The quality of performance declined significantly as the cases became more challenging (score, 24 vs 22 vs 19; P<.0001).\nThe anatomic scoring system for CAS can predict the difficulty of a CAS procedure as measured by patient-specific VR. This scoring system, with or without the additional use of patient-specific VR, can guide novice interventionalists in selecting appropriate patients for CAS. This may reduce the perioperative stroke risk and enhance patient safety.",

The technique involved bifurcated main body placement followed by simultaneous deployment of parallel endograft limbs into the external iliac (ipsilateral approach) and hypogastric (contralateral femoral or brachial approach) arteries. Bilateral hypogastric branches were performed in two patients, and unilateral branches with and without contralateral coil embolization were performed in nine and ten patients, respectively. Procedural success rate was 96%, technical success rate (successful implantation with immediate aneurysm exclusion and no observed endoleak) was 88%, and access was fully-percutaneous in 86%. Two type III endoleaks between branch components were noted on completion angiograms, but both resolved spontaneously on follow-up imaging. One type Ib endoleak was noted on postoperative imaging (contralateral to hypogastric branch, repaired with limb extension), as were three type II endoleaks (14%) without sac expansion. Early (<2 weeks) limb occlusion (one external iliac, two hypogastric) occurred in two patients, though no subsequent occlusions have occurred (mean follow-up, 7.2 months; range, 1-20 months). Primary patency for external iliac and hypogastric limbs at 6 months was 95% and 88%, respectively. There were no deaths; complications included groin hematoma in 10% and acute renal insufficiency in 5%. Buttock claudication (n = 4) only occurred in patients who had ipsilateral coil embolization of hypogastric arteries (n = 9) for bilateral iliac aneurysms in which only unilateral hypogastric preservation was performed, resulting in rate of 44% in these patients.\nThe double-barrel technique for hypogastric preservation is technically feasible across multiple interventionalists using commercially available endografts without device modification. These procedures are associated with minimal morbidity, acceptable short-term limb-patency rates, and reduced buttock claudication compared with those involving contralateral hypogastric embolization.",

Toe pressures were determined in the horizontal position only. In addition, 13 patients were examined before and, on average, 3 days after revascularization.\nMedian SO(2) was 62% (25%-75% percentile: 37%-75%) with the limb in the horizontal position and 16% (3%-41%) with the limb elevated. Comparing the individual toe pressures with SO(2) values measured in the horizontal position and elevated position revealed a significant correlation (r(s) = 0.40; P < .01 and r(s) = 0.56; P < .01, respectively). A low SO(2) (ie, <40% in the horizontal position and <20% in the elevated position) was highly predictive of a toe pressure of 40 mm Hg or less. In the horizontal position, the positive predictive value was 100%, whereas the negative predictive value was 47%. The similar figures in the elevated position were a positive predictive value of 97% and a negative predictive value of 68%. Postoperatively, SO(2) increased significantly from 27% (P25%-75%: 11%-75%) to 79% (68%-87%) in the horizontal position (P = .008) and from 14% (P25%-75%: 2%-39%) to 55% (30%-73%) in the elevated position (P = .011), respectively. Looking at the individual 13 cases in which revascularization was performed, three patients had a partial reconstruction (ie, superficial femoral artery occlusion distal to a central reconstruction or reconstruction to a popliteal blind segment). These patients had significantly lower postoperative SO(2) as well as toe pressure compared with the 10 patients with unobstructed flow to the foot.\nO2C was easy to use, fast, and painless. The most useful finding was the high predictive value of a low saturation and the rise in O2C values after successful revascularization.",

    "abstract": "Although the association of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is known, the exact magnitude of the association has not been described. Our goal was to quantify the incidence of TAA in patients with an AAA and assess predictive factors for its diagnosis.\nThis was a retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with AAA from 2000-2008. The subsequent development or diagnosis of a TAA was noted and the association between AAA and TAA described.\nA total of 2196 patients with an AAA were reviewed. 1082 (49.3%) had a chest computed tomography (CT) during follow-up. 117 patients (10.8%) had a synchronous and 136 (12.6%) a metachronous TAA. Mean time to diagnosis was 2.3 years. Mean diameter was 4.7 \u00b1 1.4 cm for AAA, and 4.7 \u00b1 1.0 for TAA. Indications for the chest CT were variable. Most common were AAA (15%), pulmonary embolus (14%), and lung cancer (11%). Only 38% of AAAs and 14% of TAAs were repaired during the study period. Of all patients with known AAA who were found to have a TAA, 61/253 (24%) underwent repair, had a rupture, or had a TAA >5.5 cm. At a mean follow-up of 43.6 months, there were 79 deaths (7%): 7 AAA-related and 13 from TAA ruptures. Predictors of TAA diagnosis by logistic regression include African American race (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8; P = .02), family history of TAA (OR = 7.6; P = .04), hypertension (OR = 1.7; P = .006), and obesity (OR = 1.7; P = .006). Diabetes, infrarenal AAA location, and smoking have a negative association.\nTAAs are relatively common in patients with AAA. Routine or targeted screening with a chest CT at the time of AAA diagnosis may be indicated.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the pathogenesis of arteriovenous (AV) fistula failure in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and tests the vascular protective effect of rosuvastatin on the fistulous communication of diabetic rats.\nDM was induced in rats by a single injection of streptozotocin. One week later, a fistula was created in the descending aorta and the adjacent inferior vena cava (aortocaval [AC] fistula). Rats were then randomly assigned to receive placebo or rosuvastatin (15 mg/kg/d) in chow for 2 weeks. Blood flow in the aortic segments of the fistula was measured. Circulating CD34+/KDR+ endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were determined 2 weeks after creation of the AC fistulas using flow cytometry. Vascular function of the AC fistulas was assessed by isometric force testing. The expression of proinflammatory genes and generation of superoxide anions in the fistulas were examined.\nThe number of EPCs was reduced in diabetic rats, and rosuvastatin significantly increased the number of circulating EPCs. Reduced blood flow and impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation in the AC fistula of animals with diabetes was significantly potentiated after treatment with rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin also attenuated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase and generation of superoxide anions in the fistula tissues isolated from diabetic rats.\nWe provide the first evidence demonstrating that rosuvastatin improves blood flow and endothelial function of AC fistulas in rats with DM by attenuating the activity of proinflammatory genes and generation of superoxide anions in the remodeled vasculature.\nArteriovenous (AV) fistula is the most common vascular access for hemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease. Studies have shown that blood flow in the AV fistula is significantly reduced in patients with diabetes and the period for maturation of an AV fistula is longer in these patients. The underlying mechanisms of AV fistula failure in diabetes are still poorly understood and there are limited therapeutic approaches that can increase the lifespan of these fistulas. The present study demonstrates that oral administration rosuvastatin improves blood flow and endothelial function of AC fistulas in rats with diabetes, which results from attenuating the activity of proinflammatory genes in the remodeled vasculature, thereby reducing the generation of tissue superoxide anions. Our results may thus enhance our ability to prevent and manage vascular access failure in patients with diabetes with chronic renal disease.",

    "abstract": "Blunt injury to the descending thoracic aorta is a potentially life-threatening condition necessitating rapid assessment and possible surgical intervention. The purpose of this study was to review outcomes of patients who sustained blunt thoracic aortic injury at a single institution.\nOur institutional Trauma Registry Database was searched for patients who sustained acute blunt descending thoracic aortic injury between July 1990 and July 2010. Individual injuries, anatomic and physiological measures of injury severity, and operative and hospital mortality were compared between patients undergoing open surgical and thoracic endovascular aortic repair. Additionally, aortic injury grade, management, and outcomes were reviewed for patients who did not undergo an aortic intervention.\nOf the 100 patients identified over the 20-year study period, 60 (60%) underwent conventional open repair, 26 (26%) underwent endovascular repair, and 14 (14%) did not undergo an aortic intervention. The overall hospital mortality rate for the entire patient cohort was 34%. Of the 14 patients who did not undergo an aortic intervention, five (36%) were successfully medically managed and four (80%) of these had grade I aortic injuries. One of the successfully medically managed patients required endovascular repair 9 months after injury. Four medically managed patients expired as a result of aortic rupture within 1 to 2.5 hours of presentation. Two expired immediately after diagnosis, and the other two could have potentially been treated with improvements in transfer and diagnosis times. Age, individual injuries, and measures of injury severity were similar between patients undergoing open surgical or endovascular repair. Patients who underwent endovascular repair experienced a significantly lower intraoperative (0% vs 18%; P < .05) and overall hospital mortality (12% vs 37%; P < .05). Additionally, endovascular repair was associated with reductions in operative time, estimated blood loss, and intraoperative blood transfusions. Five endovascular patients required secondary interventions to treat endograft-related complications, including malapposition to the aortic arch (n = 3), midendograft stenosis (n = 1), and left upper extremity ischemia (n = 1).\nBlunt thoracic aortic injury to the descending thoracic aorta is associated with a high overall hospital mortality. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair is associated with significantly lower operative times, procedural blood loss, intraoperative blood transfusion, as well as intraoperative and overall hospital mortality compared with conventional open surgical repair. Consideration of this form of therapy as the initial form of treatment is warranted in anatomically acceptable candidates.",

    "abstract": "This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of the mode of anesthesia and outcome after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nReview methods were according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Published and unpublished literature was searched. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were categorized for patient selection, perioperative outcomes, and postoperative outcomes. Weighted mean differences (WMD) were calculated for continuous variables, such as length of stay, and pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for discrete variables such as major morbidity.\nTen studies of 13,459 patients given local anesthesia (LA) or general anesthesia (GA) were eligible for analysis. There was no difference in 30-day mortality. The LA patients were older than the GA patients (WMD, 0.17; P = .006), with an increased burden of cardiac (LA vs GA: OR, 1.28; P = .011) and respiratory (LA vs GA: OR, 1.28; P = .006) comorbidity. LA EVAR was reported with shorter operative time (WMD, -0.54; P = .001) and hospital stay (WMD, -0.27; P = .001) vs GA. LA patients developed fewer postoperative complications than GA patients (OR, 0.54; P < .001).\nThe absence of randomized data is a major hurdle to understanding the effect of anesthetic technique on morbidity after EVAR. The data presented are encouraging in selected patients. The use of locoregional anesthesia for EVAR should be further investigated with better reporting of aneurysm morphology to clarify its potential benefits and identify the subgroups that will derive greatest benefit.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed neurovascular complications in the surgical management of carotid body tumors (CBTs), with emphasis on those treated with and without preoperative embolization.\nWe reviewed the clinical data of all consecutive patients with CBTs treated by surgical resection at our institution from 1985 to 2010. Outcomes were compared between Shamblin class II and III CBTs treated with preoperative embolization (EMB group) and with no preoperative embolization (NEMB group).\nA total of 131 patients (80 women, 51 men), who were aged 48 years (range, 16-84 years), had resection of 144 CBTs and 12 concurrent cervical paragangliomas. This included 18 patients who had bilateral resections and 29 with familial CBTs. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDHx) mutations were confirmed in 17 patients. Mean tumor volume was 20.5 cm(3) (range, 0.8-101.3 cm(3)), and there were two biochemically active CBTs (1%). There were 71 Shamblin II and 33 Shamblin III. The EMB group underwent 33 CBT resections, and the NEMB group underwent 71. There were more patients in the EMB group with bilateral (48% vs 22%; P = .01) and familial (34% vs 14%; P = .01) CBT; otherwise, patient demographics, Shamblin class, and tumor diameter and volumes were similar. No strokes or other major complications occurred after preoperative embolization with polyvinyl alcohol particles 1 day before surgery. The EMB group required less extensive procedures (simple excision in 97% vs 82%, P = .03; internal carotid artery clamping in 15% vs 37%, P = .04) and had less blood loss (mean estimated blood loss, 263 vs 599 mL; P = .002) than the NEMB group. However, there were no significant differences in operative time (250 vs 265 minutes; P = .49), temporary cranial nerve injury (52% vs 38%; P = .21), clinically apparent cranial nerve deficits after 1 year (12% vs 7%; P = .46), deaths (0% vs 0%; P > .99), stroke (0% vs 1%; P > .99), or postoperative length of stay (4.1 vs 4.2 days; P = .91).\nLarge CBTs can be resected safely with or without preoperative embolization. Preoperative embolization may simplify the conduct of the operation and reduce blood loss but does not decrease rates of cranial nerve injury, although most are temporary.",

    "abstract": "To compare the safety and efficacy of coil embolization (COIL) to Amplatzer vascular plug embolization (PLUG) to achieve internal iliac artery (IIA) occlusion prior to endovascular aortiliac aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nData from consecutive patients who underwent IIA embolization prior to EVAR over a 6-year period (2004-2010) were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, treatment modalities, and outcomes were compared.\nFrom January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2010, a total of 53 patients underwent percutaneous embolization of 57 IIAs prior to EVAR. Twenty-nine IIAs underwent COIL and 28 IIAs underwent PLUG embolization. Patient demographics and risk factors were similar between the two groups. Patients underwent repair for aneurysmal dilation of the infrarenal aorta in conjunction with the common or internal iliac arteries (n = 35, 62%) or isolated iliac artery aneurysms (n = 19, 38%). A significantly greater number of embolization devices were used in the COIL group (5.8 \u00b1 3.8 vs 1.1 \u00b1 0.4; P < .0001). Patients undergoing PLUG embolization demonstrated significantly shorter procedure times (118.4 \u00b1 64.7 minutes vs 72.6 \u00b1 22.4 minutes; P = .008) and fluoroscopy times (32.6 \u00b1 14.6 vs 14.4 \u00b1 8.6 minutes; P = .002). However, radiation dose between the groups did not differ (COIL: 470,192.7 \u00b1 190,606.6 vs PLUG: 300,972.2 \u00b1 191,815.7 mGycm(2); P = .10). Overall periprocedural morbidity did not differ between the groups (COIL: 11% vs PLUG: 6%; P = 1.0), and there were no perioperative mortalities or severe complications. Nontarget embolization occurred in two COIL and no PLUG cases (COIL: 6.9% vs PLUG: 0%; P = .49). Patient-reported buttock claudication at 1 month was 17.2% for COIL and 39.3% for PLUG patients (P = .08). At last follow-up, persistent buttock claudication was reported in 13.8% of COIL and in 14.3% of PLUG embolizations (P = 1.0). There was no significant difference in charges for the embolization material, operating room, or overall hospital charges (COIL: 44,720 \u00b1 19,153 vs 37,367 \u00b1 10,915; P = .22). Lastly, zero endoleaks in the COIL group and three in the PLUG group (P = .40) were detected on the most recent follow-up computed tomography imaging. No endoleak was related to the site of IIA embolization.\nCOIL and PLUG embolization both provide effective IIA embolization with low complication rates when used for EVAR. Buttock claudication did occur in approximately one-third of patients but resolved in half of those affected. PLUG embolization took significantly less time to perform and required decreased fluoroscopy times. Based on outcomes and cost-analysis, COIL and PLUG embolization are equivalent methods to achieve IIA occlusion during EVAR.",

    "abstract": "This study presents the short-term and midterm results of direct percutaneous sac injection (DPSI) for postoperative endoleak treatment after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nBetween March 1994 and November 2011, EVAR was performed in 986 patients. The median follow-up was 63 \u00b1 45 months (range, 0-211 months). A retrospective analysis was performed. DPSI was used in 21 patients for 19 type II endoleaks and two endoleaks of undefined origin (EOUO), of which 12 (57%) were after failure of a previous endovascular treatment attempt.\nDPSI using thrombin (n = 16), coils (n = 7), gelfoam (n = 6), or glue (n = 3), or a combination, was technically feasible in all patients. Saccography during DPSI revealed a previously undetected type I endoleak in three patients. Immediate DPSI success was achieved in 16 of 18 procedures (88.9%), with two complications. Glue incidentally intravasated in the inferior vena cava, causing a clinically nonsignificant subsegmental pulmonary artery embolism in one patient, and the temporary development of a type III endoleak, possibly from graft puncture, in another. During a median follow-up of 39 months (interquartile range, 13-88 months) after DPSI, recurrent endoleaks were observed in nine patients (50.0%), one type I endoleak due to graft migration, five type II endoleaks, and three EOUO. The occurrence of a re-endoleak during follow-up was significantly associated with dual-antiplatelet medication (0% in patients without re-endoleak vs 44.4% in patients with re-endoleak; P = .023) and with a nonsignificant trend for the use of aspirin alone (33.3% in patients without re-endoleak vs 80% in patients with re-endoleak; P = .094). Re-endoleak occurred in 33.3% of the patients without antiplatelet medication and in 100% of patients with dual-antiplatelet medication (P = .026). Thrombin was used as the sole embolic agent during the initial DPSI in all patients with dual-antiplatelet therapy. No other factor was significantly associated with re-endoleaks. Reintervention was deemed necessary in six patients within a median of 10 months (interquartile range, 4-16 months) after DPSI, including six additional DPSI treatments in four patients with type II re-endoleaks, cuff placements in one type I endoleak, and endograft relining in one EOUO.\nThis initial experience suggests that DPSI is feasible as a technique for endoleak treatment after EVAR. However, complications and endoleak recurrence remain a concern. The role of antiplatelet therapy and different embolic agents on long-term embolization success needs to be studied in more detail.",

Our case expands on these earlier reports that direct thrombolysis can be safely performed using local, intraclot infusions for portal vein thrombosis, and thrombolytic doses can be kept relatively low, limiting the risk of bleeding complications.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a frequent form of atherothrombotic disease, whose natural history is to enlarge and rupture. Indicators other than AAA diameter would be useful for preventive surgery decision-making, including positron-emission tomography (PET) methods permitting visualization of aortic wall leukocyte activation relevant to prognostic AAA evaluation. In this study, we compare three PET tracers of activated leukocytes, 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG), 18F-fluoro-methyl-choline (FCH), and 18F-DPA714 (a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) for in vivo PET quantification of aortic wall inflammation in rat experimental AAAs, in correlation with histopathological studies of lesions.\nAAAs were induced by orthotopic implantation of decellularized guinea pig abdominal aorta in 46 Lewis rats. FDG-PET (n = 20), FCH-PET (n = 8), or both (n = 12) were performed 2 weeks to 4 months after the graft, 1 hour after tracer injection (30 MBq). Six rats (one of which had FDG-PET) underwent 18F-DPA714-PET. Rats were sacrificed after imaging; AAAs and normal thoracic aortas were cut into axial sections for quantitative autoradiography and histologic studies, including ED1 (macrophages) and CD8 T lymphocyte immunostaining. Ex vivo staining of AAAs and thoracic aortas with 18F-DPA714 and unlabeled competitors was performed.\nAAAs developed in 35 out of 46 cases. FCH uptake in AAAs was lower than that of FDG in all cases on imaging, with lower AAA-to-background maximal standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) ratios (1.78 \u00b1 0.40 vs 2.71 \u00b1 0.54; P < .01 for SUV(max) ratios), and lower AAA-to-normal aorta activity ratios on autoradiography (3.52 \u00b1 1.26 vs 8.55 \u00b1 4.23; P < .005). FDG AAA-to-background SUV(max) ratios correlated with the intensity of CD8 + ED1 staining (r = .76; P < .03). FCH AAA-to-background SUV(max) ratios correlated with the intensity of ED1 staining (r = .80; P < .03). 18F-DPA714 uptake was similar in AAAs and in normal aortas, both in vivo and ex vivo.\nIn rat experimental AAA, characterized by an important aortic wall leukocytes activity, FDG-PET showed higher sensitivity than FCH-PET and 18F-DPA714-PET to detect activated leukocytes. This enhances potential interest of this tracer for prognostic evaluation of AAA in patients.",

    "abstract": "We describe a case of a type IIIb endoleak arising from the main body of a Talent endograft that was treated using two telescoping cuffs and two parallel upside-down inserted Excluder contralateral legs, thereby creating a new bifurcating endograft. First, a 23-mm cuff was deployed onto the flow divider of the Talent endograft, followed by a second 28-mm cuff below the renal arteries creating a tapering lumen. Two 20-mm Excluder contralateral limbs were then positioned upside-down in the 23-mm cuff and deployed simultaneously, creating a new bifurcated prosthesis. Control computed tomography (CT) scan at 6 weeks showed a good position of the endografts without signs of an endoleak. In conclusion, a type IIIb endoleak at the level of the flow divider may successfully be excluded using two telescoping cuffs and two parallel upside-down contralateral Excluder limbs. Due to the rarity of this complication, the treatment will always have to be tailor-made.",

    "abstract": "Long-term follow-up after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is very scarce, and doubt remains regarding the durability of these procedures. We designed a retrospective cohort study to assess long-term clinical outcome and morphologic changes in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) treated by EVAR using the Excluder endoprosthesis (W. L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz).\nFrom 2000 to 2007, 179 patients underwent EVAR in a tertiary institution. Clinical data were retrieved from a prospective database. All patients treated with the Excluder endoprosthesis were included. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans were retrospectively analyzed preoperatively, at 30 days, and at the last follow-up using dedicated tridimensional reconstruction software. For patients with complications, all remaining CTAs were also analyzed. The primary end point was clinical success. Secondary end points were freedom from reintervention, sac growth, types I and III endoleak, migration, conversion to open repair, and AAA-related death or rupture. Neck dilatation, renal function, and overall survival were also analyzed.\nIncluded were 144 patients (88.2% men; mean age, 71.6 years). Aneurysms were ruptured in 4.9%. American Society of Anesthesiologists classification was III/IV in 61.8%. No patients were lost during a median follow-up of 5.0 years (interquartile range, 3.1-6.4; maximum, 11.2 years). Two patients died of medical complications \u2264 30 days after EVAR. The estimated primary clinical success rates at 5 and 10 years were 63.5% and 41.1%, and secondary clinical success rates were 78.3% and 58.3%, respectively. Sac growth was observed in 37 of 142 patients (26.1%). Cox regression showed type I endoleak during follow-up (hazard ratio, 3.74; P = .008), original design model (hazard ratio, 3.85; P = .001), and preoperative neck diameter (1.27 per mm increase, P = .006) were determinants of sac growth. Secondary interventions were required in 32 patients (22.5%). The estimated 10-year rate of AAA-related death or rupture was 2.1%. Overall life expectancy after AAA repair was 6.8 years.\nEVAR using the Excluder endoprosthesis provides a safe and lasting treatment for AAA, despite the need for maintained surveillance and secondary interventions. At up to 11 years, the risk of AAA-related death or postimplantation rupture is remarkably low. The incidences of postimplantation sac growth and secondary intervention were greatly reduced after the introduction of the low-permeability design in 2004.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms (IAAAs) have been traditionally managed with open repair. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was approved September of 1999. Some authors have suggested that EVAR is not an acceptable option for management of an IAAA. However, several recent reports have suggested EVAR is a reasonable management option in these patients. The purpose of our study was to review our experience with the contemporary management of IAAA involving both open and endovascular approaches.\nA retrospective review of all patients undergoing repair of IAAAs from 1999 to 2011 was conducted at three geographically separate institutions. Basic demographics, diagnostic workup, treatment, and outcomes were reviewed.\nBetween 1999 and 2011, 69 patients underwent surgical repair of IAAAs, 59 by open repair and 10 by EVAR. Eighty-three percent of patients were men with a mean age of 67. Aneurysm size was similar in both groups (6.3 cm open repair vs 5.9 cm EVAR). Follow-up for the open group was a mean of 42.6 months and 33.6 months for the EVAR group. Periaortic fibrosis decreased from a mean of 5.4 mm to 2.7 mm after EVAR. Hydronephrosis was present preoperatively in one patient and did not change after EVAR. Aneurysm size decreased in seven patients (70%) who underwent EVAR. Two patients had no change with one lost to follow-up. Mean aneurysm size decrease after EVAR was 1.12 cm (17.8%). There were no aneurysm-related deaths or major morbidities in the EVAR group. Twenty-two patients (37%) in the open surgical group suffered major complications, including myocardial infarction, renal failure, lower extremity amputation, sepsis, and prolonged ventilation.\nEndovascular repair for IAAA results in successful management with improvement of periaortic inflammation. EVAR should be considered as first-line therapy in which anatomic parameters are favorable.",

Aneurysm size was similar in both groups (6.3 cm open repair vs 5.9 cm EVAR). Follow-up for the open group was a mean of 42.6 months and 33.6 months for the EVAR group. Periaortic fibrosis decreased from a mean of 5.4 mm to 2.7 mm after EVAR. Hydronephrosis was present preoperatively in one patient and did not change after EVAR. Aneurysm size decreased in seven patients (70%) who underwent EVAR. Two patients had no change with one lost to follow-up. Mean aneurysm size decrease after EVAR was 1.12 cm (17.8%). There were no aneurysm-related deaths or major morbidities in the EVAR group. Twenty-two patients (37%) in the open surgical group suffered major complications, including myocardial infarction, renal failure, lower extremity amputation, sepsis, and prolonged ventilation.",

    "abstract": "The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), in partnership with key specialty and subspecialty societies, conducted a review of common clinical scenarios where noninvasive vascular testing (ultrasound and physiological testing) is frequently considered. The indications (clinical scenarios) were derived from common applications or anticipated uses, as well as from current clinical practice guidelines and results of studies examining the implementation of the original appropriate use criteria (AUC). The 159 indications in this document were developed by a diverse writing group and scored by a separate independent technical panel on a scale of 1 to 9, to designate appropriate use (median 7 to 9), uncertain use (median 4 to 6), and inappropriate use (median 1 to 3). A total of 255 indications (with the inclusion of surveillance timeframes) were rated. One hundred and seventeen indications were rated as appropriate, 84 were rated as uncertain, and 54 were rated as inappropriate. The AUC for peripheral vascular disease have the potential to impact physician decision making, healthcare delivery, and reimbursement policy. Furthermore, recognition of uncertain clinical scenarios facilitates identification of areas that would benefit from future research.",

This series examines outcomes for tibial artery bypass using HePTFE and SVG over a contemporaneous time period.\nA retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted for 112 tibial bypasses (62 HePTFE, 50 SVG) performed from November 2006 to January 2009. Demographics for age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, and end-stage renal disease were similar. Indications for revascularization were also similar: disabling claudication, 9%; rest pain, 25%; and tissue loss, 66%. The HePTFE group included more reoperative procedures (45% vs 26%). All HePTFE bypasses were performed using an autologous vein patch at the distal anastomosis. Postoperative graft surveillance by pulse examination, ankle-brachial index, and duplex ultrasound imaging occurred at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 12 months. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis evaluated results in patients with no missing variables.\nHePTFE and SVG bypasses demonstrated no significant differences in target tibial artery distribution: anterior tibial (15 vs 17), dorsalis pedis (4 vs 5), posterior tibial (22 vs 16), and peroneal (21 vs 12). Graft occlusion occurred in 19 patients (16.9%) during follow-up. Primary patency at 1 year was 75.4% for HePTFE and 86.0% for SVG. There was no significant difference in primary patency due to sex (male, 78%; female, 84%), race (white, 82%; African American, 77%), or diabetes mellitus (no diabetes mellitus, 84%; diabetes mellitus, 76%). End-stage renal disease resulted in decreased patency (57%), with an eightfold reduction (95% confidence interval, 1.8%-39.8%; P = .006). SVG patients had a lower risk of occlusion/death (95% confidence interval, 14.2%-94.5%; P > .05). Sixteen amputations were performed, with no significant difference based on conduit.\nThis experience indicates a trend for single-segment quality saphenous vein to remain the conduit of choice for tibial artery bypass compared with HePTFE. Factors relevant to decreased 1-year patency for the entire cohort were end-stage renal disease and nonhealing ulceration as the indication for revascularization. Although relatively short-term, these results do support HePTFE as a viable alternative conduit for patients with absent or poor quality saphenous vein who need a tibial bypass.",

    "abstract": "Evidence for the best treatment strategy for patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) at different stages of renal insufficiency (RI) is rare. Therefore, we determined the benefit of revascularization vs medical therapy (MT) only in CLI patients with different levels of RI.\nThis intention-to-treat cohort study with follow-up at 2, 6, and 12 months was conducted in a consecutive series of 351 patients with CLI. Revascularization by surgical (78 patients) or endovascular techniques (191 patients) was performed in 269 patients. MT as first-line therapy was administered in 82 patients. Patients were grouped according to glomerular filtration rate (GFR), estimated with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation, into absent/mild RI (estimated GFR [eGFR], \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), moderate RI (eGFR, 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), and severe RI (eGFR, <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or dialysis). Primary outcome measures were overall and amputation-free survival. Cox regression models adjusted for baseline characteristics after Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were performed.\nThe mean age differed significantly between groups (P < .001), and patients with absent/mild RI were more often men (P < .001) or smokers (P < .001) and less often hypertensive (P < .001). Risk factor adjustment showed that revascularized CLI patients with absent/mild RI had a longer amputation-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26-0.82; P = .008), higher limb salvage (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.17-0.91; P < .029), and better clinical success than MT patients (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.17-0.65; P = .001). The moderate RI group benefited from revascularization in overall survival (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26-0.99; P = .049), amputation-free survival (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29-0.90; P = .020), and clinical success (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22-0.80; P = .008). A beneficial effect on overall survival was found even in patients with severe RI when revascularized (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12-0.91; P = .032 vs MT).\nPatients with CLI may benefit from revascularization compared with MT alone at all levels of renal impairment. Thus, revascularization should not be withheld in CLI patients at any level of RI.",

    "abstract": "Doxycycline and micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) modulate vein wall remodeling that may be associated with hypoxia in varicose veins (VVs), vein graft stenosis, and deep venous thrombosis. We recently reported that in vitro exposure of non-VV (NVVs) and VVs to hypoxic conditions activates the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. This study investigated the in vitro effects of doxycycline and MPFF on the HIF pathway in hypoxic NVVs and VVs.\nSix NVVs and six VVs obtained from surgery were used to prepare vein organ cultures, which were exposed to hypoxia (1% O(2)), with and without MPFF (10(-5) mol/L) or doxycycline (5 \u03bcg/mL) for 16 hours. The veins were analyzed for HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, and their target gene expression, with real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The differences between gene expressions were tested with one-way analysis of variance with repeated measures, followed by the Dunnett test for multiple comparisons. P < .05 was considered significant.\nTreatment of NVV organ cultures exposed to hypoxia with doxycycline or MPFF did not significantly alter the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 messenger (m)RNA and protein compared with untreated. Doxycycline also did not significantly affect the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 mRNA and protein in VVs exposed to hypoxia compared with untreated VVs. However, MPFF significantly reduced the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 but not HIF-2\u03b1 mRNA in VVs exposed to hypoxia compared with untreated VVs. Interestingly, the reduction of the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA in VVs by MPFF was not reflected at the protein level. The mRNA expression of HIF target genes, namely glucose transporter-1, carbonic anhydrase-9, vascular endothelial growth factor, B-cell lymphoma 2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa protein-interacting protein 3, prolyl hydroxylase domain-2, and prolyl hydroxylase domain-3, was not significantly altered in NVVs and VVs exposed to hypoxia and treated with doxycycline or MPFF compared with those untreated.\nDoxycycline and MPFF at a concentration corresponding to a therapeutic dose do not alter the activation of the HIF pathway in NVV and VV organ cultures exposed to hypoxia. Our findings suggest vein wall remodeling actions in NVVs and VVs are likely not HIF-dependent.",

Interestingly, the reduction of the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA in VVs by MPFF was not reflected at the protein level. The mRNA expression of HIF target genes, namely glucose transporter-1, carbonic anhydrase-9, vascular endothelial growth factor, B-cell lymphoma 2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa protein-interacting protein 3, prolyl hydroxylase domain-2, and prolyl hydroxylase domain-3, was not significantly altered in NVVs and VVs exposed to hypoxia and treated with doxycycline or MPFF compared with those untreated.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of endovascular aneurysm repair has resulted in a decline in open abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs performed by vascular residents. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a similar trend has occurred with open lower extremity revascularization procedures, with increased endovascular procedures producing a decrease in the number of open lower extremity revascularizations. Furthermore, this study evaluates the effect of endovascular procedure volume on the frequency of subtypes of open lower extremity procedures performed.\nThe total number of vascular procedures, lower extremity bypasses, and endovascular interventions from 2000 to 2010 were analyzed from case logs of vascular residents as reported by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.\nThe average number of cases performed by vascular residents has increased by 150% from 463.9 in 2000 to 1168 in 2009, due to the increased number of endovascular procedures. The average number of endovascular revascularizations has increased by 317% from 40.5 performed in 2000 to 168.9 in 2009. Femoral-popliteal bypasses have increased in frequency by 27% whereas the number of infrapopliteal bypass has remained unchanged. The largest difference is seen in femoral endarterectomies with a 234% increase from 3.2 per resident in 2001 to 10.7 per resident in 2010. Comparison of the proportion of femoral-popliteal and tibioperoneal interventions performed by angioplasty or bypass after 2007 revealed that endovascular interventions comprise 50% of procedures in the femoral-popliteal distribution, whereas 65% of infrapopliteal interventions are still performed using open techniques.\nThe number of procedures performed during vascular residency has dramatically increased over the last decade secondary to the increased number of endovascular procedures. The average vascular surgery resident's open operative experience has been stable over the last 10 years, despite the increasing endovascular case volume. Residents perform femoral endarterectomy with increasing frequency, perhaps representing an increasing volume of hybrid procedures. Gaps in information available for evaluating resident training remain a significant obstacle. Moving forward, revision of the current reporting system to a format that more accurately reflects resident experience would be beneficial.",

We determined whether poorer WIQ scores are associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in individuals with and without PAD.\nWe identified 1048 men and women with and without PAD from Chicago-area medical centers. Participants completed the WIQ at baseline and were monitored for a median of 4.5 years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to relate baseline WIQ scores with death, adjusting for age, sex, race, the ankle-brachial index (ABI), comorbidities, and other covariates.\nDuring follow-up, 461 participants (44.0%) died, including 158 deaths from CVD. PAD participants in the lowest baseline quartile of the WIQ stair-climbing scores had higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.66, P = .02) and higher CVD mortality (hazard ratio, 3.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-7.47, P = .01) compared with those with the highest baseline WIQ stair-climbing score. Among PAD participants, there were no significant associations of lower baseline WIQ distance or speed scores with rates of all-cause mortality (P = .20 and P = .07 for trend, respectively) or CVD mortality (P = .51 and P = .33 for trend, respectively).

Postoperatively, all patients were maintained on antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel or aspirin, or both. Mean follow-up was 22 \u00b1 17 months (range, 1-57 months). One patient with one aneurysm was lost to follow-up. Primary and secondary patencies were both 91.2% at 1 year and were 85.5% and 91.2%, respectively, at 2 years. The limb salvage rate was 100%. Four stent graft failures occurred at a mean of 12.3 \u00b1 11 months. One technical failure due to stent graft infolding required conversion to an open femoral-popliteal bypass. Three additional graft failures occurred in patients with poor (single-vessel) runoff. Compared with patients with two- or three-vessel runoff, the graft failure rate in patients with single-vessel runoff was statistically significant (P = .02). Two of the graft failures were successfully treated with open thrombectomy, and one required a tibial artery bypass for limb salvage.\nEndovascular repair of PAAs is feasible and has acceptable midterm patency rates. Poor distal runoff predicted graft failure.",

    "abstract": "The appropriate application of endovascular intervention vs bypass for both critical limb ischemia (CLI) and intermittent claudication (IC) remains controversial, and outcomes from large, contemporary series are critical to help inform treatment decisions. Therefore, we sought to define the early and 1-year outcomes of lower extremity bypass (LEB) in a large, multicenter regional cohort, and analyze trends in the use of LEB with or without prior endovascular interventions.\nThe Vascular Study Group of New England database was used to identify all infrainguinal LEB procedures performed between 2003 and 2009. The primary study endpoint was 1-year amputation-free survival (AFS). Secondary endpoints included in-hospital mortality and morbidity, including major adverse cardiac events. Trend analyses were conducted to identify annual trends in the proportion of LEBs performed for an indication of IC, in-hospital outcomes, including mortality and morbidity, and 1-year outcomes, including AFS. Analyses were performed on the entire cohort and then stratified by indication.\nBetween 2003 and 2009, 2907 patients were identified who underwent LEBs (72% for CLI; 28% for IC). The proportion that underwent LEB for IC increased significantly over the study period (from 19% to 31%; P < .0001). There was a significant increase over time in the proportion of LEBs performed after a previous endovascular intervention among both CLIs (from 11% to 24%; P < .0001) and ICs (from 13% to 23%; P = .02). Neither in-hospital mortality nor cardiac event rates changed significantly among either group. There was no significant change in 1-year AFS in patients with IC (97% in 2003 and 98% in 2008; P for trend .63) or in patients with CLI (73% in 2003 and 81% in 2008; P = .10).\nOver the last 7 years, significant changes in patient selection for LEBs have occurred in New England. The proportion of LEBs performed for ICs as opposed to CLIs has increased. Patients are much more likely to have undergone prior endovascular interventions before undergoing a bypass. In-hospital and 1-year outcomes after LEB for both IC and CLI have remained excellent with no significant changes in AFS.",

    "abstract": "Establishing an aneurysm model using simple and easy operative techniques is desirable to develop new endovascular treatment devices such as stent grafts. We developed an aneurysm model using the external iliac arteries (EIAs) of adult Beagles, a relatively large animal that we thought would be easy to handle, using simple and less complicated endovascular procedures. In addition, we evaluated the generated aneurysm model histologically and determined the factors that were necessary for creating more dilated aneurysms.\nExperimental animals consisted of 16 beagles (average weight, 14.0 kg). The animals were divided into four groups (S, E, B+S, and B+E). Eight Beagles were in the S and E groups, without balloon dilation. S group Beagles were injected with normal saline into the right EIA and served as a control group. Elastase was injected into the left EIA of the same Beagles (E group). Eight Beagles were in the B+S and B+E groups with balloon dilation. After balloon dilation, normal saline was injected into right EIA of the B+S group. Elastase was injected into the left EIA of the same Beagles (B+E). After 4 weeks, we measured the EIA diameter using abdominal ultrasound imaging from a body surface. Both sides of the EIA were harvested. We evaluated the dilation rate of the EIA diameter, and histologically, evaluated the disappearance of the internal elastic lamina, degeneration and disappearance of medial smooth muscle and the external elastic lamina, and neointimal thickening.\nInner diameters were dilated more in the B+E group vs the other groups. The B+E group internal elastic lamina had almost disappeared, with significantly more severe degeneration and disappearance of external elastic lamina.\nWe developed a muscular artery aneurysm model using the EIA arteries of adult Beagles and a simple endovascular procedure. Histologically, internal and external elastic lamina degeneration was an important factor to create significantly dilated aneurysms in this muscular artery model.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate our experience with the endovascular treatment of total occlusions of the mesenteric and celiac arteries.\nWe performed a retrospective review of endovascular stenting of 27 nonembolic total occlusions of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and celiac artery (CA) between July 2004 and July 2011 (26 patients, 16 females; mean age, 62 \u00b1 13 years). A variety of demographic, lesion-related and procedure-related variables were evaluated for potential impact of technical success and patency. The follow-up protocol included clinical assessment, and color and spectral Doppler evaluation of the stented vessel(s).\nThe clinical presentation was chronic mesenteric ischemia in 12 patients, acute mesenteric vascular syndromes in 10 patients, foregut ischemia/ischemic pancreatitis in three patients, and prior to endovascular repair of aortic aneurysm in one patient. The treated vessel was SMA in 22 procedures, CA in three, and both SMA and CA in one. Technical success was achieved in 23 of the 27 attempted recanalizations (85%). Three patients who failed the attempt underwent open bypass, and another one underwent retrograde recanalization and stenting of the SMA. Procedure success was only significantly related to patient age <70 years or procedure performance after the year 2006. Notably, the presence of a stump, ostial plaque, extensive vascular calcification, recanalization route (intraluminal vs subintimal), occlusion length, and vessel diameter had no significant impact on procedure success. Traditional duplex criteria proved unreliable in predicting restenosis. Life table analysis of freedom from symptom recurrence showed a primary and assisted rates of 58% and 80% at 1 year, and 33% and 60% at 2 years, respectively. Clinical recurrences developed in six patients (four presented with abdominal angina and weight loss, two presented with abdominal catastrophe). There were six access-related complications and no procedural deaths. Four delayed deaths occurred during follow-up (two cardiac causes, two due to abdominal sepsis).\nEndovascular recanalization of mesenteric artery occlusion is both feasible and successful, provided careful planning is used.",

    "results": "The clinical presentation was chronic mesenteric ischemia in 12 patients, acute mesenteric vascular syndromes in 10 patients, foregut ischemia/ischemic pancreatitis in three patients, and prior to endovascular repair of aortic aneurysm in one patient. The treated vessel was SMA in 22 procedures, CA in three, and both SMA and CA in one. Technical success was achieved in 23 of the 27 attempted recanalizations (85%). Three patients who failed the attempt underwent open bypass, and another one underwent retrograde recanalization and stenting of the SMA. Procedure success was only significantly related to patient age <70 years or procedure performance after the year 2006. Notably, the presence of a stump, ostial plaque, extensive vascular calcification, recanalization route (intraluminal vs subintimal), occlusion length, and vessel diameter had no significant impact on procedure success. Traditional duplex criteria proved unreliable in predicting restenosis. Life table analysis of freedom from symptom recurrence showed a primary and assisted rates of 58% and 80% at 1 year, and 33% and 60% at 2 years, respectively. Clinical recurrences developed in six patients (four presented with abdominal angina and weight loss, two presented with abdominal catastrophe). There were six access-related complications and no procedural deaths. Four delayed deaths occurred during follow-up (two cardiac causes, two due to abdominal sepsis).",

    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a cause of end-stage renal disease associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms. We report a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease who received an allograft kidney and subsequently underwent treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with aortic ligation and axillary-bifemoral bypass. After years of graft function, bypass thrombosis resulted in dialysis-dependent renal failure. Aortobifemoral bypass resulted in immediate restoration of allograft function despite 6 months of prior renal failure. Aortic reconstruction restored renal function to a hibernating allograft long after clinical graft failure from arterial ischemia, a phenomenon not previously reported in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Secondary interventions after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) remain a concern. Most are simple catheter-based procedures, but in some instances, open conversions (OCs) are required and carry a worse outcome. We reviewed our experience to characterize these OCs.\nA retrospective review was conducted of all patients who underwent an OC after a previous EVAR for an aneurysm-related indication from 2001 to 2010. Clinical outcomes are reported.\nData were reviewed for 44 patients (77% men) with a mean age of 74 years (range, 55-90 years). The average time from EVAR to the first OC was 45 months (range, 2-190 months). In six patients (14%), the initial EVAR was at another institution. The endografts used were Ancure in 16, Excluder in 13, AneuRx in eight, Zenith in three, Lifepath in one, Renu in one, and undetermined in two. Twenty-two patients had previously undergone a total of 32 endovascular reinterventions before their index OC. Indications for OC were aneurysm expansion in 28 (64%), rupture in 12 (27%), and infection in four (9%). The endograft was preserved in situ in 10 patients (23%). Explantation was partial in 18 (41%) or complete in 16 (36%). Endograft preservation was used for type II endoleak in all but one patient by selective ligation of the culprit arteries (lumbar in four, inferior mesenteric artery in five, and middle sacral in one). Proximal neck banding was performed in one type Ia endoleak. Overall morbidity was 55%, and mortality was 18%. No deaths occurred in a subgroup of patients who underwent endograft preservation with selective ligation of culprit vessels for type II endoleak. Intraoperative complications included bowel injury in two, bleeding in two, splenectomy in one, and ureteral injury in one. At a mean follow-up of 20 months, two patients underwent additional procedures after the index OC: one after endograft preservation and one after partial explantation. None of the patients who underwent elective OC with endograft preservation required subsequent endograft explantation.\nMost OCs after EVAR are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, except when electively treating an isolated type II endoleak with ligation of branches and preservation of the endograft.",

    "abstract": "Sac shrinkage is a surrogate marker of success after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). We set out to determine if any common cardioprotective medications had a beneficial effect on sac shrinkage.\nThis retrospective observational study took place at Leeds Vascular Institute, a tertiary vascular unit in the Northern United Kingdom. The cohort comprised 149 patients undergoing EVAR between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2008. Medication use was recorded at intervention (verified at study completion in 33 patients), and patients were monitored for 2 years. The main outcome measures were the effect of medication on sac shrinkage as determined by percentage change in maximal idealized cross-sectional area of the aneurysm at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years by linear regression model, in addition to 2-year endoleak and death rates determined by a binary logistic regression model.\nAfter exclusions, 112 patients, who were a median age of 78 years (interquartile range, 78-83 years), remained for analysis. The median Glasgow Aneurysm Score was 85 (interquartile range, 79-92). At 2 years, mortality was 13.4%, endoleak developed in 37.5%, and significant endoleak developed in 14.3%. Patients taking a calcium channel blocker had enhanced sac shrinkage, compared with those not taking a calcium channel blocker, by 6.6% at 6 months (-3.0% to 16.3%, P = .09), 12.3% at 1 year (2.9% to 21.7%, P = .008), and 13.1% at 2 years (0.005% to 26.2%, P = .007) independent of other medication use, graft type, endoleak development, or death.\nEnhanced sac shrinkage occurred after EVAR in patients taking calcium channel blockers. This warrants further study in other centers and at the molecular level.",

    "abstract": "The feasibility of total laparoscopic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair has been well established. In a previous case-control study, we showed that the postoperative courses of total laparoscopic and open AAA repairs were similar. The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term results of these techniques in the same cohort of patients.\nThirty patients with AAAs treated by total laparoscopic repair between July 2003 and December 2004 (group I) were matched in a case-control fashion by morphology and American Society of Anesthesiologists class with 30 patients who underwent open AAA repair between April 1997 and May 2004 (group II). Patients who survived the intervention were followed up during 5 years. Follow-up consisted of physical examination and duplex ultrasonography at 1 month and yearly thereafter. Group I patients had an additional control computed tomography scan within the first 3 months postoperatively.\nFive-year cumulative survival rates were similar (group I: 83% \u00b1 7% vs group II: 79% \u00b1 7%; log-rank test, P = .69). No late aneurysm-related death occurred during the follow-up period. Incisional hernias were more likely to occur in group II patients (group I: 0% vs group II: 15.4%; P = .047). Incidence of postoperative sexual dysfunction was similar in both groups (group I: 22.2% vs group II: 25.0%; P = not significant [NS]). No late reintervention was recorded in group I, whereas 2 patients in group II had incisional hernia repair. At 5 years, no graft sepsis or anastomotic pseudoaneurysm was reported.\nThis study suggests that total laparoscopic AAA repair provides good long-term results, comparable to those of open repair in terms of aneurysm-related mortality and morbidity. It may reduce the incidence of laparotomy-related complications.",

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) remains difficult to diagnose, carries a high rate of complications, and is associated with significant mortality. We evaluated our experience with AMI over the last 2 decades to evaluate changes in management and assess current outcomes.\nData from consecutive patients who underwent arterial revascularization for AMI over a 20-year period (January 1990-January 2010) were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, treatment modalities, and outcomes over the last decade (2000-2010) were compared with those of the preceding decade (1990-1999) previously reported.\nOver the last 2 decades, 93 patients with AMI underwent emergency arterial revascularization. Forty-five patients were treated during the 1990s and 48 during the 2000s. The majority of these patients were transferred from outside facilities. Patient demographics and risk factors were similar between the 2 decades with the exception that the more contemporary patients were significantly older (65.1 \u00b1 14 vs 71.3 \u00b1 14; P = .04). Etiology remained constant between the groups with in situ thrombosis being the most common followed by arterial embolus. The majority of patients were treated with open revascularization. Endovascular therapy alone or as a hybrid procedure was used in 11 total patients, eight of which were treated in the last 10 years. The use of second-look laparotomy was much more liberal in the last decade (80% vs 48%; P = .003) Thirty-day mortality was 27% in the 1990s and 17% during the 2000s (P = 0.28). Major adverse events occurred in 47% of patients with no difference between decades. There was no significant difference in outcomes between open and endovascular revascularization. On univariate analysis, elevated SVS comorbidity score, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease predicted early death, while a history of chronic mesenteric ischemia appeared protective. On multivariate analysis, no factor independently predicted perioperative mortality. Bowel resection and cerebrovascular disease predicted postoperative morbidity, while advanced age and connective tissue disease predicted long-term mortality.\nMorbidity and mortality from AMI continues to be high. Revascularization by endovascular means, although more frequent in the last decade, was still utilized in a minority of patients with severe AMI. Advanced ischemia with bowel infarction at presentation, and markers of generalized atherosclerosis are predictors of poor outcome, while history of chronic mesenteric ischemia is associated with better outcome.",

We hypothesize that BPP would provide a reasonable alternative to autologous vein patches in infected fields.\nWe used BPP to repair 51 arteriotomies (25 brachial, 23 femoral, three popliteal) in 48 consecutive patients (mean age, 68 years; 65% men, 75% diabetic, 67% dialysis dependent) undergoing removal of infected (33 gram-positive, three gram-negative, eight mixed flora, and four culture-negative) polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (35 arteriovenous grafts, nine femoral-distal bypasses, and four femoral patch angioplasties) between January 2007 and January 2011. Patient records were retrospectively reviewed and outcomes, including death, rupture, secondary reconstruction, and infection, were recorded.\nOver a mean follow-up of 2.1 years (range, 3-48 months), 50 of 51 patches remained in place without evidence of recurrent infection, rupture, or revision.

    "abstract": "This study analyzes the experience of a single center using hybrid stainless steel-based endovascular stent graft repair of acute complicated and chronic type B aortic dissection aneurysm, and assesses the proximal and distal aortic morphologic changes of the midterm results.\nBetween November 2006 and March 2011, 61 patients with type B aortic dissection underwent stainless steel-based stent graft repair and were divided into an acute complicated dissection group (AD; n = 33) and a chronic dissection aneurysm group (CD; n = 28). Serial computed tomography (CT) images were obtained to evaluate the changes of true and false lumen diameter at four levels during the postoperative period.\nThe stent graft was successfully implanted in all patients (100%), with two surgical mortalities in the AD group and low perioperative morbidity (3.6%) of stroke and paraplegia. The cumulative survival rates of the two groups were similar (77.6% and 89.0%; P = .585) in a mean follow-up period of 24.1 \u00b1 15.6 months. Complete thrombosis of the thoracic false lumen down to the diaphragm level was achieved in 80.6% of the patients in the AD group and 88.5% in the CD group without significant difference (P = .221), but the complete regression rate of the thoracic false lumen down to the diaphragm level showed a tendency of propitious remodeling in the AD group (54.8% vs 30.8%; P = .068). During follow-up, despite the proximal changes of stented true and adjacent false lumen diameter being significantly increased and decreased, respectively, in both acute and chronic settings (P < .05), they were less prominent at the distal aorta in the CD aneurysm group. Intimomedial erosion of the distal end of the stent graft occurred in both acute (n = 6; 18.9%) and chronic (n = 10; 35.7%; P = .121) dissection settings after mean follow-up of 14.0 \u00b1 4.8 months in the AD group and 24.8 \u00b1 5.9 months in the CD group. Three patients with chronic dissection developed either pseudoaneurysm or true lumen compromise by expanded false lumen thrombi and required re-endografting.\nEndovascular stainless steel-based stent graft implantation with vascular bypass to gain a sufficient proximal landing zone is feasible for type B aortic dissection and has low early and midterm mortality and morbidity in both the acute and chronic phases. Although early intervention might result in more favorable aortic remodeling with a higher possibility of complete regression and lower risk of late distal erosion, longer-term follow-up still necessitates continuous careful surveillance of the entire aorta, especially the distal condition.",

    "abstract": "Cost-effectiveness has become an important end point in comparing therapies that may be considered to have clinical equipoise. While controversial, some feel that recent multicenter randomized controlled trials have codified clinical equipoise between carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS).\nA retrospective analysis of hospital cost and 30-day clinical outcomes was performed on patients undergoing CEA and CAS between January 1, 2008 and September 30, 2010 at a single tertiary referral institution. Cost, not charges, of the index hospitalization was divided into supply, labor, facility, and miscellaneous categories. All costs were normalized to 2010 values.\nA total of 306 patients underwent either CEA (n = 174) or CAS (n = 132). Mean hospital cost for CAS was $9426 \u00b1 $5776 while CEA cost was $6734 \u00b1 $3935 (P < .0001). This cost differential was driven by the significantly higher direct supply costs for CAS ($5634) vs CEA ($1967) (P \u2264 .0001). The higher costs for CAS were seen consistently in symptomatic, asymptomatic, elective, and urgent subgroups. Patients undergoing CAS who were enrolled in a trial or registry (53.8%) incurred significantly less cost ($7779 \u00b1 $3525) compared to those who were not ($11,279 \u00b1 $7114; P = .0004). Patients undergoing CEA trended toward a higher prevalence of being symptomatic (44.8%) compared to CAS (34.0%; P = .058). Age was not significantly different between patients undergoing CEA and CAS (70.2 vs 72.0, respectively; P = .36). Coronary artery disease was more common in patients undergoing CAS (60.3% vs 39%; P = .0001). The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, hypertension, and diabetes was not significantly different between cohorts. Thirty-day combined stroke/death/myocardial infarction rate was 2.3% (4 of 174) in the CEA group and 3.8% (5 of 132) in the CAS group, P = .5. Overall length of stay (LOS) was 2.1 days in both groups (P = .9). LOS was higher for urgent interventions (7.3-7.5 days) and symptomatic status (2.9-3.5 days) when compared to patients treated electively (1.3-1.4 days).\nTreatment of carotid disease with CAS was 40% more costly than CEA and did not provide better clinical outcomes or a reduction in LOS. These trends were consistent in symptomatic, asymptomatic, urgent, and elective subgroups At present, CAS cannot be considered a cost-effective treatment for carotid disease.",

    "abstract": "Several anatomic factors have been identified as predictive of sac behavior after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The effects of statin therapy on aneurysm sac size reduction remain controversial. This study tested the hypothesis that statin therapy enhances aneurysmal sac regression after EVAR.\nThis monocentric retrospective study included patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms treated by EVAR using the Zenith (Cook, Bloomington, Ind) graft device. We excluded patients presenting with perioperative sac enlargement factors such as endoleaks, endotension, infectious, inflammatory, ruptured, or anastomotic aneurysms. We prospectively assessed standard clinical and anatomic data, as well as statin use, at the time of EVAR and during follow-up. The primary end point was the decrease in the largest transverse aortic diameter at 24 months compared with the preoperative diameter.\nAmong 166 patients treated by a Zenith device and meeting the inclusion criteria, 120 were identified as statin users and 46 as nonstatin users, with comparable characteristics. At 24 months of follow-up, statin group patients had a greater aneurysm sac reduction (25% vs 14%; P < .0001). At a threshold of 5 mm in diameter regression, statin use was a positive factor of retraction (odds ratio, 7.93; 95% confidence interval, 3.22-15.52; P < .0001). Multivariate analysis revealed statin use was an independent predictive factor of sac regression (adjusted odds ratio, 9.39; 95% confidence interval, 3.45-25.56).\nThis study showed that statin use was predictive of sac regression after EVAR with the Zenith graft device. This effect needs to be confirmed by larger randomized trials or by large population evaluation.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the efficacy of antibiotic-loaded polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) beads in the treatment of lower extremity vascular surgical site infections (VSSIs).\nThis was a retrospective review of all patients with a VSSI of a lower extremity bypass treated with antibiotic-loaded PMMA beads and culture-specific antibiotics during a 4.5-year period. Data collected included patient demographics, comorbidities, site of initial graft infection, symptoms and signs at presentation, initial and additional surgical debridement, wound culture results, type of antibiotic beads implanted, and graft treatment strategy, comprising conduit preservation or in situ replacement, with associated soft tissue management by muscle flap or vacuum-assisted closure. Primary outcome measures included death, recurrent infection, and limb salvage.\nForty patients developed 42 extracavitary lower extremity VSSIs (bilateral groin infections in two). Patients were treated according to our treatment algorithm with antibiotic-impregnated PMMA beads. Previous reconstructions included nine aortofemoral bypasses (groin infection only), 20 infrainguinal bypasses, five extra-anatomic bypasses, five femoral interpositions, two combined inflow-outflow bypass procedures, and one patch angioplasty with VSSI. Cultures isolated 59 pathogens (39 gram-positive, 18 gram-negative, 2 Candida spp). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from 10 VSSs (23.8%) overall and from 27.7% of those patients with attempted graft preservation or in situ reconstructions. Two patients (4.8%) had no growth despite clinical signs of infection. Repeat VSS exploration and culture results led to an average of 1.4 bead replacements before definitive treatment. Final treatment strategy included graft preservation of patent bypasses in 28, partial graft excision with in situ replacement in eight, graft removal only with residual graft remaining at implant site (ie, incorporated anastomotic conduit, 11.9%) in five, and extra-anatomic reconstruction in one. Sartorius muscle flap was performed in 14 groin infections (37.8%). The 30-day mortality was 0%, and limb loss was 7.1% (n = 3). At the median follow-up of 17 months, the limb loss was 21.4% and the recurrent infection rate was 19.4% (seven of 36) in those with attempted graft preservation or in situ replacement.\nAntibiotic-loaded PMMA beads may serve as an adjunct in the management of VSSIs and may also expand treatment options for graft preservation or in situ reconstruction, with expected recurrent infection rate approaching 20%. Further experience with this adjunct may help elucidate its role in the management of this complicated problem, including the need for bead exchanges, until perigraft cultures are free of microbes.",

    "abstract": "Flow patterns and shear forces in native coronary arteries are more protective against neointimal hyperplasia than those in femoral arteries. Yet, the caliber mismatch with their target arteries makes coronary artery bypass grafts more likely to encounter intimal hyperplasia than their infrainguinal counterparts due to the resultant slow flow velocity and decreased wall stress. To allow a site-specific, flow-related comparison of remodeling behavior, saphenous vein bypass grafts were simultaneously implanted in femoral and coronary positions.\nSaphenous vein grafts were concomitantly implanted as coronary and femoral bypass grafts using a senescent nonhuman primate model. Duplex ultrasound-based blood flow velocity profiles and vein graft and target artery dimensions were correlated with dimensional and histomorphologic graft remodeling in large, senescent Chacma baboons (n = 8; 28.1 \u00b1 4.9 kg) during a 24-week period.\nAt implantation, the cross-sectional quotient (Q(c)) between target arteries and vein grafts was 0.62 \u00b1 0.10 for femoral grafts vs 0.17 \u00b1 0.06 for coronary grafts, resulting in a dimensional graft-to-artery mismatch 3.6 times higher (P < .0001) in coronary grafts. Together with different velocity profiles, these site-specific dimensional discrepancies resulted in a 57.9% \u00b1 19.4% lower maximum flow velocity (P = .0048), 48.1% \u00b1 23.6% lower maximal cycling wall shear stress (P = .012), and 62.2% \u00b1 21.2% lower mean velocity (P = .007) in coronary grafts. After 24 weeks, the luminal diameter of all coronary grafts had contracted by 63%, from an inner diameter of 4.49 \u00b1 0.60 to 1.68 \u00b1 0.63 mm (P < .0001; subintimal diameter: -41.5%; P = .002), whereas 57% of the femoral interposition grafts had dilated by 31%, from 4.21 \u00b1 0.25 to 5.53 \u00b1 1.30 mm (P = .020). Neointimal tissue was 2.3 times thicker in coronary than in femoral grafts (561 \u00b1 73 vs 240 \u00b1 149 \u03bcm; P = .001). Overall, the luminal area of coronary grafts was an average of 4.1 times smaller than that of femoral grafts.\nAlthough coronary and infrainguinal bypass surgery uses saphenous veins as conduits, they undergo significantly different remodeling processes in these two anatomic positions.",

Preoperative workup included National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) neurological assessment on admission, immediately before surgery and at discharge, carotid duplex scan, brain contrast-enhanced head computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). End points were perioperative (30-day) neurological mortality, NIHSS score variation, and hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke recurrence. Patients were evaluated according to clinical presentation (SIE or cTIA), timing of surgery, and presence of brain infarction on neuroimaging.\nBetween January 2005 and December 2009, 48 patients were submitted to emergency surgery. CEAs were performed from 1 to 24 hours from onset of symptoms (mean, 10.16 \u00b1 7.75). Twenty-six patients presented an SIE with a worsening NIHSS score between admission and surgery, and 22 presented \u2265 3 cTIAs with a normal NIHSS score (= 0) immediately before surgery. An ischemic brain lesion was detected in four patients with SIE and eight patients with cTIA. All patients with cTIA presented a persistent NIHSS normal score before and after surgery. Twenty-five patients with SIE presented an NIHSS score improvement after surgery. Mean NIHSS score was 5.30 \u00b1 2.81 before surgery and 0.54 \u00b1 0.77 at discharge in the SIE group (P < .0001). One patient with SIE had a hemorrhagic transformation of an undetected brain ischemic lesion after surgery, with progressive neurological deterioration and death (2%).\nDue to the absence of randomized controlled trials of CEA for neurologically unstable patients, data currently available do not support a policy of emergency CEA in those patients. Our results suggest that a fast protocol, including CT scans and carotid duplex ultrasound scans in neurologically unstable patients, could help identify those that can be safely submitted to emergency CEA.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular stents are accepted therapy for iliac artery stenoses and occlusions. Surgery is the recommended therapy for patients with severe iliac artery disease, including those with the combination of ipsilateral common iliac artery (CIA) and external iliac artery (EIA) stenoses/occlusions. This study compared patient outcomes, including late open conversion rates, for combined ipsilateral CIA and EIA stenting vs CIA or EIA stents alone.\nBetween 1998 and 2010, 588 patients underwent iliac artery stenting at two institutions. Patient comorbidities and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed, and analyses were performed using multivariate regression and Kaplan-Meier methods.\nThere were 436 extremities with CIA stents, 195 with EIA stents, and 157 with CIA and EIA stents. The groups did not differ significantly in demographics, comorbidities, or treatment indications. During follow-up, 183 patients died, 95 underwent an endovascular reintervention, and 48 required late open conversion. For patients in the CIA or EIA stent group, the mean \u00b1 standard error survival was 5.3 \u00b1 0.3 years, secondary endovascular intervention-free survival was 7.4 \u00b1 0.6 years, late open conversion-free survival was 9.8 \u00b1 0.4 years, and amputation-free survival was 7.6 \u00b1 0.4 years. In the CIA and EIA stent group, survival was 6.1 \u00b1 0.6 years, secondary endovascular intervention-free survival was 7.2 \u00b1 0.6 years, late open conversion-free survival was 9.0 \u00b1 1.1 years, and amputation-free survival was 8.4 \u00b1 0.5 years. Survival, reintervention-free survival, late open conversion-free survival, and amputation-free survival were all similar between patient groups (all P > .05). CIA and EIA stenting in combination was not a predictor of death, reintervention, late open conversion, or amputation.\nOutcomes are similar for patients with CIA or EIA stents and for those with combined ipsilateral CIA and EIA stents. Late open conversions for iliac artery stent failure are uncommon and not influenced by the location or extent of prior iliac artery stent placement. Endovascular therapy for aortoiliac disease should be extended to consider selected patients with ipsilateral CIA and EIA stenoses/occlusions.",

For patients in the CIA or EIA stent group, the mean \u00b1 standard error survival was 5.3 \u00b1 0.3 years, secondary endovascular intervention-free survival was 7.4 \u00b1 0.6 years, late open conversion-free survival was 9.8 \u00b1 0.4 years, and amputation-free survival was 7.6 \u00b1 0.4 years. In the CIA and EIA stent group, survival was 6.1 \u00b1 0.6 years, secondary endovascular intervention-free survival was 7.2 \u00b1 0.6 years, late open conversion-free survival was 9.0 \u00b1 1.1 years, and amputation-free survival was 8.4 \u00b1 0.5 years. Survival, reintervention-free survival, late open conversion-free survival, and amputation-free survival were all similar between patient groups (all P > .05). CIA and EIA stenting in combination was not a predictor of death, reintervention, late open conversion, or amputation.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound scan-guided access allows for direct visualization of the access artery during percutaneous endovascular aortic aneurysm repair. We hypothesized that the use of ultrasound scan guidance allowed us to safely increase the utilization of percutaneous endovascular aortic aneurysm repair to almost all patients and decrease access complications.\nA retrospective chart review of all elective endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs, both abdominal and descending thoracic, from 2005 to 2010 was performed. Patients were identified using International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification Codes and stratified based on access type: percutaneous vs cut-down. We examined the success rate of percutaneous access and the cause of failure. Sheath size was large (18-24 F) or small (12-16 F). Minimum access vessel diameter was also measured. Outcomes were wound complications (infections or clinically significant hematomas that delayed discharge or required transfusion), operative and incision time, length of stay, and discharge disposition. Predictors of percutaneous failure were identified.\nOne hundred sixty-eight patients (296 arteries) had percutaneous access endovascular aneurysm repair (P-EVAR) whereas 131 patients (226 arteries) had femoral cutdown access EVAR. Ultrasound scan-guided access was introduced in 2007. P-EVAR increased from zero cases in 2005 to 92.3% of all elective cases in 2010. The success rate with percutaneous access was 96%. Failures requiring open surgical repair of the artery included seven for hemorrhage and six for flow-limiting stenosis or occlusion of the femoral artery. P-EVAR had fewer wound complications (0.7% vs 7.4%; P = .001), shorter operative time (153.3 vs 201.5 minutes; P < .001), and larger minimal access vessel diameter (6.7 mm vs 6.1 mm; P < .01). Patients with failed percutaneous access had smaller minimal access vessel diameters when compared to successful P-EVAR (4.9 mm vs 6.8 mm; P < .001). More failures occurred in small sheaths than large ones (7.4% vs 1.9%; P = .02). Access vessel diameter <5 mm is predictive of percutaneous failure (16.7% of vessels <5 mm failed vs 2.4% of vessels \u2265 5 mm failed; P < .001; odds ratio, 7.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.58-33.8; P = .01).\nUltrasound scan-guided P-EVAR can be performed in the vast majority of patients with a high success rate, shorter operative times, and fewer wound complications. Access vessel diameters <5 mm are at greater risk for percutaneous failure and should be treated selectively.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality after bariatric surgery. However, the concurrent prophylactic placement of an inferior vena cava filter (CPIVCF) in patients undergoing bariatric operations remains controversial. This study used the Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database (BOLD) to establish associated characters and determine outcomes of CPIVCF for patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GB) and adjustable gastric banding (AB) surgeries.\nWe analyzed BOLD, a database of bariatric surgery patient information. GB and AB operations were categorized into open and laparoscopic approaches. Univariate logistic regressions were used to compare between non-CPIVCF and concurrent CPIVCF groups. Significant variables (P < .05) were subsequently input into multivariate regression models: CPIVCF was retained in each model.\nA total of 322 CPIVCFs (0.33%) were identified from 97,218 GB and AB operations performed between 2007 and 2010 in this retrospective registry study. Significant differences were identified in male gender (21.1% vs 31.4%; P < .001), preoperative body mass index (BMI; 44.5 \u00b1 6.6 vs 45.3 \u00b1 7; P < .001), and African-American race (10.5% vs 18%; P < .001) between non-CPIVCF and CPIVCF groups. The CPIVCF group had more patients with previous nonbariatric surgery (50% vs 43.6%; P = .02), a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE; 21.4% vs 3.1%; P < .001), impairment of functional status (7.8% vs 3.1%; P < .001), lower extremity edema (47.2% vs 27.1%; P < .001), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (7.1% vs 2.1%; P < .001), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (58.1% vs 43.3%; P < .001), and pulmonary hypertension (13% vs 4.1%; P < .001). Patients in the CPIVCF group were more likely to receive GB than gastric banding (77% vs 58.1%; P < .001) and an open surgical approach (21.4% vs 4.8%; P < .001). Operative duration was longer in the CPIVCF group (119 \u00b1 67 vs 89 \u00b1 52 minutes; P < .001). The CPIVCF group also had a longer length of hospital stay (3 \u00b1 2 vs 2 \u00b1 6 days; P = .048), was associated with higher incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT; 0.93% vs 0.12%; P < .001), and had a higher mortality (0.31% vs 0.03%; P = .003) from PE and indeterminate causes. In multivariate analysis, male gender, African-American race, previous nonbariatric surgery, a high BMI, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, history of VTE, lower extremity edema, and pulmonary hypertension were preoperative factors associated with CPIVCF.\nCPIVCF was associated with specific clinical features, increased health care resource utilization, and a higher mortality in patients undergoing bariatric operations. Although selected patient characteristics influence surgeons to perform CPIVCF, this study was unable to establish an outcome benefit for CPIVCF.",

    "abstract": "Renal dysfunction following endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality. We studied the use of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) as a non-nephrotoxic contrast agent for EVAR.\nRecorded data from 114 consecutive patients who underwent EVAR with CO(2) as the contrast agent over 44 months were retrospectively analyzed. CO(2) was used exclusively in 72 patients and in an additional 42 patients iodinated contrast (IC) was given (mean, 37 mL). Renal and hypogastric artery localization and completion angiography were done with CO(2) in all patients, including additional arterial embolization in 16 cases. Preoperative National Kidney Foundation glomerular filtration rate (GFR) classification was normal in 16 patients, mildly decreased in 52, moderate to severely decreased in 44, and two patients were on dialysis.\nAll graft deployments were successful with no surgical conversions. CO(2) angiography identified 20 endoleaks (two type 1, 16 type 2, and two type 4) and three unintentionally covered arteries. Additional use of IC in 42 patients did not modify the procedure in any case. When compared with a cohort of patients who underwent EVAR using exclusively IC, the operative time was shorter with CO(2) (177 vs 194 minutes; P = .01); fluoroscopy time was less (21 vs 28 minutes; P = .002), and volume of IC was lower (37 vs 106 mL; P < .001). Postoperatively, there were two deaths, two instances of renal failure requiring dialysis, and no complications related to CO(2) use. Among patients with moderate to severely decreased GFR, those undergoing EVAR with IC had a 12.7% greater decrease in GFR compared with the CO(2) EVAR group (P = .004). At 1, 6, and 12-month follow-up, computed tomography angiography showed well-positioned endografts with the expected patent renal and hypogastric arteries in all patients and no difference in endoleak detection compared with the IC EVAR group. During follow-up, eight transluminal interventions and one open conversion were required, and no aneurysm-related deaths occurred.\nCO(2)-guided EVAR is technically feasible and safe; it eliminates or reduces the need for IC use, may expedite the procedure, and avoids deterioration in renal function in patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency. A prospective trial comparing CO(2) with IC during EVAR is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Video-assisted thoracic sympathectomy provides excellent resolution of palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis but is associated with compensatory hyperhidrosis. Low doses of oxybutynin, an anticholinergic medication that competitively antagonizes the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, can be used to treat palmar hyperhidrosis with fewer side effects.\nThis study evaluated the effectiveness and patient satisfaction of oral oxybutynin at low doses (5 mg twice daily) compared with placebo for treating palmar hyperhidrosis.\nThis was prospective, randomized, and controlled study. From December 2010 to February 2011, 50 consecutive patients with palmar hyperhidrosis were treated with oxybutynin or placebo. Data were collected from 50 patients, but 5 (10.0%) were lost to follow-up. During the first week, patients received 2.5 mg of oxybutynin once daily in the evening. From days 8 to 21, they received 2.5 mg twice daily, and from day 22 to the end of week 6, they received 5 mg twice daily. All patients underwent two evaluations, before and after (6 weeks) the oxybutynin treatment, using a clinical questionnaire and a clinical protocol for quality of life.\nPalmar and axillary hyperhidrosis improved in >70% of the patients, and 47.8% of those presented great improvement. Plantar hyperhidrosis improved in >90% of the patients. Most patients (65.2%) showed improvements in their quality of life. The side effects were minor, with dry mouth being the most frequent (47.8%).\nTreatment of palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis with oxybutynin is a good initial alternative for treatment given that it presents good results and improves quality of life.",

    "abstract": "This study compared calf muscle hemoglobin oxygen saturation (Sto(2)) and exercise performance during standardized treadmill exercise in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) who describe different types of exertional leg pain and compared secondary outcomes consisting of daily ambulatory activity and exercise performance during a 6-minute walk test (6MWT).\nLeg pain symptoms were evaluated in 114 patients with PAD using the San Diego Claudication Questionnaire, by which atypical exertional leg pain was defined in 31, claudication in 37, and leg pain on exertion and rest in 46. Patients were evaluated on a standardized, graded treadmill test during which calf muscle Sto(2) was continuously monitored. The 6MWT distance, Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), and ambulatory activity were monitored during 1 week.\nAll patients experienced symptoms during the treadmill test consistent with claudication. The groups were not significantly different on the primary outcomes of time to reach the minimum calf muscle Sto(2) (P = .350) or peak walking time (P = .238) during treadmill exercise. Patients with atypical leg pain had the highest daily ambulatory activity for total strides per day (P = .032), average daily cadence (P = .010), maximum cadences for durations between 5 minutes (P = .035) and 60 minutes (P = .029), speed score on the WIQ (P = .006), and lowest rating of perceived exertion at the end of the 6MWT (P = .017).\nPAD patients with atypical leg pain have vascular-mediated limitations in exercise performance during standardized treadmill testing similar to patients with claudication and patients with leg pain on exertion and rest but have higher levels of daily ambulatory activity in the community setting and higher perceived ambulatory function.",

    "abstract": "An ideal pharmaceutical treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is to prevent aneurysm formation and development (further dilatation of pre-existing aneurysm). Recent studies have reported that oxidative stress with reactive oxygen species (ROS) is crucial in aneurysm formation. We hypothesized that edaravone, a free-radical scavenger, would attenuate vascular oxidative stress and inhibit AAA formation and development.\nAn AAA model induced with intraluminal elastase and extraluminal calcium chloride was created in 42 rats. Thirty-six rats were divided three groups: a low-dose (group LD; 1 mg/kg/d), high-dose (group HD; 5 mg/kg/d), and control (group C, saline). Edaravone or saline was intraperitoneally injected twice daily, starting 30 minutes before aneurysm preparation. The remaining six rats (group DA) received a delayed edaravone injection (5 mg/kg/d) intraperitoneally, starting 7 days after aneurysm preparation to 28 days. AAA dilatation ratio was calculated. Pathologic examination was performed. ROS expression was semi-quantified by dihydroethidium staining and the oxidative product of DNA induced by ROS, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), by immunohistochemical staining.\nAt day 7, ROS expression and 8-OHdG-positive cells in aneurysm walls were decreased by edaravone treatment (ROS expression: 3.0 \u00b1 0.5 in group LD, 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 in group HD, and 4.8 \u00b1 0.7 in group C; 8-OHdG-positive cells: 106.2 \u00b1 7.8 cells in group LD, 64.5 \u00b1 7.7 cells in group HD, and 136.6 \u00b1 7.4 cells in group C; P < .0001), compared with group C. Edaravone treatment significantly reduced messenger RNA expressions of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in aneurysm walls (MMP-2: 1.1 \u00b1 0.5 in group LD, 0.6 \u00b1 0.1 in group HD, and 2.3 \u00b1 0.4 in group C; P < .001; MMP-9: 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 in group LD, 0.2 \u00b1 0.6 in group HD, and 2.4 \u00b1 0.2 in group C; P < .001). At day 28, aortic walls in groups LD and HD were less dilated, with increased wall thickness and elastin content than those in group C (dilatation ratio: 204.7% \u00b1 16.0% in group C, 156.5% \u00b1 6.6% in group LD, 136.7% \u00b1 2.0% in group HD; P < .0001). Delayed edaravone administration significantly prevented further aneurysm dilatation, with increased elastin content (155.2% \u00b1 2.9% at day 7, 153.1% \u00b1 11.6% at day 28; not significant).\nEdaravone inhibition of ROS can prevent aneurysm formation and expansion in the rat AAA model. Free-radical scavenger edaravone might be an effective pharmaceutical agent for AAA in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to review a single-institution contemporary experience with extracranial aneurysms of the carotid artery.\nA retrospective review was conducted of patients evaluated for an aneurysm of the extracranial carotid artery from 2005 to 2010. Demographics, presentation, and operative management were reviewed. The mean follow-up was 22 months (range, 1-58 months).\nOver the study period, 16 aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms were identified in 15 patients. Of these, 14 aneurysms (in six men and eight women with mean age of 63 years) underwent surgical repair. The mean aneurysm size was 2.45 cm (range, 0.8-5 cm). One aneurysm (7.1%) was associated with neurologic symptoms, and 13 were asymptomatic. The underlying etiology was trauma in five (35.7%), prior carotid endarterectomy in five (35.7%), and degenerative atherosclerosis in four (28.6%). Aneurysms were isolated to the common carotid artery in six (42.9%), internal carotid artery in five (35.7%), and carotid bifurcation in three (21.4%). Five patients underwent aneurysmectomy with primary repair, seven underwent repair with an interposition graft, one required an innominate to common carotid artery bypass, and one patient had a plication and patch angioplasty. No mortalities or neurologic events were documented within 30 days. One patient had transient cranial nerve palsy. One patient required reintervention at 4 months for stenosis of the bypass graft, and one patient died at 10 months from an unrelated condition. There were no neurologic events on follow-up.\nCarotid artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms are uncommon and usually asymptomatic. Prior trauma and carotid surgery were common etiologies. The location of the aneurysms was equally distributed between the internal and common carotid arteries. Surgical repair was safe and effective with no significant morbidity or mortality and good midterm stroke prevention.",

    "abstract": "The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of smoking on perioperative outcomes of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), aneurysm sac behavior, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) neck growth after EVAR, and its effect on stent graft migration during follow-up.\nBaseline characteristics and follow-up data were collected prospectively by patient record forms. Follow-up visits were scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and annually thereafter and included a clinical examination and imaging studies. Patients were stratified in three groups according to their smoking status as nonsmokers, former smokers, and smokers.\nThis study analyzed the data for 4176 nonsmokers, 2406 former smokers, and 2056 smokers who were enrolled prospectively in the European Collaborators on Stent-Graft Techniques for Aortic Aneurysm Repair (EUROSTAR) database. Compared with nonsmokers, smokers required more percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placements during EVAR (P < .001), and stent graft migration occurred more often (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.05; P = .033). Nonsmokers had more late type II endoleaks than former smokers and smokers (58.5%, 55.9%, and 35.5%, respectively; P < .001). Smoking had no effect on aneurysm sac behavior or AAA neck growth after EVAR.\nSmokers need more percutaneous transluminal angioplasty procedures and stents during EVAR. They have fewer late type II endoleaks during follow-up; however, smokers should be closely monitored because they have an increased risk of stent graft migration.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the contribution of Aptus EndoStaples (Aptus Endosystems, Sunnyvale, Calif) in the proximal fixation of eight endografts used in the endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR).\nNine human cadaveric aortas were exposed, left in situ, and transected to serve as fixation zones. The Zenith (Cook, Bloomington, Ind), Anaconda (Vascutek, Inchinnan, Scotland, UK), Endurant (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn), Excluder (W. L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz), Aptus (Aptus Endosystems), Aorfix (Lombard Medical, Didcot, UK), Talent (Medtronic), and AneuRx (Medtronic) stent grafts were proximally deployed and caudal displacement force (DF) was applied via a force gauge, recording the DF required to dislocate each device \u226520 mm from the infrarenal neck. Measurements were repeated after four and six EndoStaples were applied at the proximal fixation zone, as well as after a Dacron graft was sutured at the proximal neck in standard fashion. Finally, a silicone tube was used as a control fixation zone to test the DF of grafts with EndoStaples in a material that exceeded the integrity of a typical human cadaveric aorta and provided a consistent substrate to examine the differential effect of variable degrees of EndoStaple implantation using zero, two, four, and six EndoStaples.\nIn the cadaveric model, the mean DF required to dislocate the endografts without the application of EndoStaples was 19.73 \u00b1 12.52 N; this increased to 49.72 \u00b1 12.53 N (P < .0001) when four EndoStaples where applied and to 79.77 \u00b1 28.04 N when six EndoStaples were applied (P = .003). The DF necessary to separate the conventionally hand-sutured Dacron graft from the aorta was 56 N. In the silicone tube model, the Aptus endograft without EndoStaples withstood 3.2 N of DF. The DF increased to 39 \u00b1 3 N when two EndoStaples were added, to 71 \u00b1 6 N when four were added, and to 98 \u00b1 5 N when six were added. In eight of the 13 cadaver experiments conducted with four and six EndoStaples, the displacement occurred as a result of complete aortic transection proximal to the fixation site, indicating that aortic tissue integrity was the limiting factor in these experiments.\nThe fixation of eight different endografts was increased by a mean of 30 N with four Aptus EndoStaples and by a mean of 57 N with six EndoStaples in this model. Endostaples can increase endograft fixation to levels equivalent or superior to that of a hand-sewn anastomosis. The application of six EndoStaples results in aortic tissue failure above the fixation zone, demonstrating fixation strength that exceeds inherent aortic integrity in these cadavers.",

    "abstract": "There has been an increasing awareness of the superiority of native arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) over prosthetic grafts for dialysis access. Many AVFs fail to mature, however, and others develop stenosis while in use. There is growing experience in treating these patients in the interventional suite with percutaneous balloon angioplasty. These procedures, however, are expensive, uncomfortable, and inconvenient for patients and physicians, and involve exposure to radiation and intravenous contrast in patients who are often not on dialysis. This study reviews our experience with ultrasound-guided angioplasty of AVFs in the office setting.\nA retrospective review was performed of all patients treated in our practice with ultrasound-guided AVF angioplasty, from May 2009 to April 2011. The need for intervention was determined by examination and duplex ultrasound. All patients referred to the practice with failing or nonmaturing AVFs were treated in the office under ultrasound guidance, unless a central venous stenosis was suspected. All procedures were performed with the patient under local anesthesia by a single surgeon, and preprocedure, periprocedure, and postprocedure ultrasounds were performed in a single vascular laboratory.\nThere were 31 AVFs in 30 patients in the study. Fifty-five interventions were performed, 48 for AVFs failing to mature and seven for stenosis in functioning AFVs. The 90-day patency was 93%. The overall complication rate was 11%. Two patients had proximal stenosis that could not be crossed (one patient required surgical revision and one patient refused further treatment and thrombosed). There were four perifistular hematomas; three of these resulted in AFV thrombosis. No patients required hospitalization or urgent surgical intervention. Eighty-five percent of patients treated for AVF failing to mature achieved a functional fistula.\nAVF intervention can be performed safely and effectively under ultrasound guidance in the office setting and is a valuable tool in the management of dialysis access patients.",

    "abstract": "The vascular endothelium plays a major role in the control of arterial tone; however, its role in venous tissues is less clear. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of endothelium in the control of venous function and the relaxation pathways involved.\nCircular segments of inferior vena cava (IVC) from male Sprague-Dawley rats were suspended between two wires and isometric contraction to phenylephrine (Phe; 10(-5)M) and 96 mM KCl was measured. Acetylcholine (Ach; 10(-10) to 10(-5)M) was added and the percentage of venous relaxation was measured. To determine the role of nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI(2)), vein relaxation was measured in the presence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(\u03c9)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 3 \u00d7 10(-4) M) and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10(-5) M). To measure the role of hyperpolarization, vein relaxation was measured in the presence of K(+) channel activator cromakalim (10(-11) to 10(-6) M), and the nonselective K(+) channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA; 10(-3) M). To test for the contribution of a specific K(+) channel, the effects of K(+) channel blockers: glibenclamide (adenosine triphosphate [ATP]-sensitive K(ATP), 10(-5) M), 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; voltage-dependent K(v), 10(-3) M), apamin (small conductance Ca(2+)-dependent SK(Ca), 10(-7) M), and iberiotoxin (large conductance Ca(2+)-dependent BK(Ca), 10(-8) M) on Ach-induced relaxation were tested.\nAch caused concentration-dependent relaxation of Phe contraction (maximum 49.9 \u00b1 4.9%). Removal of endothelium abolished Ach-induced relaxation. IVC treatment with L-NAME partially reduced Ach relaxation (32.8 \u00b1 4.9%). In IVC treated with L-NAME plus indomethacin, significant Ach-induced relaxation (33.6 \u00b1 3.2%) could still be observed, suggesting a role of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). In IVC treated with L-NAME, indomethacin and TEA, Ach relaxation was abolished, supporting a role of EDHF. In veins stimulated with high KCl, Ach caused relaxation (maximum 59.5 \u00b1 3.5%) that was abolished in the presence of L-NAME and indomethacin suggesting that any Ach-induced EDHF is blocked in the presence of high KCl depolarizing solution, which does not favor outward movement of K(+) ion and membrane hyperpolarization. Cromakalim, an activator of K(ATP), caused significant IVC relaxation when applied alone or on top of maximal Ach-induced relaxation, suggesting that the Ach response may not involve K(ATP). Ach-induced relaxation was not inhibited by glibenclamide, 4-AP, or apamin, suggesting little role of K(ATP), K(v) or SK(Ca), respectively. In contrast, iberiotoxin significantly inhibited Ach-induced relaxation, suggesting a role of BK(Ca).\nThus, endothelium-dependent venous relaxation plays a major role in the control of venous function. In addition to NO, an EDHF pathway involving BK(Ca) may play a role in endothelium-dependent venous relaxation.",

    "results": "Ach caused concentration-dependent relaxation of Phe contraction (maximum 49.9 \u00b1 4.9%). Removal of endothelium abolished Ach-induced relaxation. IVC treatment with L-NAME partially reduced Ach relaxation (32.8 \u00b1 4.9%). In IVC treated with L-NAME plus indomethacin, significant Ach-induced relaxation (33.6 \u00b1 3.2%) could still be observed, suggesting a role of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). In IVC treated with L-NAME, indomethacin and TEA, Ach relaxation was abolished, supporting a role of EDHF. In veins stimulated with high KCl, Ach caused relaxation (maximum 59.5 \u00b1 3.5%) that was abolished in the presence of L-NAME and indomethacin suggesting that any Ach-induced EDHF is blocked in the presence of high KCl depolarizing solution, which does not favor outward movement of K(+) ion and membrane hyperpolarization. Cromakalim, an activator of K(ATP), caused significant IVC relaxation when applied alone or on top of maximal Ach-induced relaxation, suggesting that the Ach response may not involve K(ATP). Ach-induced relaxation was not inhibited by glibenclamide, 4-AP, or apamin, suggesting little role of K(ATP), K(v) or SK(Ca), respectively. In contrast, iberiotoxin significantly inhibited Ach-induced relaxation, suggesting a role of BK(Ca).",

    "abstract": "This review was performed to analyze the current knowledge and controversies in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of pediatric venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared with adults.\nSearches of the MEDLINE database and manual searches of the references of selected articles were performed to select reports for their relevance and quality of information on the similarities and differences in pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in children and adults.\nSymptomatic VTE incidence is reported at a rate of 0.07 in every 10,000 children, which is significantly lower than the rate in adults. Pulmonary emboli in adolescents are rarely fatal, unlike in adults. VTE recurrence is also much lower in children. Young age has been shown to be protective of VTE, whereas central venous catheters are very important in pediatric venous thrombosis. The incidence of postthrombotic syndrome varies from 20% to 65%, with mild symptoms in most children. Cerebral and visceral vein thrombosis may lead to severe morbidity and death. Some factors of thrombophilia have a significant effect in the pediatric population; however, its overall significance is controversial. Most data on VTE treatment are extrapolated from studies in adults. Children with acute VTE should be treated with anticoagulation therapy. Treatment duration depends on the nature of the thrombosis and previous VTE events.\nThere is a paucity of prospective randomized studies with data determining not only the effect of VTE but also the treatment options in children. Thrombophilia is a risk factor for pediatric VTE, but its significance has not been thoroughly investigated. Guidelines specific to children for antithrombotic therapy, prophylaxis, and optimal duration need re-evaluation and support by strong evidence.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesized that the general inflammation observed in the wall of large, asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) could be detected in vivo by 18-fluorodeoxglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) and, if so, that this method could be used to study if active inflammation is an early pathogenetic finding in small AAAs detected by screening.\nIn this prospective clinical study, 12 men were examined with FDG-PET computed tomography. Seven had large asymptomatic AAAs (range, 52-66 mm) that required surgery, and five had small AAAs (range, 34-40 mm) under surveillance. In the surgery group, biopsy specimens were taken from the aneurysm wall for histologic examinations.\nCompared with normal segments of the aorta, liver, and blood and compared with healthy controls matched for age and sex, no increased FDG uptake, measured as standardized uptake value, was detected in any of the large or small AAAs. The SUV(mean) difference between infrarenal aorta and blood was -0.3 for cases and -0.1 for controls (P = .06). The corresponding differences between the infrarenal aorta and liver was -0.8 and -0.8 (P = .91) and between infrarenal aorta and suprarenal aorta was -0.2 and -0.1 for cases and controls, respectively (P = .20). The histologic examination of the aneurysm walls showed high inflammatory cell infiltration with T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and macrophages.\nThe chronic inflammation observed in the wall of asymptomatic AAAs was not sufficiently metabolically active to result in an increased glucose metabolism detectable by FDG-PET by means of this standard protocol. To study the importance of inflammation in the pathogenesis of AAAs in vivo, PET tracers other than FDG need to be developed.",

    "abstract": "The care of patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and tissue loss is notoriously challenging and expensive. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of various management strategies to identify those that would optimize value to patients.\nA probabilistic Markov model was used to create a detailed simulation of patient-oriented outcomes, including clinical events, wound healing, functional outcomes, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) after various management strategies in a CLI patient cohort during a 10-year period. Direct and indirect cost estimates for these strategies were obtained using transition cost-accounting methodology. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), in 2009 U.S. dollars per QALYs, were calculated compared with the most conservative management strategy of local wound care with amputation as needed.\nWith an ICER of $47,735/QALY, an initial surgical bypass with subsequent endovascular revision(s) as needed was the most cost-effective alternative to local wound care alone. Endovascular-first management strategies achieved comparable clinical outcomes but at higher cost (ICERs \u2265$101,702/QALY); however, endovascular management did become cost-effective when the initial foot wound closure rate was >37% or when procedural costs were decreased by >42%. Primary amputation was dominated (less effectiveness and more costly than wound care alone).\nContemporary clinical effectiveness and cost estimates show an initial surgical bypass is the most cost-effective alternative to local wound care alone for CLI with tissue loss and can be supported even in a cost-averse health care environment.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the vascular distribution of stroke after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and its relationship to perioperative death and neurologic outcome.\nA retrospective review was performed for patients undergoing TEVAR between 2001 and 2010. Aortic arch hybrid and abdominal debranching cases were excluded. Demographics, operative variables, and neurologic complications were examined. Stroke was defined as any new focal or global neurologic deficit lasting>24 hours with radiographic confirmation of acute intracranial pathology.\nPerioperative stroke occurred in 20 of 530 patients (3.8%) undergoing TEVAR. The cohort was 55% male and a mean age of 75.2\u00b18.9 years (range, 57-90 years). Among patients with perioperative strokes, the indication for surgery was degenerative aneurysm in 14 (mean diameter, 6.8 cm), acute type B dissection in four, penetrating atherosclerotic aneurysm in one, and aortic transection in one. Cases were performed urgently or as an emergency in 60%. The proximal landing zone was zone 2 in 11 or zone 3 in nine. All strokes were embolic. The vascular distribution of stroke involved the anterior cerebral (AC) circulation in eight (zone 2, n=5) and the posterior cerebral (PC) circulation in 12 (zone 2, n=6). Laterality of cerebral infarction included five right-sided, eight left-sided, and seven bilateral strokes. Nine strokes were diagnosed<24 hours after operation. There was no difference in baseline demographics, aortic pathology, acuity, zone coverage, preoperative left subclavian artery revascularization, number of stents, or estimated blood loss between stroke groups based on vascular distribution. Independent risk factors for any perioperative stroke were chronic renal insufficiency (odds ratios [OR], 4.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-17.7; P=.02) and history of prior stroke (OR, 4.92; 95% CI, 1.69-14.4; P=.004); the risk factor for AC stroke was prior stroke (OR, 7.67; 95% CI, 1.25-46.9; P=.03) and the risk factors for PC stroke were age (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00-1.23; P=.04), prior stroke (OR, 7.53; 95% CI, 1.78-31.8; P=.006), zone 2 coverage (OR, 6.11; 95% CI, 1.15-32.3; P=.03), and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (OR, 32.7; 95% CI, 1.33-807.2; P=.03). Overall in-hospital mortality was 20% (n=4), with those sustaining PC strokes observed to trend toward increased mortality (33% vs 0%; P=.12). Patients with AC strokes were more likely than those with PC strokes to achieve complete recovery of neurologic deficits before discharge (75% vs 17%; P=.02).\nPerioperative stroke after TEVAR is primarily an embolic event. Although infrequent, stroke was associated with significant morbidity and death, particularly among those with strokes involving the PC circulation.",

The vascular distribution of stroke involved the anterior cerebral (AC) circulation in eight (zone 2, n=5) and the posterior cerebral (PC) circulation in 12 (zone 2, n=6). Laterality of cerebral infarction included five right-sided, eight left-sided, and seven bilateral strokes. Nine strokes were diagnosed<24 hours after operation. There was no difference in baseline demographics, aortic pathology, acuity, zone coverage, preoperative left subclavian artery revascularization, number of stents, or estimated blood loss between stroke groups based on vascular distribution. Independent risk factors for any perioperative stroke were chronic renal insufficiency (odds ratios [OR], 4.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-17.7; P=.02) and history of prior stroke (OR, 4.92; 95% CI, 1.69-14.4; P=.004); the risk factor for AC stroke was prior stroke (OR, 7.67; 95% CI, 1.25-46.9; P=.03) and the risk factors for PC stroke were age (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00-1.23; P=.04), prior stroke (OR, 7.53; 95% CI, 1.78-31.8; P=.006), zone 2 coverage (OR, 6.11; 95% CI, 1.15-32.3; P=.03), and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (OR, 32.7; 95% CI, 1.33-807.2; P=.03). Overall in-hospital mortality was 20% (n=4), with those sustaining PC strokes observed to trend toward increased mortality (33% vs 0%; P=.12). Patients with AC strokes were more likely than those with PC strokes to achieve complete recovery of neurologic deficits before discharge (75% vs 17%; P=.02).",

    "abstract": "We wanted to examine whether brain computed tomography (CT) perfusion can help to detect the reconstitution of cerebral hemodynamics and predict intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) after carotid stenting.\nFrom September 2002 to October 2009, data of 114 patients with carotid intervention were prospectively collected, and we retrospectively identified a total of 108 consecutive patients with unilateral carotid stenting. Brain CT perfusion was studied at three time points: 1 week before, and 1 week and 6 months after stenting. Cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow, and time to peak (TTP) of brain CT perfusion were examined at cortical and subcortical areas of middle cerebral artery (MCA) and posterior cerebral artery territory. The CBV, cerebral blood flow, and TTP ratios of stenting side/nonstenting side were used for comparison. The flow direction of ophthalmic artery was detected by sonography, and the presence of anterior communicating artery was examined on prestenting cerebral angiogram.\nAfter carotid stenting, CBV and TTP ratios improved significantly in both MCA cortical and subcortical areas in patients with unilateral carotid stenosis (P < .01) but not in patients with bilateral carotid stenosis. Patients with reversed ophthalmic flow had better improvement of TTP in both MCA and posterior cerebral artery territories (P < .05) than patients with forward flow. However, no significant difference was found between patients with and patients without anterior communicating artery collateral (P > .05). The prestenting TTP ratio in MCA subcortical area was significantly higher in patients with poststenting ICH than patients without ICH (P = .0191).\nCerebral hemodynamics can be reconstituted within a few days after carotid revascularization, especially in patients with reversed ophthalmic flow. Prolonged TTP in prestenting MCA subcortical area may suggest a high risk of poststenting ICH.",

    "abstract": "A novel self-expanding, drug-eluting stent (DES) was designed to slowly release everolimus in order to prevent restenosis after percutaneous peripheral intervention. The purpose of this experimental animal study was to test the hypothesis that long-term local, stent-mediated delivery of everolimus would reduce neointimal hyperplasia in porcine iliac arteries.\nThe iliac arteries of 24 Yucatan mini-swine were percutaneously treated with overlapping 8- \u00d7 28-mm self-expanding nitinol stents loaded with everolimus (225 \u03bcg/cm2 stent surface area) formulated in a poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) copolymer intended to deliver the drug in a sustained fashion over about 6 months (DES). Bare nitinol self-expanding stents (bare metal stent [BMS]) were implanted in an identical fashion on the contralateral side to serve as controls. After 3, 6, or 12 months, the animals were sacrificed and the stented arteries perfusion-fixed for histomorphometric analysis.\nThe chronic presence of everolimus in arterial tissue reduced stent-induced inflammation after 3 months (inflammation score: BMS 2.29\u00b10.44 vs DES 0.17\u00b10.17; P=.001) and 6 months (BMS 2.06\u00b10.43 vs DES 0.50\u00b10.5; P=.007), although some late inflammation was observed after drug exhaustion (BMS 1.00\u00b10.25 vs DES 2.56\u00b10.62 after 12 months; P=not significant [NS]). Treatment with locally delivered everolimus significantly reduced neointimal hyperplasia after 3 months (neointimal thickness: BMS 0.79\u00b10.20 vs DES 0.37\u00b10.04 mm; P=.03) and 6 months (BMS 0.73\u00b10.14 vs DES 0.41\u00b10.08 mm; P=.05), although the effect had dissipated after 12 months (BMS 0.68\u00b10.11 vs DES 0.67\u00b10.11 mm; P=NS). Remarkably, stent-induced neoatherosclerosis, characterized by the histologic presence of foamy macrophages and cholesterol clefts, was significantly attenuated by treatment with everolimus (atherogenic change scores at 3 months: BMS 0.56\u00b10.15 vs DES 0.04\u00b10.04; P=.003; 6 months: BMS 0.84\u00b10.23 vs DES 0.00\u00b10.00; P=.004; and 12 months: BMS 0.09\u00b10.10 vs DES 0.19\u00b10.19; P=NS).\nIn this experimental animal model, local arterial stent-mediated delivery of everolimus inhibited the formation of neointimal hyperplasia and neoatherosclerosis during the first 6 months. The effect was transient, however, as arterial morphology and histology appeared similar to control stented arteries after 12 months.",

    "abstract": "Contralateral carotid artery occlusion by itself carries an increased risk of stroke. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the presence of contralateral carotid artery occlusion has high reported rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Our objective was to determine if there is a clinical benefit to patients who receive carotid artery stenting (CAS) compared to CEA in the presence of contralateral carotid artery occlusion.\nWe conducted a retrospective medical chart review over a 4.5-year institutional experience of persons with contralateral carotid artery occlusion and ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis who underwent CAS or CEA. The main outcome measures were 30-day cardiac, stroke, and mortality rate, and midterm mortality.\nOf a total of 713 patients treated for carotid artery stenosis during this time period, 57 had contralateral occlusion (~8%). Thirty-nine of these patients were treated with CAS, and 18 with CEA. The most common indications for CAS were prior neck surgery (18), contralateral internal carotid occlusion (nine), and prior neck radiation (seven). The average age was 70 \u00b1 8.5 for CEA and 66.7 \u00b1 9.3 for CAS (P = .20). Both groups were predominantly men (CEA 12 of 18; CAS 28 of 39; P = .76), with similar prevalence of symptomatic lesions (CEA 8 of 18, CAS 20 of 39; P = .77). Two patients died within 30 days in the CAS group (5%). No deaths occurred within 30 days in the CEA group (P = .50); the mortality rate for CAS and CEA combined was 3.5%. No perioperative strokes or myocardial infarction occurred in either group. Two transient ischemic attacks occurred after CAS. At mean follow-up of 29.4 \u00b1 16 months (CEA) and 28 \u00b1 14.4 months (CAS; range, 1.5-48.5 months), seven deaths occurred in the CAS group and one in the CEA group (17.9% vs 5.5%; P = .40). There were two reinterventions in the CAS group for in-stent restenosis and there were no reoperations in the CEA group.\nAlthough CEA and CAS can both be performed with good perioperative results and acceptable midterm mortality, the observed outcomes do not support use of contralateral carotid artery occlusion as a selection criterion for CAS over CEA in the absence of other indications.",

    "abstract": "Vascular malformations are uncommon but may confer significant morbidity. Limitations in diagnosis and treatment result from inadequate classification schema and diagnostic algorithms. The crucial distinction is between high-flow and low-flow lesions because this informs prognosis and treatment. This study assessed the utility of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (dceMRI) in distinguishing high-flow from low-flow lesions, a technique that has previously not been widely applied or evaluated in this patient population.\nA prospective database of all patients referred to the multidisciplinary vascular malformation team at our institution was reviewed from January 2006 to June 2010. dceMRI was obtained on each patient to determine flow characteristics and lesion extent. Additional studies were used as indicated. Catheter-based arteriography was performed when high-flow lesions were identified with the intention of intervening or to distinguish between high-flow and low-flow lesions when MRI was indeterminate. A triage algorithm was used to stratify patients and formulate therapeutic goals. We analyzed the accuracy of dceMRI in identifying high-flow and low-flow lesions.\nThe study included 122 patients (aged <1 to 70 years) comprising 52 males (42.6%) and 70 females (57.4%). Pain (72 patients; 59%) and swelling (88 patients; 72.1%) were the most common presenting symptoms. All patients underwent dceMRI. Of these, 68 had confirmatory imaging (n = 15) or intervention (n = 53). The dceMRI was able to definitively and correctly distinguish high-flow from low-flow lesions in 57 studies, for an accuracy rate of 83.8%. In the remaining 11 studies, dceMRI correctly queried flow status but not definitively, and confirmatory angiography was required.\nUsing a diagnostic tool designed to identify key clinical characteristics, we were able to successfully distinguish between high-flow and low-flow vascular malformations using dceMRI alone in 83.8% of patients, minimizing the need for unnecessary invasive catheter-based procedures.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is known to have a survival benefit over open repair in patients with descending thoracic aneurysms and has become a mainstay of therapy. Because death before 1 year after TEVAR likely indicates an ineffective therapy, we have created a predictive model for death within 1 year using factors available in the preoperative setting.\nA registry of 526 TEVARs performed at the University of Florida between September 2000 and November 2010 was queried for patients with degenerative descending thoracic aneurysm as their primary pathology. Procedures with emergent or urgent indications were excluded. Preoperatively available variables, such as baseline comorbidities, anatomic-, and procedure-specific planning details, were recorded. Univariate predictors of death were analyzed with multivariable Cox proportional hazards to identify independent predictors of 30-day (death within 30 days) and 1-year mortality (death within 1 year) after TEVAR.\nA total of 224 patients were identified and evaluated. The 30-day mortality rate was 3% (n = 7) and the 1-year mortality rate was 15% (n = 33). Multivariable predictors of 1-year mortality (hazard ratios [95% confidence interval]) included: age >70 years (5.8 [2.1-16.0]; P = .001), adjunctive intraoperative procedures (eg, brachiocephalic or visceral stents, or both, concomitant arch debranching procedures; 4.5 [1.9-10.8]; P = .001), peripheral arterial disease (3.0 [1.4-6.7]; P = .006), coronary artery disease (2.4 [1.1-4.9]; P = .02), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.9 [1.0-3.9]; P = .06). A diagnosis of hyperlipidemia was protective (0.4 [0.2-0.7]; P = .006). When patients were grouped into those with one, two, three, or four or more of these risk factors, the predicted 1-year mortality was 1%, 3%, 10%, 27%, and 54%, respectively.\nFactors are available in the preoperative setting that are predictive of death within 1 year after TEVAR and can guide clinical decision making regarding the timing of repair. Patients with multiple risk factors, such as age \u2265 70 years, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a need for an extensive procedure involving adjunctive therapies, have a high predicted mortality within 1 year and may be best served by waiting for a larger aneurysm size to justify the risk of intervention.",

    "abstract": "Successful catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) for iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (IFDVT) reduces post-thrombotic morbidity and is a suggested treatment option by the American College of Chest Physicians for patients with IFDVT. Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (PMT) is also suggested to shorten treatment time and reduce the dose of plasminogen activator. However, concern remains that mechanical devices might damage vein valves. The purpose of this study is to examine whether PMT adversely affects venous valve function compared to CDT alone in IFDVT patients treated with catheter-based techniques.\nSixty-nine limbs in 54 patients (39 unilateral, 15 bilateral) who underwent catheter-based treatment for IFDVT form the basis of this study. Lytic success and degree of residual obstruction were analyzed by reviewing postprocedural phlebograms. All patients underwent bilateral postprocedure duplex to evaluate patency and valve function. Phlebograms and venous duplex examinations were interpreted in a blinded fashion. Limbs were analyzed based on the method of treatment: CDT alone (n = 20), PMT using rheolytic thrombolysis (n = 14), and isolated pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (n = 35). The validated outcome measures were compared between the treatment groups.\nSixty-nine limbs underwent CDT with or without PMT. The average patient age was 47 years (range, 16-78). Venous duplex was performed 44.4 months (mean) post-treatment. Of the limbs treated with CDT with drip technique, 65% demonstrated reflux vs 53% treated with PMT (P = .42). There was no difference in long-term valve function between patients treated with rheolytic and isolated pharmacomechanical thrombolysis. In the bilateral group, 87% (13/15) demonstrated reflux in at least one limb. In the unilateral group, 64% (25/39) had reflux in their treated limb and 36% (14/39) in their contralateral limb. There was no correlation effect of residual venous obstruction on valve function, although few patients had >50% residual obstruction.\nIn patients undergoing catheter-based intervention for IFDVT, PMT does not adversely affect valve function compared with CDT alone. A higher than expected number of patients had reflux in their uninvolved limb.",

    "abstract": "Anatomic factors may limit the application of stent grafts for the treatment of arterial aneurysms. Flow- diverting stents (FDSs) are specially designed to reduce flow velocity in the aneurysm sac and promote thrombosis while maintaining flow in the main artery and branch vessels. FDSs include the Pipeline Embolization Device (ev3, Plymouth, Minn), the SILK Arterial Reconstruction Device (Balt Extrusion, Montmorency, France), and the Cardiatis Multilayer Stent (Cardiatis, Isnes, Belgium). The first two have been mainly used for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. The aim of this study was to review the current role of FDSs in the treatment of extracranial arterial aneurysms.\nA systematic electronic health database search was conducted using PubMed, Ovid, Medline, and the Cochrane Database on all accessible published articles through March 2012. An additional search for abstracts presented in international congresses for vascular surgery was also performed. Full-text articles and abstracts were analyzed separately due to the heterogeneity of the data.\nResults of the use of FDSs in arterial aneurysms were reported in 12 full-text articles including 35 patients (26 men, age 65.4) with 38 aneurysms. The aneurysms were located in the hepatic (n = 12), splenic (n = 6), renal (n = 5), celiac (n = 4), superior mesenteric (n = 3), subclavian (n = 2), gastroduodenal (n = 1), and popliteal arteries (n = 1) and in the descending thoracic (n = 1), suprarenal (n = 1) and infrarenal aorta (n = 2). The 30-day mortality was 5.7% (2 of 35 patients). Three stent thromboses occurred (8.3%), none of them with clinical consequences. Thirty patients with 33 aneurysms and patent FDSs were monitored for an average of 9.2 months. Thrombosis occurred in 90.6%, and volume reduction was observed in 81% of the aneurysms. No branch vessel occlusion occurred. Twelve abstracts were identified, including 133 patients (mean age, 64.7 years). They included 62 peripheral, 28 visceral, and 43 abdominal and thoracoabdominal aneurysms. The Cardiatis Multilayer Stent was used in all cases. Thrombosis was achieved in all but two peripheral and visceral aneurysms. Volume reduction was observed in 82.7%, and no branch vessel occlusion occurred. In aortic aneurysms, better results regarding aneurysm thrombosis, reduction of the volume, and patency of collateral branches were reported at 12 months rather than at 6 months postoperatively. No aneurysm rupture has yet been described.\nInitial clinical experience with the use of FDSs in the treatment of visceral and peripheral aneurysms yielded satisfactory results in technical success, aneurysm thrombosis and shrinkage, and in patency of branch vessels. The results in aortic aneurysms are still under investigation. No aneurysm rupture has yet been described. There is a significant incidence of FDS thrombosis. Volume reduction of the aneurysm is a clearer evidence of the clinical success after treatment with FDSs than aneurysm thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the remodeling of proximal neck (PN) angulations of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nA 64-row multidetector computed tomography scan of AAAs treated with EVAR was reviewed, and the PN angulation was measured on a volume-rendered three-dimensional image. The computed tomography scan was examined preoperatively, after EVAR at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years, 2 years, and then yearly. The study enrolled 78 patients, comprising 54 Zenith devices (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) and 24 Excluder devices (W. L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz).\nPN angulation was 50\u00b0 \u00b1 20\u00b0 preoperatively, and after EVAR was 36\u00b0 \u00b1 14\u00b0 at 1 week, 32\u00b0 \u00b1 14\u00b0 at 1 year, and 28\u00b0 \u00b1 13\u00b0 at 3 years. PN angulations \u2264 60\u00b0 (n = 70, 77%) were 41\u00b0 \u00b1 13\u00b0 preoperatively, 31\u00b0 \u00b1 12\u00b0 1 week after EVAR, 28\u00b0 \u00b1 12\u00b0 at 1 year, and 26\u00b0 \u00b1 13\u00b0 after 3 years. An angulation >60\u00b0 (n = 18, 23%) was 78\u00b0 \u00b1 14\u00b0 preoperatively, 51\u00b0 \u00b1 11\u00b0 1 week after EVAR, 44\u00b0 \u00b1 11\u00b0 at 1 year, and 40\u00b0 \u00b1 12\u00b0 after 3 years. The greater the preoperative PN angulation, the greater its reduction immediately after EVAR (r = .72, P < .001). The diameter shrinkage of AAAs with a PN angulation >60\u00b0 was 3 \u00b1 6 mm after 1 year; a significantly smaller shrinkage than with a PN angulation \u2264 60\u00b0 (7 \u00b1 7 mm, P < .05). AAAs with a PN angulation >60\u00b0 had a larger angulation reduction and a smaller diameter shrinkage after the EVAR procedure. The PN angulation of the 54 AAAs treated by Zenith was 49\u00b0 \u00b1 22\u00b0 preoperatively, 34\u00b0 \u00b1 14\u00b0 1 week after EVAR, and 25\u00b0 \u00b1 13\u00b0 after 3 years. The corresponding angulation of the 24 AAAs treated by Excluder devices was 52\u00b0 \u00b1 17\u00b0, 41\u00b0 \u00b1 14\u00b0, and 38\u00b0 \u00b1 9\u00b0, respectively. The PN angulation reduction of Zenith and Excluder was similar 1 week after the EVAR procedure. Unlike Excluder, however, the PN angulation in Zenith continued to reduce for a long period at a slow pace. There were no significant correlations between PN angulation reduction and diameter change and between PN length and diameter change (P = .86 and .18, respectively).\nAlthough the instructions for use of most commercially available stent grafts provide for a PN angulation of \u2264 60\u00b0, PN angulation was not a major issue in a midterm follow-up of AAAs with adequate PN length for patients in this series who received a Zenith or Excluder graft.",

    "abstract": "Simulation technology has a well-defined role in nonmedical professions such as aviation and over the last two decades has permeated medical training. The most successful surgical simulation is in the fields of laparoscopic and endovascular surgery. These two-dimensional scenarios, as in the aviation industry, lend themselves to simulation. Open simulators have been met with more resistance than their laparoscopic counterparts because of the difficulties in simulating the three-dimensional field. Engaging in persistent practice is what makes the expert and all trainees should aspire to this. Without knowing, all surgical trainees have engaged in deliberate practice when first learning to tie surgical knots. This deliberate practice should be used in all aspects of vascular surgical practice, and it is no longer acceptable to perform procedures such as arterial anastomoses for the first time on patients. Simulators exist for all aspects of vascular surgical training and vary in complexity and price. Some of these simulators are suitable for use at home or in a skills laboratory whereas others are more suitable for use in a specialized skills center. Training on these simulators can be offered at a local level or at a regional level in the skills center. Where surgical procedures are not commonly performed or expertise is required for a new innovation, it is more appropriate to have national or internationally based workshops under the auspices of surgical boards or societies. Simulation of crisis management, well known in aviation, has also been applied to vascular surgical practice and can offer benefit to senior trainees even when their performance on a noncrisis simulator has reached a plateau. This article identifies the areas where simulation in open vascular surgery can benefit the trainee.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the safety and effectiveness of the infrainguinal use of the AngioJet rheolytic mechanical thrombectomy system (Possis Medical, Minneapolis, Minn) for the treatment of acute infrainguinal thromboembolism occurring during lower limb revascularization procedures.\nFor the interval between January 2000 and January 2011, our hospital's database was meticulously searched for all patients with acute thromboembolism that occurred during lower limb angioplasty, with or without stenting procedures, who were treated with infrainguinal AngioJet thrombectomy. Baseline patient demographics and procedural details were analyzed. Primary end points included technical success, defined as the complete revascularization of the acutely occluded vessel; clinical success, defined as the absence of death or amputation \u2264 60 days; and procedure-related complication. Secondary end points included embolized vessel primary patency and overall patient survival.\nDuring this 12-year period, 3147 peripheral percutaneous procedures of angioplasty, with or without stenting, were performed in our department. Intraoperative, clinically, and angiographically evident thromboembolism occurred in 18 of 3147 procedures (0.57%), and 14 (77.7%) were managed using the AngioJet thrombectomy system. In total, 22 arteries were treated (13 infrapopliteal, 3 femoropopliteal, and 6 popliteal arteries). All patients had a completion angiogram for the assessment of the runoff vessels' status. Technical and clinical success occurred in 13 of 14 (92.8%). Adjunctive local thrombolysis or clot trapping, or both, with stenting was used in 64.3% and 42.8% of the procedures, respectively. Mean time follow-up was 38.1 \u00b1 49.0 months. The 1-year embolized vessel primary patency rate was 50.9%, and the survival rate was 53.5% up to 11.5 years of follow-up, as estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The 1-year limb salvage rate was 92.3%. There were no procedure-related minor amputations and one (7.1%) procedure-related major above-knee amputation.\nThe use of AngioJet rheolytic thrombectomy and adjunctive local thrombolysis or stenting, or both, under filter protection, is safe and effective for the management of severe thromboembolic complications occurring in the femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal arteries during peripheral endovascular procedures.",

    "abstract": "Several clinical trials are currently evaluating stem cell therapy for patients with critical limb ischemia that have no other surgical or endovascular options for revascularization. However, these trials are conducted with different protocols, including use of different stem cell populations and different injection protocols, providing little means to compare trials and guide therapy. Accordingly, we developed a murine model of severe ischemia to allow methodic testing of relevant clinical parameters.\nHigh femoral artery ligation and total excision of the superficial femoral artery was performed on C57BL/6 mice. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated from the bone marrow of donor mice, characterized using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and injected (5\u00d710(5) to 2\u00d710(6)) into the semimembranosus (proximal) or gastrocnemius (distal) muscle. Vascular and functional outcomes were measured using invasive Doppler imaging, laser Doppler perfusion imaging, and the Tarlov and ischemia scores. Histologic analysis included quantification of muscle fiber area and number as well as capillary density.\nBlood flow and functional outcomes were improved in MNC-treated mice compared with controls over 28 days (flow: P<.0001; Tarlov: P=.0004; ischemia score: P=.0002). MNC-treated mice also showed greater gastrocnemius fiber area (P=.0053) and increased capillary density (P=.0004). Dose-response analysis showed increased angiogenesis and gastrocnemius fiber area but no changes in macroscopic vascular flow or functional scores. Overall functional outcomes in mice injected proximally to the ischemic area were similar to mice injected more distally, but muscle flow, capillary density, and gastrocnemius fiber area were increased (P<.05).\nHigh femoral ligation with complete excision of the superficial femoral artery is a reliable model of severe hind limb ischemia in C57BL/6 mice that shows a response to MNC treatment for functional and vascular outcomes. A dose response to the injection of MNCs appears to be present, at least microscopically, suggesting that an optimal cell number for stem cell therapy exists and that preclinical testing needs to be performed to optimally guide human trials. Injection of MNCs proximal to the site of ischemia may provide different outcomes compared with distal injection and warrants additional study.",

    "abstract": "Repair of patients with extent I and II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, whereas repair of more distal extent III and IV TAAAs has a lower risk of paraplegia and death. Therefore, we describe an approach using thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) as the index operation to convert extent I and II TAAAs to extent III and IV TAAAs amenable to subsequent open aortic repair to minimize patient risk.\nBetween July 2007 and March 2012, 10 staged hybrid operations were performed to treat one extent I and nine extent II TAAAs. Aortic aneurysm pathology included five chronic type B dissections, three acute type B dissections, and two penetrating aortic ulcers. Initially, the proximal descending thoracic aorta was repaired with TEVAR for coverage of the most proximal fenestration or penetrating ulcer, with seven elective and three emergent repairs. Interval open distal aortic replacement was performed in a short-term planned setting or for progressive dilation of the distal aortic segment. In the open repair, the proximal end of the graft was sewn directly to the distal end of the TEVAR and outer wall of the aorta.\nAverage patient age was 48 years, and 60% were men. Risk factors included hypertension (80%), current tobacco use (50%), and Marfan syndrome (30%). Complications after TEVAR included type IA (n=1) and type II (n=3) endoleaks, pleural effusions (n=3), and acute kidney injury (n=1). Three patients required endovascular reinterventions. In patients with dissection, persistent filling of the false lumen was common and associated with distal thoracic aortic dilation. Complications of open repair included acute kidney injury in two patients, but no cardiac, pulmonary, or neurologic morbidity. Median time between TEVAR and open repair was 14 weeks. Most importantly, no deaths or neurologic deficits occurred after either procedure during a median follow-up of 35 weeks.\nA staged hybrid approach to extensive TAAAs combining proximal TEVAR, followed by interval open distal TAAA repair, is safe and appears to be an effective alternative to traditional open repair. This approach may decrease the significant morbidity associated with single-stage open extent I and II TAAA repairs and may be applicable to multiple TAAA etiologies.",

The Valiant stent graft is an evolution of the Talent thoracic stent graft (Medtronic Vascular).\nThe VALOR II (Evaluation of the Clinical Performance of the Valiant Thoracic Stent Graft System in the Treatment of Descending Thoracic Aneurysms of Degenerative Etiology in Subjects Who Are Candidates for Endovascular Repair) was a prospective, nonrandomized, pivotal trial conducted at 24 U.S. sites with enrollment between December 2006 and September 2009. Standard follow-up examinations, including physical examination, computed tomography, and chest radiography, were at 1, 6, and 12 months, and annually through 5 years. VALOR II outcomes were compared with those from the pivotal VALOR (Evaluation of the Medtronic Vascular Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System for the Treatment of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms) trial of the Talent stent graft, which enrolled 195 patients with similar enrollment criteria.\nVALOR II enrolled 160 patients. Compared with VALOR patients, VALOR II patients had similar age and sex distribution but higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors and significantly more severe modified Society for Vascular Surgery/American Association for Vascular Surgery risk scores. Stent graft delivery and deployment were successful in 154 patients (96.3%). Outcomes at 30 days in VALOR II were perioperative mortality, 3.1%; major adverse events, 38.1%; paraplegia, 0.6%; paraparesis, 1.9%; and stroke, 2.5%. At 12 months, after the minimum sample size was reached, 151 patients were evaluated: aneurysm-related mortality was 4.0%, stent graft migration was 2.9%, and endoleak was 13.0%. Through 12 months, there were no ruptures, conversions to open surgery, secondary procedures due to endoleak >30 days, or loss of stent graft patency. The Valiant stent graft was statistically noninferior to the Talent stent graft in 12-month all-cause mortality (12.6% vs 16.1%) and exceeded the primary effectiveness goal of 12-month successful aneurysm treatment, defined as absence of aneurysm growth >5 mm and of secondary procedures for type I/III endoleak (97.4% vs 80.0%).\nThe VALOR II 12-month results demonstrate that the Medtronic Valiant thoracic stent graft is a safe and effective treatment for patients with descending thoracic aortic aneurysms of degenerative etiology.",

    "abstract": "Despite surgical adjuncts, paralysis remains a devastating complication after thoracoabdominal aortic interventions. Dexmedetomidine, a selective \u03b1-2a agonist commonly used for sedation in the critical care setting, has been shown to have protective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injuries in multiple organ systems. We hypothesized that treatment with dexmedetomidine would attenuate spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury via \u03b1-2a receptor activation.\nAdult C57BL/6 mice underwent sternotomy, followed by occlusion of the aortic arch for 4 minutes. Eight experimental mice received pretreatment with intraperitoneal dexmedetomidine (25 \u03bcg/kg) and at 12-hour intervals after reperfusion. Eight control mice received an equivalent amount of 0.9% normal saline. Five mice underwent the same procedure with dexmedetomidine (25 \u03bcg/kg) and atipamezole (250 \u03bcg/kg), an \u03b1-2a receptor antagonist. Functional analysis of the mice was obtained at 12-hour intervals and scored using the Basso Mouse Scale for Locomotion until 60 hours. All mice were euthanized at 60 hours. Their spinal cords were removed en bloc and were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to assess cytoarchitecture and neuronal viability.\nMice treated with the \u03b1-2a agonist demonstrated preserved motor function compared with ischemic controls and with mice treated with the \u03b1-2a antagonist in addition to the agonist. Functional differences in the dexmedetomidine group were statistically significant from 24 hours through the remainder of the experiment (P < .05). In addition, the treated mice had preserved cytoarchitecture, decreased vacuolization, and improved neuronal viability compared with ischemic control mice and mice concurrently treated with atipamezole, the dexmedetomidine \u03b1-2a antagonist.\nTreatment of mice with the \u03b1-2a agonist dexmedetomidine preserves motor function and neuronal viability after aortic cross-clamping. In addition, mice exhibited almost complete reversal of the protective effect with the administration of the \u03b1-2a receptor antagonist atipamezole. Dexmedetomidine appears to attenuate spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury via \u03b1-2a receptor-mediated agonism.\nThere remains a significant risk of paraplegia after thoracoabdominal aortic interventions. This complication is devastating to the patient and the health care system. Pharmacologic adjuncts to further decrease this complication have been studied; however, few viable options exist. The \u03b1-2a agonists have been shown to improve outcomes after strokes but have not been studied in spinal cord ischemia. We show that dexmedetomidine, a commonly used \u03b1-2a agonist in the operating room, can preserve neurologic function in mice after aortic cross-clamping. Although the protective mechanism of dexmedetomidine remains unknown, it might prove to be beneficial in reducing the incidence of paraplegia after aortic interventions.",

To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of penetration of the native aorta by a suprarenal stent in the absence of infection or trauma.",

    "abstract": "In addition to increased risks for aneurysm-related death, previous studies have determined that all-cause mortality in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients is excessive and equivalent to that associated with coronary heart disease. These studies largely preceded the current era of coronary heart disease risk factor management, however, and no recent study has examined contemporary mortality associated with early AAA disease (aneurysm diameter between 3 and 5 cm). As part of an ongoing natural history study of AAA, we report the mortality risk associated with presence of early disease.\nParticipants were recruited from three distinct health care systems in Northern California between 2006 and 2011. Aneurysm diameter, demographic information, comorbidities, medication history, and plasma for biomarker analysis were collected at study entry. Survival status was determined at follow-up. Data were analyzed with t-tests or \u03c7(2) tests where appropriate. Freedom from death was calculated via Cox proportional hazards modeling; the relevance of individual predictors on mortality was determined by log-rank test.\nThe study enrolled 634 AAA patients; age 76.4 \u00b1 8.0 years, aortic diameter 3.86 \u00b1 0.7 cm. Participants were mostly male (88.8%), not current smokers (81.6%), and taking statins (76.7%). Mean follow-up was 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 years. Estimated 1- and 3-year survival was 98.2% and 90.9%, respectively. Factors independently associated with mortality included larger aneurysm size (hazard ratio, 2.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-3.57 for diameter >4.0 cm) and diabetes (hazard ratio, 2.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-4.47). After adjusting for patient-level factors, health care system independently predicted mortality.\nContemporary all-cause mortality for patients with early AAA disease is lower than that previously reported. Further research is warranted to determine important factors that contribute to improved survival in early AAA disease.",

    "abstract": "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a quality measure recorded by initiatives such as the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). However, because surveillance-detected DVT rates may be higher than symptomatic DVT rates, we examined how differences in the method of DVT detection may affect the use of this quality measure.\nUsing the NSQIP database (2007-2009), we compared DVT rates of vascular (amputation, open aortic procedures, and lower extremity bypass) and nonvascular (prostatectomy, gastric bypass [GBP], and hip arthroplasty) operations. Using a predefined literature search strategy, we compared the incidence of DVT in NSQIP to the incidence of DVT reported in published literature, diagnosed by symptomatic status or by surveillance studies.\nWithin NSQIP, the overall incidence of postoperative DVT was 0.7%. This varied from 0.3% after GBP to 1.8% after open aortic surgery. Across all procedures except amputation, the incidence of DVT in NSQIP was similar to the incidence of DVT reported in our literature survey of \"symptomatic\" DVTs. The relative rate (RR) of literature-derived symptomatic DVTs to NSQIP ranged from 0.7 for aortic cases (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3-1.7) to 1.4 (95% CI, .7-3.1) for GBP. Overall, surveillance studies had 11.6 higher RR of DVT compared to NSQIP (95% CI, 10.5-13), ranging from 2.6 for GBP (95% CI, 1.4-5) to 14 .5 for hip arthroplasty (95% CI, 10.5-20).\nThe incidence of DVT reported in NSQIP is similar to the reported incidence of symptomatic DVT for many high-risk procedures but is much lower than rates of DVT reported in surveillance studies. Clear delineation of symptomatic vs surveillance detection of DVT would improve the usefulness of this measurement in quality improvement registries.",

    "abstract": "The effect of diabetes type (noninsulin dependent vs insulin dependent) on outcomes after lower-extremity bypass (LEB) has not been clearly defined. Therefore, we analyzed associations between diabetes type and outcomes after LEB in patients with critical limb ischemia.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of 1977 infrainguinal LEB operations done for critical limb ischemia between 2003 and 2010 within the Vascular Study Group of New England. Patients were categorized as nondiabetic (ND), noninsulin-dependent diabetic (NIDD), or insulin-dependent diabetic (IDD) based on their preoperative medication regimen. Our main outcome measures were in-hospital mortality and major adverse events (MAEs)--a composite outcome, including myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, congestive heart failure, wound infection, renal insufficiency, and major amputation. We compared crude and adjusted rates of mortality and MAEs using logistic regression across diabetes categories.\nOverall, 41% of patients were ND, 28% were NIDD, and 31% were IDD. Crude rates of in-hospital mortality were similar across these groups (1.7% vs 3.1% vs 2.1%; P = .211). Adjusted analyses accounting for differences in patient characteristics showed that diabetes is not associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality. However, type of diabetes was associated with a higher risk of MAEs in both crude (15.1% for ND; 21.1% for NIDD; and 25.2% for IDD; P < .001) and adjusted analyses (odds ratio for NIDD, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-1.7; odds ratio for IDD, 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-1.8).\nDiabetes is a significant contributor to the risk of postoperative complications after LEB surgery, and insulin dependence is associated with higher risk. Quality measures aimed at limiting complications after LEB may have the most impact if these initiatives are focused on patients who are IDD.",

Malformation of the inferior vena cava (IVC), although rare and frequently asymptomatic, may also result in left renal vein hypertension, with resultant hematuria when it is severely compressed. We report a 20-year-old man with persistent hematuria due to compression of left-sided IVC. The patient was successfully treated by means of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) transposition and division of the fibrous bundle at the origin of the SMA. His postoperative course was uneventful. Compression of the left IVC is a unique form of nutcracker syndrome. SMA transposition, together with division of a fibrous bundle at the origin of the SMA if present, is a safe and effective surgical procedure for this special entity.",

    "abstract": "Giant intracranial artery aneurysms (GIAAs) are often not amenable to neurosurgical clipping or endovascular coiling. Extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass, a procedure that has been essentially abandoned for the treatment of intracranial ischemic disease, followed by parent vessel occlusion, is often successful in treating these aneurysms. Vascular surgeons should be familiar with this operation, especially in centers with neurosurgical capability.\nA retrospective review of patients treated from 1990 to 2010 at New York University Medical Center was performed. Office and hospital records of all patients identified were reviewed with attention to the age and sex of the patient, presenting symptoms, preoperative testing, procedure performed, type of bypass conduit, graft patency, intraoperative and postoperative complications, length of follow-up, and overall outcome. EC-IC bypass was performed using a graft of great saphenous vein (GSV) or radial artery (RA). The vascular surgeon harvested the vascular conduit, tunneled the graft, and performed the extracranial anastomosis, and the intracranial anastomosis was performed by the neurosurgeon.\nA total of 36 patients (14 men, 22 women) underwent 37 EC-IC bypasses with 34 GSV and three RA grafts. The median age was 57 years (interquartile range, 49-66 years), and the median follow-up was 53 months (interquartile range, 29-77 months). Aneurysm location was the internal carotid artery in 30 patients, the basilar artery in three, and the middle cerebral artery in four. All 37 aneurysms were excluded from the cerebral circulation, with 33 grafts remaining patent at follow-up, as determined by serial cerebral or magnetic resonance angiogram. At follow-up, 33 of 34 of the GSV grafts (88%) and three of three (100%) of the RA grafts were patent. There were two deaths (5.6%), despite patent grafts. Postoperative graft occlusion led to homonymous hemianopsia in one patient and temporary hemiparesis in another (5.6%). Graft occlusions were asymptomatic in two patients.\nEC-IC bypass is a safe and effective treatment for GIAAs, with acceptable rates of morbidity (5.6%), mortality (5.6%), and graft patency (89.2%). We suggest that the technique described in this report should be routinely used for treatment of GIAAs in centers where neurosurgery and vascular surgery services are available and should be considered a standard procedure in the armamentarium of the vascular surgeon.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of head and neck malignancy commonly involves radiotherapy, which is associated with the development of carotid artery stenosis. There is little evidence to guide clinicians on how to intervene in significant postradiotherapy carotid stenosis. This systematic review collated data pertaining to perioperative outcomes of carotid artery surgery and carotid stenting in postradiotherapy carotid stenosis to aid the clinical decision-making process.\nA systematic review of the literature, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009 guidelines, was performed. We screened 575 articles related to carotid artery surgery or stenting in postradiotherapy carotid stenosis, from which 21 studies were included for quantitative analysis. The primary outcome was stroke or death \u2264 30 days of the procedure. Secondary outcomes included cranial nerve injury, restenosis, stroke, and death at >30 days.\nNine publications recorded 211 surgical procedures in 179 patients. In symptomatic patients, the 30-day mortality rate was 2.6% and the stroke or death rate was 2.7%. In asymptomatic patients, the 30-day mortality rate was 0% and the stroke or death rate was 1.1%. Permanent cranial nerve palsy was experienced by 0.6% of patients. Twelve publications recorded 510 carotid artery stenting procedures in 482 patients. In symptomatic patients, the 30-day mortality rate was 5.1%, and the stroke or death rate was 5.1%. In asymptomatic patients, the 30-day mortality rate was 1.4%, and the stroke or death rate was 2.1%. There was no statistically significant difference in 30-day stroke or death rate between surgical revascularization and carotid artery stenting in all (odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-1.70; P = .43), symptomatic (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.14-1.98; P = .38), or asymptomatic patients (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.06-5.42; P = .99).\nThe published outcomes from high-volume centers demonstrate that surgical revascularization and stenting are both technically feasible in postradiotherapy carotid stenosis and have similar safety profiles to nonirradiated necks. Radiation should therefore not be considered a contraindication to surgical intervention.",

    "abstract": "Autologous greater saphenous vein (GSV) graft is frequently used as a conduit during arterial bypass. Preoperative vein mapping has been traditionally used to assess conduit adequacy and define GSV anatomy, thereby decreasing operative time and reducing wound complications. The purpose of this study was to determine whether GSV mapping using computed tomography angiography (CTA) closely correlated with that of traditional duplex ultrasonography (US).\nFrom August 2009 through June 2011, 88 limbs from 51 patients underwent CTA of the lower extremities for the purpose of defining arterial anatomy with concurrent US for preoperative vein mapping. GSV diameters were measured by two blinded reviewers on CTA (both antero-posterior [AP] and lateral dimensions) and compared with US-based measurements at levels of the proximal thigh, mid-thigh, knee, mid-calf, and ankle. CTA and US measurements were compared at each anatomic level using linear regression. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. Charge reduction was calculated based on technical and professional fees for each imaging study.\nGSV diameter sequentially decreased from the proximal thigh to the mid-calf and then increased to the ankle as measured by CTA and US. CTA-based measurements of the GSV significantly correlated with US GSV diameters (R = 0.927 [lateral dimension], 0.922 [AP dimension]; P < .005). The strongest degree of correlation occurred in measurements at the proximal thigh, followed by the mid-thigh, mid-calf, knee, and ankle. GSV measurement by CTA was over 90% sensitive and accurate for detecting appropriate GSV diameter for bypass (diameter >2.0 mm). Eliminating preoperative US vein mapping for the study patients at our institution would have resulted in charge reductions of $49,316 over the study period.\nIndirect venography by CTA correlates well with US for GSV mapping in the lower extremity and offers significant reduction in imaging-related preoperative charges. CTA is sensitive and accurate for detecting GSVs that are appropriate for bypass. Furthermore, CTA allows AP and lateral evaluation of the GSV throughout its anatomic course. As CTA is often performed prior to arterial bypass, indirect evaluation of the GSV using preoperative CTA should be considered a promising alternative to the use of US.",

    "abstract": "Pulsatile flow in deep, perforating veins and varicose veins (VVs) has been described previously to support a hypothesis of arteriovenous (AV) fistulae in the pathogenesis of VVs. Its presence has also been suggested as a cause of failure of VV treatments. However, AV communications have never been adequately visualized and direct pressure tracings within leg veins have been inconclusive. The present study was observational aiming to investigate the prevalence and rate of spontaneous pulsation within the great saphenous vein (GSV) in volunteers and patients using color duplex and compare this to reflux and markers of disease severity.\nTwenty-seven consecutive patients (32 legs, median Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) = 5 [0-11]) attending the VV clinic and 23 consecutive ambulatory normal volunteers (46 legs) had their GSV assessed at midthigh using color duplex. Subjects were examined standing with the hips resting against an adjustable couch, bearing weight on the contralateral leg, with the test leg touching the ground. The presence of flow and reflux were initially determined using manual calf compression. Saphenous pulsation (SP) was defined as a cyclical change in velocity. The GSV diameter and SP rate were then recorded after 2 minutes of dependency. The number of pulsations was counted from video recordings.\nThe resting SP, if present, was discrete, monophasic, of variable amplitude, antegrade, and irregular, irrespective of respiration. Pulsation was detected in 2/44 (4.5%) legs with C(0-1) (C part of CEAP), 9/17 (52.9%) legs with C(2-3), and 16/17 (94.1%) legs with C(4-6) (P < .05, z test of column proportions). Reflux occurred in 8/32 (25%) legs without SP (C(0) = 2, C(1) = 1, C(2) = 3, C(3) = 2). The median GSV diameter was significantly elevated in the presence of SP (no pulse: 3.5 [range, 1.5-8.1] mm; pulse: 7 [range, 4-9.4] mm; P < .0005). The median refluxing GSV diameter in GSV pulsators compared with nonpulsators was 7 (range, 4-9.4) mm; vs 5.1 (range, 2.7-8.1) mm, respectively (P = .003). The median SP rate in refluxing GSVs was 52 (range, 22-95) beats per minute.\nThe high prevalence of pulsatile antegrade saphenous flow is a novel observation in patients with severe superficial chronic venous insufficiency. It is detectable in 75% of patients with GSV reflux and significantly increases with clinical severity and saphenous diameter. It may be a marker of advanced venous disease and, as it is easy to record, it could supplement duplex evaluations of reflux. Further work is needed to establish the clinical relevance of the SP in terms of disease progression, recurrence after treatment, and as a hemodynamic marker of severity.",

    "abstract": "Blunt abdominal aortic injury (BAAI) is very rare, and current literature is limited to case series of single-center experience. Through an analysis of the National Trauma Data Bank, the largest aggregation of United States trauma registry data, our aim was to characterize the associated injury pattern, contemporary management, and in-hospital outcomes of patients with BAAI.\nWe used a nested case-control design. The overall cohort consisted of adult patients (age \u2265 16 years) severely injured (Injury Severity Score \u2265 16) after blunt trauma who were treated at a level 1 or 2 trauma center in years 2007 to 2009. Cases were patients with BAAI and were frequency-matched by age group and mechanism to randomly selected controls at a one-to-five ratio. Multivariable matched analysis (conditional logistic regression) was used to derive adjusted measures of association between BAAI and adjacent arterial, intra-abdominal, and bony injuries.\nWe identified 436 patients with BAAI from 180 centers. The mean Injury Severity Score was 35 \u00b1 14, and most patients were injured in motor vehicle crashes (84%). Multivariable analysis showed injury to the thoracic aorta, renal and iliac artery, small bowel, colon, liver, pancreas, and kidney, as well as lumbar spine fractures were independently associated with BAAI. A total of 394 patients (90%) were managed nonoperatively, and 42 (10%) underwent repair. Of these 42 patients, 29 (69%) underwent endovascular repair, with 11 patients undergoing open aortic repair and two extra-anatomic bypasses. Median time from admission to repair was 1 day (interquartile range, 1-2 days). Overall mortality was 29%. A total of 271 (69%) patients managed nonoperatively survived to hospital discharge.\nThe index of suspicion for BAAI should be raised in severely injured patients by the presence of injuries to the lumbar spine, bowel, retroperitoneal organs, and adjacent major arteries. Although endovascular repair is the most common intervention, most patients are managed nonoperatively and survive to hospital discharge.",

    "abstract": "Owing to the difficulty of removing acute and chronic thrombus from autogenous accesses (AA) by standard surgical and endovascular techniques, many surgeons consider efforts to salvage a thrombosed AA as being futile. We describe a simple technique to extract acute and chronic thrombus from a failed AA. This technique involves making an incision adjacent to the anastomosis, directly extracting the arterial plug, and manually milking thrombus from the access. This report details the outcomes of a series of thrombosed AAs treated by surgical thrombectomy/intervention using this technique for manual clot extraction.\nA total of 146 surgical thrombectomies/interventions were performed in 102 patients to salvage a thrombosed AA. Mean follow-up was 15.6 months. Office, hospital, and dialysis unit records were reviewed to identify patient demographics, define procedure type, and determine functional patency rates. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate primary and secondary functional patency rates.\nComplete extraction of thrombus from the AA was achieved in 140 of 146 cases (95%). The studied procedure itself was technically successful in 127 cases (87%). Reasons for failure were the inability to completely extract thrombus from the AA in six, failed angioplasty due to long segment vein stenosis or sclerosis in seven or vein rupture in two, and central vein occlusion in one. Three failures occurred for unknown causes \u2264 3 days of successful thrombectomy. No single factor analyzed (age, sex, race, diabetes status, access type or location) was associated with technical failure. The estimated primary and secondary functional patency rates were 27% \u00b1 5% and 61% \u00b1 6% at 12 months.\nThe manual clot extraction technique described in this report effectively removed acute and chronic thrombus from failed AAs. Its use, combined with an intervention to treat the underlying cause for AA failure, significantly extended access durability.",

Three failures occurred for unknown causes \u2264 3 days of successful thrombectomy. No single factor analyzed (age, sex, race, diabetes status, access type or location) was associated with technical failure.

    "abstract": "The aim of this review was to assess the place of retroperitoneal (RP) aortic surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in the endovascular era and evaluate the evidence supporting it in preference to the more traditional transperitoneal approach. As endovascular graft technology improves, open aortic surgery is declining. AAAs unsuitable for endovascular aneurysm repair are, by definition, anatomically challenging. The RP approach is especially suited to anatomic challenges such as those posed by contemporary open AAA because it facilitates access to the suprarenal aorta. There is evidence that the RP approach reduces postoperative morbidity and length of stay compared with transperitoneal approaches. The evidence available indicates that the RP approach should be the first considered for any AAA unsuitable for endovascular aneurysm repair; however, the technique is more difficult to learn and less commonly practiced than the transperitoneal approach. Combined with a decrease in training hours in the United Kingdom, there is a real threat that the RP technique will only be performed by an ever-decreasing number of enthusiasts.",

    "abstract": "Because vein graft neointimal hyperplasia engenders vein graft failure, and because most vein graft neointimal cells derive from outside the vein graft, we sought to determine whether vein graft neointimal hyperplasia is affected by activity of the CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4), which is important for bone marrow-derived cell migration.\nIn congenic Cxcr4(-/+) and wild-type (WT) recipient mice, we performed interposition grafting of the common carotid artery with the inferior vena cava (IVC) of either Cxcr4(-/+) or WT mice to create four surgically chimeric groups of mice (n \u2265 5 each), characterized by vein graft donor/recipient: WT/WT; Cxcr4(-/+)/WT; WT/Cxcr4(-/+); and Cxcr4(-/+)/Cxcr4(-/+); vein grafts were harvested 6 weeks postoperatively.\nThe agonist for CXCR4 is expressed by cells in the arterializing vein graft. Vein graft neointimal hyperplasia was reduced by reducing CXCR4 activity in vein graft-extrinsic cells, but not in vein graft-intrinsic cells: the rank order of neointimal hyperplasia was WT/WT \u2248 Cxcr4(-/+)/WT > WT/Cxcr4(-/+) \u2248 Cxcr4(-/+)/Cxcr4(-/+); CXCR4 deficiency in graft-extrinsic cells reduced neointimal hyperplasia by 39% to 47% (P < .05). Vein graft medial area was equivalent in all grafts except Cxcr4(-/+)/Cxcr4(-/+), in which the medial area was 60% \u00b1 20% greater (P < .05). Vein graft re-endothelialization was indistinguishable among all three vein graft groups. However, the prevalence of medial leukocytes was 40% \u00b1 10% lower in Cxcr4(-/+)/Cxcr4(-/+) than in WT/WT vein grafts (P < .05), and the prevalence of smooth muscle actin-positive cells was 45% \u00b1 20% higher (P < .05).\nWe conclude that CXCR4 contributes to vein graft neointimal hyperplasia through mechanisms that alter homing to the vein graft of graft-extrinsic cells, particularly leukocytes.\nThe utility of autologous vein grafts is severely reduced by neointimal hyperplasia, which accelerates subsequent graft atherosclerosis. Our study demonstrates that vein graft neointimal hyperplasia is aggravated by activity of the cell-surface \u201cCXC\u201d chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4), which is critical for recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells to sites of inflammation. Our model for CXCR4 deficiency used mice with heterozygous deficiency of Cxcr4. Consequently, our results suggest the possibility that a CXCR4 antagonist--like plerixafor, currently in clinical use--could be applied to vein grafts periadventitially, and perhaps achieve beneficial effects on vein graft neointimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) resolution instigates an inflammatory response, resulting in vessel wall damage and scarring. Urokinase-plasminogen activator (uPA) and its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), are integral components of the fibrinolytic system, essential for venous thrombosis (VT) resolution. This study determined the vein wall response when exposed to increased and decreased plasmin activity.\nA mouse inferior vena cava (IVC) ligation model in uPA -/- or PAI-1 -/- and their genetic wild types (B6/SvEv and C57/BL6, respectively) was used to create stasis thrombi, with tissue harvest at either 8 or 21 days. Tissue analysis included gene expression of vascular smooth muscle cells (alpha smooth muscle actin [\u03b1SMA], SM22) and endothelial marker (CD31), by real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 activity by zymography, and vein wall collagen by picro-Sirius red histologic analysis. A P < .05 was considered significant.\nThrombi were significantly larger in both 8-day and 21-day uPA -/- as compared with wild type (WT) and were significantly smaller in both 8-day and 21-day PAI-1 -/- as compared with WT. Correspondingly, 8-day plasmin levels were reduced in half in uPA -/- and increased three-fold in PAI-1 -/- when compared with respective WT thrombi (P < .05; n = 5-6). The endothelial marker CD31 was elevated two-fold in PAI-1 -/- mice at 8 days, but reduced 2.5-fold at 21 days in uPA -/- as compared with WT (P = .02; n = 5-6), suggesting less endothelial preservation. Vein wall vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) gene expression showed that 8-day and 21-day PAI-1 -/- mice had 2.3- and 3.8-fold more SM22 and 1.8- and 2.3-fold more \u03b1SMA expression than respective WT (P < .05; n = 5-7), as well as 1.8-fold increased \u03b1SMA (+) cells (P \u2264 .05; n = 3-5). No significant difference in MMP-2 or -9 activity was found in the PAI-1 -/- mice compared with WT, while 5.4-fold more MMP-9 was present in 21-day WT than 21-day uPA -/- (P = .03; n = 5). Lastly, collagen was \u223ctwo-fold greater at 8 days in PAI-1 -/- IVC as compared with WT (P = .03; n = 6) with no differences observed in uPA -/- mice.\nIn stasis DVT, plasmin activity is critical for thrombus resolution. Divergent vein wall responses occur with gain or loss of plasmin activity, and despite smaller VT, greater vein wall fibrosis was associated with lack of PAI-1.",

    "abstract": "High restenosis rates are a limitation of peripheral vascular interventions. Previous studies have shown that surgical implantation of a tissue-engineered endothelium onto the adventitia surface of injured vessels regulates vascular repair. In the present study, we developed a particulate formulation of tissue-engineered endothelium and a method to deliver the formulation perivascular to injured blood vessels using a percutaneous, minimally invasive technique.\nStainless steel stents were implanted in 18 balloon-injured femoral arteries of nine domestic swine, followed by ultrasound-guided percutaneous perivascular injection of gelatin particles containing cultured allogeneic porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAE). Controls received injections of empty particles (matrix) or no perivascular injection (sham) after stent deployment. Animals were sacrificed after 90 days.\nAngiographic analysis revealed a significantly greater lumen diameter in the stented segments of arteries treated with PAE/matrix (4.72 \u00b1 0.12 mm) compared with matrix (4.01 \u00b1 0.20 mm) or sham (4.03 \u00b1 0.16 mm) controls (P < .05). Similarly, histologic analysis revealed that PAE/matrix-treated arteries had the greatest lumen area (20.4 \u00b1 0.7 mm(2); P < .05) compared with controls (16.1 \u00b1 0.9 mm(2) and 17.1 \u00b1 1.0 mm(2) for sham and matrix controls, respectively) and the smallest intimal area (3.3 \u00b1 0.4 mm(2); P < .05) compared with controls (6.2 \u00b1 0.5 mm(2) and 4.4 \u00b1 0.5 mm(2) for sham and matrix controls, respectively). Overall, PAE-treated arteries had a 33% to 50% decrease in percent occlusion (P < .05) compared with controls. Histopathological analysis revealed fewer leukocytes present in the intima in the PAE/matrix group compared with control groups, suggesting that the biological effects were in part due to inhibition of the inflammatory phase of the vascular response to injury.\nMinimally invasive, perivascular delivery of PAE/matrix to stented arteries was performed safely using ultrasound-guided percutaneous injections and significantly decreased stenosis. Application at the time of or subsequent to peripheral interventions may decrease clinical restenosis rates.",

    "abstract": "Muscular injuries contribute to perioperative and long-term morbidity after vascular surgery in humans. We determined whether local and remote ischemic postconditioning might similarly decrease muscle mitochondrial dysfunction through reduced oxidative stress.\nEighteen male Black-6 mice were divided in three groups: (1) sham mice had no ischemia (sham), (2) ischemia-reperfusion (IR) mice underwent 2-hour tourniquet-induced ischemia on both hind limbs, followed by 2-hour reperfusion, and (3) postconditioning (PoC) mice underwent four bouts of 30-second reperfusion and 30-second ischemia at the onset of reperfusion on the right limb; thus, the right limb underwent local PoC and left limb underwent remote PoC (rPoC). Maximal oxidative capacity (V(max)) of the gastrocnemius muscle mitochondrial respiratory chain was measured. Oxidative stress was evaluated by dihydroethidium staining. Expressions of genes involved in antioxidant defense (superoxide dismutase [SOD1], SOD2, glutathione peroxidase [GPx]), apoptosis (Bax, BclII), and inflammation (interleukin-6) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Muscle inflammation was determined using immunohistochemistry.\nIR reduced V(max) (8.5 \u00b1 2.2 vs 10.2 \u00b1 1.8 \u03bcmol O(2)/min/g dry weight; P = .034), and increased dihydroethidium staining (134.8%; P = .039). IR decreased GPx expression (-47.9%; P = .048) and increased the proapoptotic marker Bax (255.5%; P = .020). Local PoC and rPoC further increased these deleterious effects. PoC decreased V(max) to 4.4 \u00b1 1.4 \u03bcmol O(2)/min/g dry weight (sham vs PoC, -56.9% [P < .001]; IR vs PoC, -48.2% [P < .001]). rPoC similarly reduced V(max) to 5.1 \u00b1 1.9 \u03bcmol O(2)/min/g dry weight (sham vs PoC, -50.0% [P < .001]; IR vs PoC, -40.0% [P = .001]). Dihydroethidium staining was further increased by PoC (207.2%; P = .002) and rPoC (305.4%; P < .001) compared with sham and was associated with macrophage infiltration. Local PoC increased SOD1, SOD2, and the antiapoptotic Bcl-2, and rPoC increased Bax (391.6%; P < .001) and the Bax/BclII ratio (621.7%; P < .001).\nLocal and remote ischemic postconditioning further increased injury by enhancing mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress production, and inflammation. Caution should be applied when considering ischemic postconditioning in vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "We report two cases of ruptured pancreaticoduodenal arcade aneurysms that were successfully treated by embolotherapy. In these cases, contrast-enhanced computed tomography, sagittal reformed images, and angiography revealed celiac artery stenoses due to compression by the median arcuate ligament. Computed tomography also showed acute localized dissection in the distal celiac axis, suggesting that aneurysmal rupture had occurred immediately after development of the dissection. When unruptured pancreaticoduodenal arcade aneurysms are identified in the context of celiac artery dissection, the possibility of rupture may be high and requires strict observation and consideration of embolotherapy.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the risk factors of incomplete thrombosis in the false lumen after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in patients with extensive acute type B aortic dissection.\nThis was a retrospective study at Zhongda Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, China. Between January 2005 and May 2008, patients with acute type B dissection who underwent TEVAR at two centers were reviewed and 124 who met the following criteria were included in this study: (1) dissection involving the aorta below the level of the celiac artery, (2) completely patent false lumen at the time of intervention, and (3) complete initial diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scans and all follow-up CT scans available. Exclusion criteria were (1) aortic dissection secondary to trauma, (2) intramural hematoma, and (3) Marfan patients. The main outcome measures were demographics, comorbidity profiles, technical details of procedures, anatomic characteristics of dissection, and false lumen status of thrombosis during follow-up. Ordinal regression analysis was performed with variables that reached P < .20 on univariate analysis to investigate independent risk factors of incomplete thrombosis in the false lumen.\nUnivariate analysis showed that the age at TEVAR, hypertension, maximum diameter of the abdominal aorta and false lumen at the abdominal level, re-entry tears, and visceral branches that arose partially or totally from the false lumen had a P < .20. Further analysis with an ordinal regression model showed that the visceral branches that arose partially or totally from the false lumen (odds ratio [OR], 10.054; P < .001), re-entry tears (OR, 30.661; P < .001), and maximum diameter of the false lumen on the abdominal aorta (OR, 1.265; P = .004) were the significant risk factors of incomplete thrombosis in the false lumen after TEVAR.\nVisceral branches that arose partially or totally from the false lumen, re-entry tears, and maximum diameter of the false lumen on the abdominal aorta were the risk factors of incomplete thrombosis in the false lumen after TEVAR in extensive acute type B dissection.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the anatomic distribution and associated mortality of combat-related vascular injuries comparing them to a contemporary civilian standard.\nThe Joint Trauma Theater Registry (JTTR) was queried to identify patients with major compressible arterial injury (CAI) and noncompressible arterial injury (NCAI) sites, and their outcomes, among casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2003 to 2006. The National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) was then queried over the same time frame to identify civilian trauma patients with similar arterial injuries. Propensity score-based matching was used to create matched patient cohorts from both populations for analysis.\nRegistry queries identified 380 patients from the JTTR and 7020 patients from the NTDB who met inclusion criteria. Propensity score matching for age, elevated Injury Severity Score (ISS; >15), and hypotension on arrival (systolic blood pressure [SBP] <90) resulted in 167 matched patients from each registry. The predominating mechanism of injury among matched JTTR patients was explosive events (73.1%), whereas penetrating injury was more common in the NTDB group (61.7%). In the matched cohorts, the incidence of NCAI did not differ (22.2% JTTR vs 26.6% NTDB; P = .372), but the NTDB patients had a higher incidence of CAI (73.7% vs 59.3%; P = .005). The JTTR cohort was also found to have a higher incidence of associated venous injury (57.5% vs 23.4%; P < .001). Overall, the matched JTTR cohort had a lower mortality than NTDB counterparts (4.2% vs 12.6%; P = .006), a finding that was also noted among patients with NCAI (10.8% vs 36.4%; P = .008). There was no difference in mortality between matched JTTR and NTDB patients with CAI overall (2.0% vs 4.1%; P = .465), or among those presenting with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <8 (28.6% vs 40.0%; P = 1.00) or shock (SBP <90; 10.5% vs 7.7%; P = 1.00). The JTTR mortality rate among patients with CAI was, however, lower among patients with ISS >15 compared with civilian matched counterparts (10.7% vs 42.4%; P = .006).\nMortality of injured service personnel who reach a medical treatment facility after major arterial injury compares favorably to a matched civilian standard. Acceptable mortality rates within the military cohort are related to key aspects of an organized Joint Trauma System, including prehospital tactical combat casualty care, rapid medical evacuation to forward surgical capability, and implementation of clinical practice guidelines. Aspects of this comprehensive combat casualty care strategy may translate and be of value to management of arterial injury in the civilian sector.",

    "abstract": "Risk prediction is important in medical management, especially to optimize patient management before surgical intervention. No quantitative risk scores or predictors are available for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Surgical risk and prognosis are usually based on anesthetic scores or clinical evaluation. We suggest that renal function is a better predictor of risk than other cardiovascular parameters. This study used the four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD-4)-calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to compare classical cardiovascular risk factors with prognosis and cardiovascular events of hospitalized PAD patients.\nThe study evaluated 204 patients who were admitted for vascular intervention and diagnosed with grade IIb, III, or IV PAD or with carotid or renal stenosis. Those with carotid or renal stenosis were excluded, leaving 188 patients who were randomized from 2004 to 2005 and monitored until 2010. We performed a life-table analysis with a 6-year follow-up period and one final checkpoint. The following risk factors were evaluated: age, sex, ischemic heart disease, ictus (as a manifestation of cerebrovascular disease related to systemic arterial disease), diabetes, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type of vascular intervention, and urea and creatinine plasma levels. The GFR was calculated using the MDRD-4 equation. Death, major cardiovascular events, and reintervention for arterial disease were recorded during the follow-up.\nPatients (73% men) were a mean age of 71.38 \u00b1 11.43 (standard deviation) years. PAD grade IIb was diagnosed in 41 (20%) and grade III-IV in 147 (72%). Forty-two minor amputations (20.6%), 21 major amputations (10.3%), and 102 revascularizations (50%) were performed. A major cardiovascular event occurred in 60 patients (29.4%), and 71 (34.8%) died. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the MDRD-4 GFR, age, and male sex were independent variables related to death and that the MDRD-4 GFR and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were related to major cardiovascular events. A statistically significant relationship was also found between serum creatinine levels and reintervention rates.\nThe MDRD-4 GFR was a better predictor of risk of death or infarction than classical cardiovascular risk factors in patients with PAD. This suggests that its routine use in the initial evaluation in patients with PAD is beneficial.",

There is a growing concern for cancers associated with inadvertent use of CT scans. We report the estimated risk of radiation associated solid organ malignancy caused by routine surveillance CT after EVAR using the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR VII) model created by U.S. National Institute of Science and National Research Council.\nOur study estimated the excess relative risk (ERR) of a patient acquiring a solid organ malignancy secondary to radiation exposure from postoperative EVAR surveillance CT imaging. The radiation dose was calculated in sieverts (Sv). The ERR of solid organ malignancy, as given by the BEIR VII model, is = \u03b2(s) D exp {\u03b3e*} (a/60)(\u03b7), where \u03b2(s), \u03b3, and \u03b7 are data-derived parameters, e is age at exposure, and e* = (e-30)/10 for e < 30 and zero for e \u2265 30, a is attained age, and D is dose in sieverts. Dose-weighted ERRs were calculated to allow a comparison of malignancy risk when using a CT at all time points (model 1: 0, 1, 6, 12, and 18 months, 2, 3, and 4 years, and yearly thereafter) vs replacing the CT scan with two other models (model 2: CT once in 3 years) and (model 3: CT once in 5 years). The risk was stratified by age groups, sex, and use of two different radiation doses (15 or 31 mSv) per CT scan. Statistical analysis used the paired t test.\nThere were significant differences between the ERR of solid organ malignancy in those patients who would undergo surveillance CTs at all time points vs those whose surveillance consisted of alternative modalities at some time points (P < .0001). The cumulative ERR of cancer from radiation was higher in those exposed to contrast-enhanced CT scans, younger people, with highest in the group aged 50 to 55 years (ERR, 0.43), and lowest in patients aged \u2265 80 years (ERR, 0.10).\nPatients undergoing routine CT scans for postoperative surveillance after EVAR are at risk for acquiring new solid organ malignancy due to radiation exposure. The risk is higher in young patients, women, and those exposed to multiple contrast-enhanced CT scans. Our analysis questions the need for routine surveillance CT scans after EVAR in the absence of endoleaks or a change in aneurysm morphology, based on an increased malignancy risk.",

    "abstract": "Surgical treatment for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome does not always yield successful outcomes. The purpose of this study was to describe patients with unresolved, recurrent, and/or contralateral symptoms following first rib resection and scalenectomy (FRRS) and to determine therapies for improving their outcomes.\nData on 161 neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome patients (182 FRRS procedures) were prospectively collected from 2003 to 2011 and retrospectively reviewed for evidence of unresolved, recurrent, and/or contralateral neurogenic symptoms following FRRS. Demographic and clinical characteristics, interventions, and outcomes were compared between these patients and those with a successful result.\nTwenty-three patients (24 FRRS) had unresolved symptoms at a mean of 16.1 \u00b1 14.7 postoperative months. Compared with successes, these patients were older (mean age, 45 vs 38 years; P = .002) and active smokers (33% vs 13%; P = .031), with a longer duration of symptoms (90 vs 48 months; P = .005). They had higher rates of chronic pain syndromes (67% vs 14%; P < .001), neck and/or shoulder comorbidities (58% vs 22%; P < .001), preoperative opioid use (67% vs 31%; P = .001), and preoperative Botox injections (46% vs 20%; P = .009) with less relief (18% vs 64%; P = .014). Sixteen patients had recurrent symptoms at a mean of 12.1 \u00b1 9.7 postoperative months. These patients had more chronic pain syndromes (38%; P = .028) and neck and/or shoulder comorbidities (50%; P = .027), with recurrence secondary to scar tissue (69%; P < .001) and reinjury (31%; P = .002). Postoperative treatments for both groups included physical therapy and local injections, where six unresolved (26%) and 13 recurrent (81%) patients achieved freedom from opioids at the end of the follow-up period. Twenty-one patients had contralateral symptoms and underwent secondary FRRS at a mean of 15.0 months (range, 7-30 months) following primary FRRS. The first operation was successful in 90% of cases.\nPatients with unresolved symptoms are older, active smokers with more comorbid pain syndromes, neck and/or shoulder disease, and a longer symptom duration. These patients face a more difficult recovery, whereas patients with recurrent symptoms are well managed with physical therapy and Botox injections. Patients with contralateral symptoms at >1 year are effectively treated with secondary FRRS. Patients must be followed closely after FRRS to determine if additional interventions are necessary to ensure successful results.",

    "abstract": "Publication of the eagerly anticipated Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial in May 2010 was anticipated to engender much activity in the realm of interventions for carotid stenosis. Specifically, a variety of professional societies, including the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), published updated practice guidelines in the calendar year 2011, timed to include data from large-scale well-conducted clinical trials comparing carotid endarterectomy with carotid artery stenting (CAS). In anticipation of a renewed application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to reconsider the national coverage determination for CAS, the SVS Board of Directors voted in June 2011 against any change in the national coverage determination for CAS. CMS convened a Medicare evidence development and coverage advisory committee (MEDCAC) meeting to consider fundamental aspects of the treatment of carotid atherosclerosis on January 25, 2012, to allow an unbiased and current deliberation of the state-of-the-art technology and science referable to the management of carotid atherosclerosis. The MEDCAC differs substantially from a reconsideration of coverage determination and, in this case, was built around seven research questions. The MEDCAC consists of a panel of experts who, after reviewing the literature and submitted comments by interested stakeholders, and after hearing testimony from invited speakers and at-large presentations, held a panel vote on the research questions. Given that management of carotid atherosclerosis is a core element of vascular surgical practice, the SVS had a major presence at the MEDCAC in the form of a comprehensive written document individually considering the research questions and a variety of presentations addressing various aspects in carotid disease management. The purpose of this report is to detail the SVS's position on the MEDCAC research questions referable to the management of carotid atherosclerosis and to otherwise detail the proceedings of the MEDCAC.",

    "abstract": "The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), in partnership with key specialty and subspecialty societies, conducted a review of common clinical scenarios where noninvasive vascular testing (ultrasound and physiological testing) is frequently considered. The indications (clinical scenarios) were derived from common applications or anticipated uses, as well as from current clinical practice guidelines and results of studies examining the implementation of the original appropriate use criteria (AUC). The 159 indications in this document were developed by a diverse writing group and scored by a separate independent technical panel on a scale of 1 to 9, to designate appropriate use (median 7 to 9), uncertain use (median 4 to 6), and inappropriate use (median 1 to 3). A total of 255 indications (with the inclusion of surveillance timeframes) were rated. One hundred and seventeen indications were rated as appropriate, 84 were rated as uncertain, and 54 were rated as inappropriate. The AUC for peripheral vascular disease have the potential to impact physician decision making, healthcare delivery, and reimbursement policy. Furthermore, recognition of uncertain clinical scenarios facilitates identification of areas that would benefit from future research.",

    "abstract": "The ideal hemostatic agent for treatment of suture-line bleeding at vascular anastomoses has not yet been established. This study evaluated whether the use of a fibrin sealant containing 500 IU/mL thrombin and synthetic aprotinin (FS; marketed in the United States under the name TISSEEL) is beneficial for treatment of challenging suture-line bleeding at vascular anastomoses of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts, including those further complicated by concomitant antiplatelet therapies.\nOver a 1-year period ending in 2010, ePTFE graft prostheses, including arterio-arterial bypasses and arteriovenous shunts, were placed in 140 patients who experienced suture-line bleeding that required treatment after completion of anastomotic suturing. Across 24 US study sites, 70 patients were randomized and treated with FS and 70 with manual compression (control). The primary end point was the proportion of patients who achieved hemostasis at the study suture line at 4 minutes after start of application of FS or positioning of surgical gauze pads onto the study suture line.\nThere was a statistically significant difference in the comparison of hemostasis rates at the study suture line at 4 minutes between FS (62.9%) and control (31.4%) patients (P < .0001), which was the primary end point. Similarly, hemostasis rates in the subgroup of patients on antiplatelet therapies were 64.7% (FS group) and 28.2% (control group). When analyzed by bleeding severity, the hemostatic advantage of FS over control at 4 minutes was similar (27.8% absolute improvement for moderate bleeding vs 32.8% for severe bleeding). Logistic regression analysis (accounting for gender, age, intervention type, bleeding severity, blood pressure, heparin coating of ePTFE graft, and antiplatelet therapies) found a statistically significant treatment effect in the odds ratio (OR) of meeting the primary end point between treatment groups (OR, 6.73; P < .0001), as well as statistically significant effects for intervention type (OR, 0.25; P = .0055) and bleeding severity (OR, 2.59; P = .0209). The safety profile of FS was excellent as indicated by the lack of any related serious adverse events.\nThe findings from this phase 3 study confirmed that FS is safe and its efficacy is superior to manual compression for hemostasis in patients with peripheral vascular ePTFE grafts. The data also suggest that FS promotes hemostasis independently of the patient's own coagulation system, as shown in a representative population of patients with vascular disease under single- or dual-antiplatelet therapies.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair (EVAR) of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) has become first-line therapy at our institution and is performed under a standardized protocol. We compare perioperative mortality, midterm survival, and morbidity after EVAR and open surgical repair (OSR).\nRecords were retrospectively reviewed from May 2000 to September 2010 for repair of infrarenal rAAAs. Primary end points included perioperative mortality and midterm survival. Secondary end points included acute limb ischemia, length of stay, ventilator-dependent respiratory failure, myocardial infarction, renal failure, abdominal compartment syndrome, and secondary intervention. Statistical analysis was performed using the t-test, \u03c7(2) test, the Fisher exact test, and logistic regression calculations. Midterm survival was assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models.\nSeventy-four infrarenal rAAAs were repaired, 19 by EVAR and 55 by OSR. Despite increased age and comorbidity in the EVAR patients, perioperative mortality was 15.7% for EVAR, which was significantly lower than the 49% for OSR (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.74; P = .008). Midterm survival also favored EVAR (hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21-0.77; P = .028, adjusted for age and sex). Mean follow-up was 20 months, and 1-year survival was 60% for EVAR vs 45% for OSR. Mean length of stay for patients surviving >1 day was 10 days for EVAR and 21 days for OSR (P = .004). Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure was 5% in the EVAR group vs 42% for OSR (odds ratio, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01-0.62; P = .001).\nEVAR of rAAA has a superior perioperative survival advantage and decreased morbidity vs OSR. Although not statistically significant, overall survival favors EVAR. We recommend that EVAR be considered as the first-line treatment of rAAAs and practiced as the standard of care.",

Despite increased age and comorbidity in the EVAR patients, perioperative mortality was 15.7% for EVAR, which was significantly lower than the 49% for OSR (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.74; P = .008). Midterm survival also favored EVAR (hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21-0.77; P = .028, adjusted for age and sex). Mean follow-up was 20 months, and 1-year survival was 60% for EVAR vs 45% for OSR. Mean length of stay for patients surviving >1 day was 10 days for EVAR and 21 days for OSR (P = .004).

    "abstract": "Outcomes following transcatheter interventions at vascular and general surgery teaching hospitals (STH) are unknown. We examine whether surgery training programs influence clinically relevant outcomes after commonly performed endovascular procedures.\nUsing an all-payer inpatient care database from 2008, we selected adults who underwent either endovascular carotid stenting, endografting of descending thoracic aortic aneurysm, endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, or peripheral arterial revascularization. Patients were stratified by procedures completed at Surgery Teaching (Participate in Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education [ACGME]-accredited vascular and general surgery programs), STH, or nonteaching hospitals (NTH). Hierarchical regression models assessed adverse outcomes and in-hospital mortality among groups.\nOf the 175,698 records, 44% of the patients were treated at STH, while 56% underwent procedures at NTH. The adjusted odds ratio of any complication or mortality at STH and NTH were similar. Transfers, weekend admissions, and nonelective cases were higher at STH (P < .001, respectively). Paradoxically, STH treated fewer patients with more than three comorbidities compared with NTH (STH: 47% vs NTH: 53%; P < .001). Surgical teaching status did not lower the adjusted odds of mortality for any procedure. Moreover, the occurrence of any complication (adjusted odds ratios, 0.9; 95% confidence interval, .82-1.14; P = .69) and mortality (adjusted odds ratios, 0.9; 95% confidence interval, .74-1.22; P = .67) were equivalent between vascular and general STH.\nFollowing commonly performed transcatheter vascular procedures, and despite more transfers, weekend admissions, and nonelective procedures completed at STH, complications, and mortality were comparable across centers.",

To illustrate this, we examined the changes in patient-derived geometries of aortic dissections, which showed progressive false lumen aneurysmal dilatation (26% diameter increase) during follow-up. Total pressure was decreased by 29% during systole and by 34% during retrograde flow. At the site of the highest false lumen dilatation, the temporal average of total pressure decreased from 45 to 22 Pa, and maximal average wall shear stress decreased from 0.9 to 0.4 Pa. These first results in the study of disease progression of type III DeBakey aortic dissection with computational fluid dynamics are encouraging.",

    "abstract": "Health care reform is forcing \"alignment\" between hospitals and physicians. The acceleration of employment of physicians by hospitals is bringing into focus contractual terms where compensation is tied to clinical productivity. Physician productivity is being almost entirely defined by work relative value units (WRVUs). However, vascular surgeons may bring value to a health system in ways that are unique and separate from clinical revenue as measured by WRVUs. Incentives for physicians should also be tied to behaviors that are desired, such as quality of care, efficiency, patient outcomes, patient satisfaction scores, teaching, and research, depending on the specific environment. Vascular surgeons must be aware of proper use and misuse of WRVUs and have access to the most appropriate benchmarks in negotiations for employment. With increasing employment of physicians by hospitals and focus on \"alignment,\" a more comprehensive measure of physician productivity is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Development in endograft design has extended endovascular treatment to include thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA). We report our experience using fenestrated and branched endografts in the management of TAAA.\nWe analyzed a cohort of consecutive patients treated electively for TAAA using endovascular techniques between 2006 and 2011. All data were collected prospectively. The relationships between preoperative risk factors and clinical outcome were examined using univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. We also compared the outcomes between 33 previously published early cases (EC) with the last 56 later cases (LC).\nEighty-nine patients (83 men) were treated. Median age was 69 years. All patients were deemed unfit for open surgery. The 30-day and in-hospital mortality rates were 8.9% and 10%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed in-hospital mortality was associated with preoperative chronic renal failure and advanced age. Higher postoperative mean arterial blood pressure was a protective factor. Technical success rate was 96.6% (94% and 98% in the EC and LC groups, respectively; P = .14). The spinal cord ischemia (SCI) rate was 7.8% (15% and 3% in the EC and LC groups, respectively; P = .063) and was associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and procedure duration. Six patients (6.7%) required temporary filtration, but none required permanent renal support (associated with left ventricular ejection fraction <40% and procedure duration). Median procedure duration decreased from 232 to 203 minutes (P = .01) in the EC and LC groups, respectively. Actuarial survival was 86.8% \u00b1 3.7% at 1 year and 74.7% \u00b1 6% at 2 years.\nAlthough we have treated a cohort at high operative risk, our midterm results compare favorably with the published series of conventional surgery. Accurate hemodynamic control represented by high-normal perioperative blood pressure seems to protect against severe postoperative complications.",

    "abstract": "This study determined early and intermediate results of multibranched endovascular thoracoabdominal (TAAA) and pararenal aortic aneurysm (PRAA) repair using a uniform operative technique.\nEighty-one patients (mean age, 73 \u00b1 8 years, 19 [23.5%] women) underwent endovascular TAAA repair in a prospective trial using self-expanding covered stents connecting axially oriented, caudally directed cuffs to target aortic branches. Mean aneurysm diameter was 67 \u00b1 10 mm. Thirty-nine TAAA (48.1%) were Crawford type II, III, or V; 42 (51.9%) were type IV or pararenal. Thirty-three procedures (40.7%) were staged. The insertion approach was femoral for aortic components and brachial for branch components. Follow-up assessments were performed at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter.\nAll devices (n = 81) and branches (n = 306) were successfully inserted and deployed, with no conversions to open repair. Overall mortality was 6.2% (n = 5), including three perioperative (3.7%) and two late treatment-related deaths (2.5%). Permanent paraplegia occurred in three patients (3.7%), and transient paraplegia/paraparesis occurred in 16 (19.8%). Four patients (4.9%) required dialysis postoperatively, three permanently and one transiently. Women accounted for 67% of the paraplegia, 75% of the perioperative dialysis, and 60% of the perioperative or treatment-related deaths. During a mean follow-up of 21.2 months, no aneurysms ruptured, but four (4.9%) enlarged: two were successfully treated, one was unsuccessfully treated, and one was not treated. No late onset spinal cord ischemia symptoms developed. Of the five patients starting dialysis during follow-up, two resulted from renal branch occlusion. Sixteen branches occluded (nine renal, two celiac) or developed stenoses (four renal, one superior mesenteric artery), requiring stenting. Primary patency was 94.8%, and primary-assisted patency was 95.1%. Thirty-two patients (39.5%) underwent 42 reinterventions. Of 25 early reinterventions (\u2264 45 days), 10 were to treat access or insertion complications, and 5 were for endoleak. Of 17 late reinterventions, eight were for endoleak and five were for branch stenosis/occlusion. New endoleaks developed in two patients during follow-up. Overall, 73 of 81 patients (90.1%) were treated without procedure-related death, dialysis, paralysis, aneurysm rupture, or conversion to open repair.\nTotal endovascular TAAA/PRAA repair using caudally directed cuffs is safe, effective, and durable in the intermediate term. The most common form of late failure, renal artery occlusion, rarely had a clinically significant consequence (dialysis). The trend toward worse outcome in women needs further study.",

Overall mortality was 6.2% (n = 5), including three perioperative (3.7%) and two late treatment-related deaths (2.5%). Permanent paraplegia occurred in three patients (3.7%), and transient paraplegia/paraparesis occurred in 16 (19.8%). Four patients (4.9%) required dialysis postoperatively, three permanently and one transiently. Women accounted for 67% of the paraplegia, 75% of the perioperative dialysis, and 60% of the perioperative or treatment-related deaths. During a mean follow-up of 21.2 months, no aneurysms ruptured, but four (4.9%) enlarged: two were successfully treated, one was unsuccessfully treated, and one was not treated. No late onset spinal cord ischemia symptoms developed. Of the five patients starting dialysis during follow-up, two resulted from renal branch occlusion. Sixteen branches occluded (nine renal, two celiac) or developed stenoses (four renal, one superior mesenteric artery), requiring stenting. Primary patency was 94.8%, and primary-assisted patency was 95.1%. Thirty-two patients (39.5%) underwent 42 reinterventions. Of 25 early reinterventions (\u2264 45 days), 10 were to treat access or insertion complications, and 5 were for endoleak. Of 17 late reinterventions, eight were for endoleak and five were for branch stenosis/occlusion. New endoleaks developed in two patients during follow-up. Overall, 73 of 81 patients (90.1%) were treated without procedure-related death, dialysis, paralysis, aneurysm rupture, or conversion to open repair.",

    "abstract": "Patients having undergone femoropopliteal bypass surgery remain at significant risk of graft failure. Although antithrombotic therapy is of paramount importance in these patients, the effect of oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) on outcomes remains unresolved. We performed a randomized, prospective study to assess the impact of OAT plus clopidogrel vs dual antiplatelet therapy on peripheral vascular and systemic cardiovascular outcomes in patients who had undergone femoropopliteal bypass surgery.\nThree hundred forty-one patients who had undergone femoropopliteal surgery were enrolled and randomized: 173 patients received clopidogrel 75 mg/d plus OAT with warfarin (C + OAT), and 168 patients received dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel 75 mg/d plus aspirin 100 mg/d (C + acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]). Study end points were graft patency and the occurrence of severe peripheral arterial ischemia, and the incidence of bleeding episodes.\nFollow-up ranged from 4 to 9 years. The graft patency rate and the freedom from severe peripheral arterial ischemia was significantly higher in C + OAT group than in C + ASA group (P = .026 and .044, respectively, Cox-Mantel test). The linearized incidence of minor bleeding complications was significantly higher in C + OAT group than in C + ASA group (2.85% patient-years vs 1.37% patient-years; P = .03). The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events, including mortality, was found to be similar (P = .34) for both study groups.\nIn patients who have undergone femoropopliteal vascular surgery, combination therapy with clopidogrel plus warfarin is more effective than dual antiplatelet therapy in increasing graft patency and in reducing severe peripheral ischemia. These improvements are obtained at the expenses of an increase in the rate of minor anticoagulation-related complications.",

    "abstract": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is an independent risk factor for arteriosclerosis, but its role in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) expansion remains not completely verified. There are no data about the prognostic significance of rates of variation of the CRP levels in asymptomatic AAAs. This study investigated the association between plasma CRP levels and AAA diameter and assessed the relationship between the gradient of CRP levels and rates of expansion in asymptomatic AAAs.\nPlasma levels of high-sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) were measured using a high-sensitivity technique and AAA size was determined by computed tomography in 435 patients with asymptomatic AAAs followed up in our outpatient department.\nThe median hs-CRP level was 4.23 mg/L. The aorta diameter increased in the four groups of patients determined according to hs-CRP quartiles (35 \u00b1 2, 40 \u00b1 3, 49 \u00b1 4, and 58 \u00b1 5 mm; P = .01). The median rate of CRP level variation per year was 1.4 mg/L. Patients with an elevation >1.4 mg/L had an expansion rate of 4.8 mm vs 3.9 mm in those <1.4 mg/L (P < .01). The multivariate age-adjusted logistic model confirmed initial diameter and variation of CRP level were the only factors associated with expansion, with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 6.3 (3.1-7.5) and 3.4 (2.1-5.6).\nThese results confirm a statistical association between AAA diameter and hs-CRP plasma levels. This cohort study corroborates this potential causal association and contributes information about the value of the hs-CRP plasma level gradient as a marker of disease progression and rate of expansion.",

    "abstract": "As branched/fenestrated endografts expand endovascular options for juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (JAAAs), long-term durability will be compared to that of open JAAA repair, which has not been documented in large contemporary series. The goal of this study was to assess the late clinical and anatomic outcomes after open JAAA repair.\nFrom July 2001 to December 2007, 199 patients underwent open elective JAAA repair, as defined by a need for suprarenal clamping. End points included perioperative and late survival, long-term follow-up of renal function, and freedom from graft-related complications. Factors predictive of survival were determined by multivariate analysis.\nThe mean patient age was 74 years, 71% were men, and 20% had baseline renal insufficiency (Cr >1.5). Thirty-seven renal artery bypasses, for anatomic necessity or ostial stenosis, were performed in 36 patients. Overall 30-day mortality was 2.5%. Four patients (2.0%) required early dialysis; one patient recovered by discharge. Two additional patients progressed to dialysis over long-term follow-up. There was one graft infection involving one limb of a bifurcated graft. Surveillance imaging was obtained in 101 patients (72% of survivors) at a mean follow-up of 41 \u00b1 28 months. Renal artery occlusion occurred in four patients (3% of imaged renal arteries; one native/three grafts). Two patients (2.0%) had aneurysmal degeneration of the aorta either proximal or distal to the repaired segment, but there were no anastomotic pseudoaneurysms. Remote aneurysms were found in 29 patients (29% of imaged patients), 14 of whom had descending thoracic aneurysm or TAAA. Four patients underwent subsequent thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR). Actuarial survival was 74 \u00b1 3.3% at 5 years. Negative predictors of survival included increasing age at the time of operation (relative risk [RR], 1.05; P = .01), steroid use (RR, 2.20; P = .001), and elevated preoperative creatinine (RR, 1.73; P = .02).\nOpen JAAA repair yields excellent long-term anatomic durability and preserves renal function. Perioperative renal insufficiency occurs in 8.5% of patients, but few of them progress to dialysis. Graft-related complications are rare (2% at 40 months); however, axial imaging revealed descending thoracic aneurysms in 14% of imaged patients, making continued surveillance for remote aneurysms prudent. These data provide a benchmark against which fenestrated/branched endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) outcomes can be compared.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the quality and readability of patient information for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) on the World Wide Web, as accessed from the United Kingdom.\nWeb sites returned by a simple Web search using the three largest search engines by market share were objectively and subjectively assessed for quality and readability. The Internet search engines Google, Yahoo!, and Bing were interrogated for the term \"abdominal aortic aneurysm\" and the first 50 hits screened. Organization type and Health on the Net status were recorded. Each unique site containing AAA information was scored for quality using the University of Michigan Consumer Health Web site Evaluation Checklist by two authors, and readability was calculated using the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) score. Subjective content assessment was also undertaken.\nOf 150 hits, 112 were relevant, with 55 unique sites for assessment. Overall, the FRE score was 39 (range, 29-47) and the Michigan score was 36 (range, 25-56), with good interobserver agreement (r(s) = 0.83; P = .01). Michigan and FRE scores were poorly correlated (r(s) = 0.064; P = .6). Sites containing discussion on the merits of endovascular/open repair and the concept of an intervention threshold had the highest Michigan scores (58.5 [50-59.75] vs 28 [13-36.5]; P < .001). Search engine ranking, Health on the Net status, country of origin, and organization type did not affect quality or readability.\nThe current quality and readability of online patient information for AAAs is poor and requires significant improvement. Clinicians treating patients with AAAs should be aware of the limitations of the online \"lay literature.\"",

    "abstract": "Intraoperative imaging of intravascular thrombi is limited by the inability of visible light to penetrate thick-walled vessels. Near-infrared (NIR) light has relatively high tissue penetration and low autofluorescence and scatter, offering significant advantages. We hypothesized that the development of 700-nm NIR fluorophores for platelet labeling, in conjunction with existing 800-nm NIR fluorophores, would permit simultaneous and separable quantitation of intravascular thrombi and measurement of the antiplatelet effect of drugs.\nWe synthesized a series of lipophilic, cationic, polymethine indocyanine dyes (MHI-86, 94, 106, and 114) that emit at approximately 700 nm. Platelet uptake was optimized in vitro and the bioactivity and blood half-life of labeled platelets was characterized in vitro and in vivo. FeCl(3)-induced injury of the femoral arteries and intravascular thrombus formation was performed in 35-kg Yorkshire pigs. A combination of 700-nm and 800-nm NIR fluorophore-labeled platelets was used in conjunction with the fluorescence-assisted resection and exploration imaging system to image and quantify the antiplatelet effect of cilostazol and acetylsalicylic acid.\nMHI-114 was incorporated at nearly 4.1 \u00d7 10(6) molecules per platelet without affecting platelet function. When infused into pigs, the signal-to-background ratio of MHI-114-labeled platelets exhibited a blood half-life of 16.4 \u00b1 2.2 (mean \u00b1 SEM; n = 3) minute and generated a signal-to-background ratio of 2.5 \u00b1 0.5 (mean \u00b1 SEM; n = 3) at the site of thrombi. Using dual-NIR-labeled platelet populations, cilostazol and acetylsalicylic acid were found to cause a reduction in platelet incorporation into thrombi of 51 \u00b1 2% and 10 \u00b1 1% (mean \u00b1 SEM; n = 3), respectively, relative to vehicle-only treated control thrombi.\nNew platelet-avid 700-nm NIR fluorophores permit simultaneous two-wavelength NIR fluorescence imaging and quantitation of intravascular thrombi in intact vessels approaching the size of humans and can be used to study the antiplatelet effect of drugs.",

    "abstract": "An ultrasound screening program for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in men began in Gloucestershire in 1990 and has been running for 20 years. This report examines the workload and results.\nWe reviewed the screening database for attendance and outcome records from AAA surgery in Gloucestershire and postmortem and death certificate results looking for men who died from ruptured AAAs in the screening cohort. The setting was an AAA screening program in the county of Gloucestershire, UK. Men aged 65 were invited by year of birth to attend for an ultrasound screening for AAAs. Men with an aorta <2.6 cm were reassured and discharged; men with an aorta between 2.6 cm and 5.4 cm were offered follow-up surveillance; men with an aorta >5.4 cm were considered for intervention. We analyzed attendance rates, screening and surveillance outcomes, and intervention rates and outcomes over the 20 years of the study.\nSome 61,982 men were invited, and 52,690 attended for screening (85% attendance). At first scan, 50,130 men (95.14%) had an aortic diameter <2.6 cm in diameter and were reassured and discharged; 148 men (0.28%) had an AAA >5.4 cm in diameter and were referred for possible treatment; 2412 (4.57%) had an aortic diameter between 2.6 and 5.4 cm and entered a program of ultrasound surveillance. The overall mean aortic diameter on initial scan fell from 2.1 cm to 1.7 cm during the study (reduction 0.015 cm/y, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0144-0.0156 cm/y; P < .0001). Some 631 patients with AAAs had intervention treatment with a perioperative mortality rate of 3.9%; during the same interval, 372 AAAs detected incidentally were treated, with a mortality rate of 6.7%. The number of ruptured AAAs treated annually in Gloucestershire fell during the study (\u03c7(2) for trend = 18.31, df = 1; P < .0001).\nScreening reduced the number of ruptured AAAs in Gloucestershire during the 20 years of the program. There has been a significant reduction of men with an abnormal aorta, as the mean aortic diameter of the 65-year-old male has reduced over 20 years.",

    "abstract": "Thermal damage to peripheral nerves is a known complication of endovenous thermal ablation (EVA) of the small saphenous vein (SSV). Therefore, the main objective of this anatomic study was to define a safe zone in the lower leg where EVA of the SSV can be performed safely.\nThe anatomy of the SSV and adjacent nerves was studied in 20 embalmed human specimens. The absolute distances between the SSV and the sural nerve (SN) (closest/nearest branch) were measured over the complete length of the leg (>120 data points per leg), and the presence of the interlaying deep fascia was mapped. The distance between the SSV and the tibial nerve (TN) and the common peroneal nerve was assessed. A new analysis method, computer-assisted surgical anatomy mapping, was used to visualize the gathered data.\nThe distance between the SSV and the SN was highly variable. In the proximal one-third of the lower leg, the distance between the vein and the nerve was <5 mm in 70% of the legs. In 95%, the deep fascia was present between the SSV and the SN. In the distal two-thirds of the lower leg, the distance between the vein and the nerve was <5 mm in 90% of the legs. The deep fascia was present between both structures in 15%. In 19 legs, the SN partially ran beneath the deep fascia. In the saphenopopliteal region, the average shortest distance between the SSV and the TN was 4.4 mm. In 20%, the distance was <1 mm. The average, shortest distance between the SSV and the common peroneal nerve was 14.2 mm. The distance was <1 mm in one leg.\nAt the saphenopopliteal region, the TN is at risk during EVA. In the distal two-thirds of the lower leg, the SN is at risk for (thermal) damage due to the small distance to the SSV and the absence of the deep fascia between both structures. The proximal one-third of the lower leg is the optimal region for EVA of the SSV to avoid nerve damage; the fascia between the SSV and the SN is a natural barrier in this region that could preclude (thermal) damage to the nerve.",

    "abstract": "Although endovascular therapy for complex lesions in the lower limbs has frequently achieved successful recanalization by improvement of techniques and devices, chronic total occlusion in the femoropopliteal arterial segment still remains a challenge for treatment by endovascular therapy. We investigated the efficacy and safety of endovascular therapy for chronic total occlusion in the femoropopliteal arterial segment guided by a hand-carried ultrasound (HCUS) device and supported by a retrograde microcatheter.\nWe attempted endovascular therapy for chronic total occlusion lesions in the femoropopliteal arterial segment using a protocol involving a dual-access procedure using the HCUS device and a retrograde 2.7F microcatheter from January 2008 to June 2010. We evaluated the success rate, complications, and clinical outcomes, including the ankle-brachial index (ABI) and primary and secondary patency.\nSuccess was achieved in 18 of 19 patients (95%), without major complications (only two small hematomas). The HCUS device was useful in reducing the personnel and space requirements, radiation exposure, and the required amount of contrast agent. The retrograde flexible 2.7F microcatheter was also useful in achieving successful recanalization and contributed to reducing puncture-related complications. The ABI was significantly improved, from 0.56 \u00b1 0.12 to 0.81 \u00b1 0.11 at 1 year (P < .01) and this effect remained stable. Primary and secondary patency was 63% and 89%, respectively, at 3 years.\nHCUS-guided and retrograde 2.7F microcatheter-supported endovascular therapy for chronic total occlusion lesions of the femoropopliteal arterial segment can achieve a favorable clinical outcome without major complications.",

We herein present a case of transmural migration of a pedicle screw into the descending thoracic aorta, which was revealed incidentally by computed tomography scan after almost 4 years of hardware implantation. Approximately 75% of the pedicle screw was exposed to the bloodstream, and was successfully removed using endovascular segmental exclusion to avoid aortic cross-clamping and an open approach via left thoracotomy. This case illustrates the successful repair of an iatrogenic aortic injury using a hybrid technique.",

    "abstract": "To review the evolution of traumatic thoracic aortic injury (TTAI) treatment at a single institution.\nRetrospective analysis of all patients included in an institutional trauma registry and vascular surgery database who underwent treatment of TTAI between January 1999 and January 2011.\nNinety-one patients (69 males) were treated for TTAI. The mean age was 38.5 years (range, 16-79 years). Forty-one patients underwent open repair (OR) and 50 thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR), 37 with thoracic stent grafts (TSG) alone, 11 with infrarenal aortic extender cuffs (AEC), and two with a combination of TSG and AEC. OR was performed exclusively until 2004; the last one was performed in January 2007. All TTAIs have since been treated with TEVAR. The left subclavian artery (LSA) was fully covered in 10 patients (20%) and partially covered in eight patients, with revascularization in only two cases. The use of AEC and avoidance of LSA coverage increased after 2007. Baseline characteristics and injury severity scores were similar between groups. The mortality rate was higher in the OR group (19.5% vs 6.0%; P = .06), although it did not reach statistical significance. The overall incidence of morbidities was similar between the two groups (42% OR vs 50% TEVAR). Two patients developed paraplegia (4.4%) after OR compared with none after TEVAR. In the TEVAR group, a pseudoaneurysm, an iliac artery thrombosis, and a retroperitoneal hematoma developed in one patient each. Overall, eight patients (16%) developed stent graft-related complications (SRC), with two developing early (within 30 days) complications. All complications were related to poor apposition, requiring 10 reinterventions. Four patients underwent open conversions with no mortality. Nine out of 10 SRCs were associated with the use of thoracic stent graft malapposition. No patient treated with AEC had endoleaks or SRC.\nTEVAR for TTAI has superior survival outcomes and has replaced OR. SRC requiring reintervention is associated with malapposition and the use of TSG. Until TTAI-specific endografts become available, use of AEC may minimize malapposition and reduce reinterventions. Routine overstenting of the LSA is not necessary and may increase SRC.",

    "abstract": "The proximal aortic neck is one of the limiting factors for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and represents a crucial factor for success or failure of the procedure. In contrast to open surgery, where a clamp can be placed suprarenally but the repair performed infrarenally, EVAR requires a good infrarenal neck for durable fixation and seal. In a high-risk surgical 79-year-old patient with juxtarenal aortic aneurysm with unsuitable infrarenal neck, a hybrid procedure was chosen: juxtarenal aortic banding and EVAR. The banding allowed a successful EVAR by reshaping the juxtarenal aneurysmal aortic segment, hence converting a previously untreatable anatomy into a treatable one.",

    "abstract": "Despite its presumed effectiveness and clinical use, the physiology of selective visceral perfusion combined with distal aortic perfusion during open thoracoabdominal aortic surgery has not been characterized. Thus, the aim of this study was to establish a translatable model of thoracic aortic-clamping to assess the effect of selective visceral perfusion with added distal aortic perfusion on local intestinal macrohemodynamics and microhemodynamics, intestinal histopathology, and markers of inflammation and intestinal damage.\nA thoracolaparotomy was performed in 15 pigs, and the aorta was exposed, including the origins of celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery. The animals were divided into three cohorts: control (I), thoracic aortic cross-clamping (II), and thoracic aortic cross-clamping with selective visceral perfusion plus distal aortic perfusion using extracorporeal circulation (III). Macrocirculatory and microcirculatory blood flow was assessed by transit time ultrasound volume flow measurements and fluorescent microspheres. Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury was determined by the analysis of perioperative intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (IFABP) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels and correlated with histopathologic changes.\nSevere intestinal tissue injury and an inflammatory response were observed in cohort II compared with cohort III for IL-8 (38.2 vs 3.56 pg/mL; P = .04). The procedure in cohort III resulted in a flow and pressure-associated intestinal hypoperfusion compared with cohort I in the superior mesenteric artery (mean blood pressure, 24.1 \u00b1 10.4 vs 67.2 \u00b1 7.4 mm Hg; P < .0001; mean flow rates: 353.3 \u00b1 133.8 vs 961.7 \u00b1 310.8 mL/min; P < .0001). This was paralleled in cohort III vs cohort I by a significant mucosal injury (IFABP, 713 \u00b1 307.1 vs 170 \u00b1 115.4 pg/mL; P = .014) despite a profound recruitment of intestinal microcirculation (338% \u00b1 206.7% vs 135% \u00b1 123.7%; P = .05).\nThis study reports a novel large-animal model of thoracic aortic cross-clamping that allows the study of visceral perfusion strategies. However, we demonstrated with IL-8 and IFABP measurements that thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgery with selective visceral perfusion and distal aortic perfusion is superior to the clamp-and-sew technique, even though small intestinal tissue damage cannot be completely avoided by selective visceral perfusion and distal aortic perfusion. In any case, this model seems to be a platform to evaluate and optimize measures for gut wall protection.",

    "abstract": "Although duplex vein mapping (DVM) of the great saphenous vein (GSV) is common practice, there is no level I evidence for its application. Our prospective randomized trial studied the effect of preoperative DVM in infrainguinal bypass surgery.\nConsecutive patients undergoing primary bypass grafting were prospectively randomized for DVM of the GSV (group A) or no DMV of the GSV (group B) before surgery. Society for Vascular Surgery reporting standards were applied.\nFrom December 2009 to December 2010, 103 patients were enrolled: 51 (group A) underwent DVM of the GSV, and 52 (group B) did not. Group A and group B not differ statistically in age (72.8 vs 71.1 years), sex (women, 29.4% vs 34.6%), cardiovascular risk factors, body mass index (25.9 vs 26.1 kg/m(2)), bypass anatomy, and runoff. Group A and B had equal operative time (151.4 vs 151.1 minutes), incisional length (39.4 vs 39.9 cm), and secondary bypass patency at 30 days (96.1% vs 96.2%; P = .49). Conduit issues resulted in six intraoperative changes of the operative plan in group B vs none in group A (P = .014). Median postoperative length of stay was comparable in both groups (P = .18). Surgical site infections (SSIs) were classified (in group A vs B) as minor (23.5% vs 23.1%; P = 1.0) and major (1.9% vs 21.2%; P = .004). Readmissions due to SSIs were 3.9% in group A vs 19.2% in group B (P = .028). Two patients in group B died after complications of SSIs. Multivariate analysis identified preoperative DVM as the only significant factor influencing the development of major SSI (P = .0038).\nRoutine DVM should be recommended for infrainguinal bypass surgery. The study found that preoperative DVM significantly avoids unnecessary surgical exploration, development of major SSI, and reduces frequency of readmissions for SSI treatment.",

A 62-year-old man with a right subclavian artery aneurysm had had a history of bird hunting using a shotgun that impacted substantially against his right clavicula and shoulder weekly for >20 years. The patient underwent open repair with partial sternotomy and distal balloon control. The aneurysmal sac was resected, and the right subclavian artery was reconstructed with a primary end-to-end anastomosis. Histopathologic examination of the resected aneurysmal wall revealed that all three layers of the arterial wall were comparatively intact, with fibrosis and lipid deposition in the intima and in various degrees of degeneration in the media, suggesting a true aneurysm.",

    "abstract": "Despite multiple studies over more than 3 decades, there still is no consensus about the influence of anesthesia type on postoperative outcomes following carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The objective of this study was to investigate whether anesthesia type, either general anesthesia (GA) or regional anesthesia (RA), independently contributes to the risk of postoperative cardiovascular complications or death using the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database.\nRetrospective analysis of elective cases of CEA from 2005 through 2009 was performed. A propensity score model using 45 covariates, including demographic factors, comorbidities, stroke history, measures of general health, and laboratory values, was used to adjust for bias and to determine the independent influence of anesthesia type on postoperative stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and death.\nOf 26,070 cases listed in the ACS NSQIP database, GA and RA were used in 22,054 (84.6%) and 4016 (15.4%) cases, respectively. Postoperative stroke, MI, and death occurred in 360 (1.63%), 133 (0.6%), and 154 (0.70%) patients of the GA group, respectively, and in 58 (1.44%), 11 (0.27%), and 27 (0.67%) patients of the RA group, respectively. Stratification by propensity score quintile and adjustment for covariates demonstrated GA to be a significant risk factor for postoperative MI with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) of 2.18 (95% CI, 1.17-4.04), P = .01 in the entire study population. The OR for MI was 5.41 (95% CI, 1.32-22.16; P = .019) in the subgroup of patients with preoperative neurologic symptoms, and 1.44 (95% CI, 0.71-2.90; P = .31) in the subgroup of patients without preoperative neurologic symptoms.\nThis analysis of a large, prospectively collected and validated multicenter database indicates that GA for CEA is an independent risk factor for postoperative MI, particularly in patients with preoperative neurologic symptoms.",

Among these, 926 (77%) were aged <80 years, and 274 (23%) were aged \u2265 80 years. Quality of life was assessed using composite EuroQoL 5-Dimensions Questionnaire index scores.\nGender was unequally distributed, with more female patients among the octogenarians (P = .043). Octogenarians had a significantly higher American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (P < .001) and differed significantly in baseline risk factors. The younger cohort was more likely to smoke (P < .001) and be alcoholics (P = .005). Octogenarians had larger aortic aneurysm (P = .010) and left iliac artery diameters (P = .017) and greater infrarenal neck angulation (P = .01). The technical success rate was >99% for both cohorts. Octogenarians were more often operated on under general anesthesia (P = .028), had a longer procedure duration (P = .001), and an increased length of hospitalization; both total (P < .001) and postprocedure (P < .001). All-cause mortality and major adverse event rates were similar in the two groups (P = .835 and P = .186, respectively). There was no difference in the number of secondary endovascular procedures or aneurysm rupture at 30 days. At discharge, both groups had reduced health status dimensions, except anxiety/depression, when compared with baseline. At 30 days, the octogenarian group had a lower composite EuroQoL 5-Dimensions Questionnaire index compared with the younger group, indicating a slower recovery (0.83 \u00b1 0.20 vs 0.87 \u00b1 0.16; P = .003).\nOctogenarians can be safely treated using the Endurant stent graft with a high technical rate of success, low perioperative mortality, and no reduction in quality of life. Octogenarians did, however, appear to recover more slowly than younger patients with respect to certain quality of life components. Long-term data are needed to confirm these results.",

    "abstract": "Cold storage is used to preserve tissue for later transplantation. There is particular interest in prolonging cold storage time for transplantation purposes. To date, the mechanisms that contribute to vascular dysfunction in response to cold storage are poorly understood. The present study aims to characterize cold storage injury of blood vessels on functional and molecular levels.\nTo assess vessel function of mouse aorta, isometric force measurements were performed in a Mulvany myograph after cold storage at 4\u00b0C for various intervals. Morphologic changes were judged by histologic analysis of aortic cross-sections. To characterize cold storage-induced alterations on RNA levels, microarray analysis with subsequent polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed.\nCold storage for 2 days revealed significant impairment of vessel function with respect to potassium-induced vessel tone development and acetylcholine-induced vessel relaxation. Detailed analysis of acetylcholine-mediated vascular response using specific pharmacologic blockers revealed that calcium-activated potassium channels seem to be impaired after 2 days of cold storage. At this point, no severe histologic changes (eg, elastic fiber disruption) were visible. RNA expression of 24 genes was significantly changed due to cold storage even after 2 hours. These include genes associated with vessel tone development (prostaglandin E(3) receptor), cardiovascular function (adiponectin), electron transport chain (uncoupling protein 1), or calcium signaling (protein kinase A regulatory subunit 2b).\nLong-term cold storage impairs vascular function, especially with respect to potassium signaling by calcium-dependent potassium channels. Microarray analysis confirmed impairment of pathways that are involved in calcium signaling and vascular function. Furthermore, various genes were significantly altered even after 2 hours, significantly before functional impairment was observed.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the influence of significant aneurysm neck thrombus in clinical and morphologic outcomes after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nThe patient population was derived from a prospective EVAR database from two university institutions in The Netherlands from 2004 to 2008. Patients with significant thrombus in the neck (>2 mm in thickness in at least >25% of circumference) were identified as the thrombus group and were compared with the remaining patients without neck thrombus (no-thrombus group), treated within the same period. The primary end point was clinical success. Secondary end points included technical success and rates of decline in renal function. Detailed morphologic analysis of the aortic neck was serially performed for the thrombus group patients to assess changes in thrombus volume.\nThe study included 389 patients: 43 (39 men; mean age of 72.3 years) met the criteria for the thrombus group; of these, 31 (72%) had significant thrombus in >50% of the aortic neck circumference, and 8 (19%) had circumferential thrombus >2-mm thick. Median follow-up was 3.34 years (interquartile range, 2.67-4.72). The estimated 5-year clinical success rate was 74% for the thrombus group and 62% for the no-thrombus group (P = .23). Endograft migration was more frequent in the thrombus group (P = .02). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed a significant association between migration and use of a device without active fixation (hazard ratio, 4.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-18.23; P = .018) but not with the presence of neck thrombus (P = .063). No differences were found in the rates of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate at 30 days and during follow-up between the thrombus and no-thrombus groups. The thrombus volume in the first 10 mm of aortic neck was progressively reduced over time until it was not measurable in most patients, resulting in complete circular attachment of the endograft to the vessel wall.\nOur findings suggest that the presence of aneurysm neck thrombus has no significant influence on short-term and midterm EVAR results.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the 1-year patency rates of heparin-bonded covered stents in the treatment of chronic occlusive disease of the superficial femoral artery (SFA).\nAll patients treated with a heparin-bonded endograft between April 2009 and October 2010 for chronic occlusive disease of the SFA were prospectively gathered in a database and retrospectively analyzed. Primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency rates, assessed by ultrasound scanning, were analyzed at 1-year, as were the complication rates and mortality.\nA total of 56 limbs were treated with a heparin-bonded covered stent in 53 patients for chronic ischemia Rutherford category 3 (n = 36), 4 (n = 5), 5 (n = 11), and 6 (n = 1). Lesions were classified as TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC)-2-B (n = 9), C (n = 14), and D (n = 33), and the mean treated lesion length was 18.5 \u00b1 7.7 cm. Postoperative complications occurred in 7.5%, including hematoma (n = 1), edema (n = 1), pneumonia (n = 1), and urinary retention (n = 1), and the 30-day mortality rate was 0%.

Complete spontaneous neurologic recovery is possible and was observed in the present case 3 hours after symptom onset. Spontaneous spinal cord reperfusion after acute type B dissection was probably due to two main mechanisms. Reperfusion of false lumen and collateral vascular network recruitment, recently confirmed by anatomic animal studies, serve as potential explanations. Favorable evolution of acute paraplegia after aortic dissection exists, but prognosis is uncertain, probably due to individual variable anatomic distribution of spinal cord blood supply.",

    "abstract": "We performed a systematic review of the current literature to analyze the immediate and follow-up results of fenestrated endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (F-EVAR) in patients with pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).\nThe Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched to identify all studies reporting F-EVAR of pararenal AAAs published between January 2000 and May 2011. Two independent observers selected studies for inclusion, assessed the quality of the included studies, and performed the data extraction. Studies were selected based on specific predefined criteria. Outcomes were technical success (successfully completed procedure with endograft patency, preservation of target vessels, and no evidence of type I or III endoleak at postprocedural imaging), 30-day mortality, all-cause mortality, branch vessel patency, renal impairment, and secondary interventions. Between-study heterogeneity was calculated using I(2) statistics. Pooled estimates were calculated using a fixed-effects (I(2) <25%) or a random-effects (I(2) >25% to <50%) model.\nNine studies were included reporting 629 patients who underwent F-EVAR for a pararenal AAA, of which 1622 target vessels were incorporated in an endograft design. Between-study heterogeneity was \u2264 41% for all outcomes. The pooled estimate (95% confidence interval [CI] was 90.4% (87.7%-92.5%) for technical success, 2.1% (1.2%-3.7%) for 30-day mortality, and 16% (12.5%-20.4%) for all-cause mortality. Follow-up was 15 to 25 months. The pooled estimate (95% CI) during follow-up was 93.2% (90.4%-95.3%) for branch vessel patency, 22.2% (16%-30.1%) for renal impairment, and 17.8% (13.5%-22.6%) for secondary interventions.\nPromising immediate and midterm results (up to 2 years) support F-EVAR as a feasible, safe, and effective treatment in a relatively high-risk cohort of patients with pararenal AAAs.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular treatment of superficial femoral artery (SFA) lesions is a well-established practice. The repercussions of failed SFA interventions are unclear. Our goal was to review the efficacy of SFA stenting and define negative effects of its failure.\nA retrospective chart review was conducted from January 2007 to January 2010 that identified 42 limbs in 39 patients that underwent SFA stenting. Follow-up ankle-brachial index and a duplex ultrasound scan was performed at routine intervals.\nMean patient age was 68 years (range, 43-88 years); there were 22 men (56%) and 17 women (44%). Intervention indication was claudication in 15 patients (36%), rest pain in seven patients (17%), and tissue loss in 19 patients (45%). There were 15 patients (36%) with TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) A, nine patients (21%) with TASC B, five patients (12%) with TASC C, and 13 patients (31%) with TASC D lesions. The majority of lesions intervened on were the first attempt at revascularization. Three stents (7.7%) occluded within 30 days. One-year primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency rates were 24%, 44%, and 51%, respectively. Limb salvage was 93% during follow-up. Seventeen interventions failed (40%) at 1 year. Of these, seven patients (41%) developed claudication, seven patients (41%) developed ischemic rest pain, and three patients (18%) were asymptomatic. During follow-up, three patients (7.7%) required bypass and three patients (7.7%) major amputation, one after failed bypass. All limbs requiring bypass or amputation had TASC C/D lesions. Thirty-day and 1-year mortality was 2.6% and 10.3%, respectively.\nInterventions performed for TASC C/D lesions are more likely to fail and more likely to lead to bypass or amputation. Interventions performed for TASC C/D lesions that fail have a negative impact on limb salvage. This should be considered when performing stenting of advanced SFA lesions.",

    "abstract": "This meta-analysis was initiated to assess the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation therapy for adult patients with isolated calf vein deep venous thrombosis (DVT).\nWe searched MEDLINE (1950-October 2010), the Cochrane Library (1993-October 2010), trial registries, meeting abstracts, and selected references, using no limits. Included studies compared the results of anticoagulation (vitamin K antagonist or therapeutic heparin) for a minimum of 30 days vs the results of no anticoagulation in adults with calf vein DVT proved by ultrasound imaging or venograph who were monitored for at least 30 days. Two independent reviewers extracted data using a piloted standardized form. Methodologic quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort and case-control studies. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer. Authors were contacted for additional information if necessary. Outcomes were pooled using Peto fixed-effects models.\nOf 2328 studies identified, two RCTs and six cohorts (126 patients treated with anticoagulation and 328 controls) met selection criteria. The methodologic quality of most studies was poor. Pulmonary embolism (PE; odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.77; P = .03) and thrombus propagation (odds ratio, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.62; P = .04) were significantly less frequent in those who received anticoagulation. Significant heterogeneity existed in studies reporting mortality rates, but these demonstrated a trend toward fewer deaths with anticoagulation. When limited to randomized trials, the protective effect of anticoagulation for PE was no longer statistically significant, but the benefit for preventing thrombus progression persisted. Adverse events such as bleeding were sparsely reported but favored controls (P = .65).\nOur review suggests that anticoagulation therapy for calf vein DVT may decrease the incidence of PE and thrombus propagation. However, due to poor methodologic quality and few events among included studies for PE, this finding is not robust. Thrombus propagation appears reduced with anticoagulation treatment. A rigorous RCT will assist in treatment decisions for calf vein DVT.",

    "abstract": "We report the 5-year outcomes of thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) using the Medtronic Vascular Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, Calif) in patients considered low or moderate risk for open surgical repair.\nThe Evaluation of the Medtronic Vascular Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System for the Treatment of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms (VALOR) trial was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, pivotal study conducted at 38 U.S. sites. Between December 2003 and June 2005, VALOR enrolled 195 patients who were low or moderate risk (0, 1, and 2) per the modified Society for Vascular Surgery and American Association for Vascular Surgery criteria. The patients had fusiform thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) and/or focal saccular TAAs/penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers. Standard follow-up interval examinations were conducted at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter.\nOver the 5-year follow-up, 76 deaths occurred (43.9%). Freedom from all-cause mortality was 83.9% at 1 year and 58.5% at 5 years. Most deaths were due to cardiac, pulmonary or cancer-related causes. Freedom from aneurysm-related mortality (ARM) was 96.9% at 1 year and 96.1% at 5 years. There was only 1 case of ARM after the first year of follow-up. Over the 5-year follow-up period, four patients were converted to open surgery and four patients experienced aneurysm rupture. The 5-year freedom from aneurysm rupture was 97.1% and the 5-year freedom from conversion to surgery was 97.1%. The incidence of stent graft migration (>10 mm) was \u2264 1.8% in each year of follow-up. The rate of type I endoleak was 4.6% at 1 month, 6.3% from 1 month to 1 year, and 3.8% during year 5. The rate of type III endoleak was 1.3% at 1 month, 1.9% from 1 month to 1 year, and 1.9% during year 5. Through 5 years, 28 patients (14.4%) underwent 31 additional endovascular procedures on the original target lesion. The 5-year freedom from secondary endovascular procedures was 81.5%.\nThrough 5-year follow-up in patients who were candidates for open surgical repair, TEVAR using the Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System has demonstrated sustained protection from ARM, aneurysm rupture, and conversion to surgery, and durable stent graft performance. Close patient follow-up remains essential after TEVAR.",

We prospectively investigated whether subclinical microembolization seen on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) leads to cognitive deficits in patients undergoing carotid revascularization procedures.\nPatients undergoing carotid interventions and eligible for MRI scanning were recruited. Among 247 patients who received preoperative and postoperative MRI evaluations, 51 also completed neuropsychologic testing before and at 1 month after their procedure. Cognitive evaluation included the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) for memory evaluation and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for general cognitive impairment screening.\nThe 51 patients (all men), comprising 16 with carotid artery stenting (CAS) and 35 with carotid endarterectomy (CEA), were a mean age of 71 years (range, 54-89 years). Among them, 27 patients (53%) were symptomatic preoperatively, including 11 who had prior stroke and 16 who had prior preoperative transient ischemic attack symptoms. Most patients had significant medical comorbidities, including hypertension (96%), diabetes (31.3%), coronary artery disease (47%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (15.7%). Two patients (4%) had prior ipsilateral CEA and eight had contralateral carotid occlusion (15.7%). Memory decline evident on RAVLT was identified in eight CAS patients and 13 CEA patients. Eleven patients had evidence of procedure-related microemboli. Although there was no significant difference in baseline cognitive function or memory change between the CEA and CAS cohorts, the CAS cohort had a significantly higher incidence of microembolic lesions. Multivariate regression analysis showed that procedure-related microembolization was associated with memory decline (P = .016) as evident by change in RAVLT. A history of neurologic symptoms was significantly associated with poor baseline cognitive function (MMSE; P = .03) and overall cognitive deterioration (change in MMSE; P = .026), as determined by Wilcoxon rank sum test and linear regression analysis, respectively.\nAlthough CEA and CAS are effective in stroke prevention, with minimal neurologic complication, neurocognitive effects remain uncertain. Procedure-associated microembolization and pre-existing neurologic symptoms are associated with poor baseline cognitive function and memory decline after the procedures. Further comprehensive cognitive evaluation to determine the benefit of carotid interventions is warranted.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify any gender-associated differences in the percutaneous treatment of infrageniculate lesions in individuals with chronic critical limb ischemia.\nA retrospective chart review was performed on 112 index tibial lesions in 81 consecutive patients operated on from January 2005 to February 2011. All patients were treated for critical limb ischemia-defined as rest pain or tissue loss. Patient demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, vascular studies, lesion characteristics, procedures, and postoperative complications were entered into a database for review. Patients were evaluated for primary patency, secondary patency, limb salvage, and mortality rates.\nSixty-three index tibial lesions were treated percutaneously in 43 women, compared to 49 lesions in 38 men. There was a trend toward increased cardiac disease (65.8% men vs 44.2% women; P = .052) and smoking (52.6% men vs 32.6% women; P = .070) in men. Men were more likely than women to have TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) C and D lesions (83.7% vs 65.1%; P = .023) and to be treated for total occlusion (44.9% vs 25.4%; P = .031). There were no significant gender-related differences in length of stay or postoperative complications. Women had statistically better primary patency rates than men at 12 and 24 months (77.5% \u00b1 6.9% and 72.9% \u00b1 7.8% in women vs 58.7% \u00b1 9.3% and 45.2% \u00b1 9.9% in men; P = .032). Women also had statistically better secondary patency rates than men at 12 and 24 months (90.4% \u00b1 4.8% and 85.1% \u00b1 6.8% in women vs 76.0% \u00b1 8.1% and 58.5% \u00b1 10.8% in men; P = .028). Female gender remained an independent predictor of superior patency even after controlling for gender-related differences in TASC grade. There were no significant differences in limb salvage rates at 12 and 24 months (92.1% \u00b1 4.4% and 85.0% \u00b1 7.9% in women vs 88.3% \u00b1 6.4% and 83.4% \u00b1 7.7% in men; P = .985). Overall survival rates were similar (59.8% \u00b1 7.6% for women and 68.0% \u00b1 8.1% for men at 24 months; P = .351).\nPercutaneous intervention may be an equally effective or better treatment option for women with chronic limb ischemia and tibial disease when compared to men. In this study, male gender was an independent predictor of poorer primary and secondary patency rates after infrageniculate intervention. There were no differences in postoperative wound complications between genders. Endovascular procedures may lessen the gap in gender-related treatment outcomes and postoperative complications seen after open arterial reconstructions.",

Although CAS outcomes have improved during the last decade, the associated stroke rate remains higher when compared with carotid endarterectomy. Therefore, the pivotal role of embolic protection devices (EPDs) in minimizing stroke risk cannot be underestimated as a vital component of CAS.

    "abstract": "Fenestrated endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (f-EVAR) of juxtarenal aneurysms requiring cannulation of the superior mesenteric artery and renal arteries is technically challenging, has a long operating time, and requires bilateral large-caliber sheath insertion into the femoral arteries. Consequently, the risk of lower limb ischemia and subsequent reperfusion injury is increased. We describe the use of an adjunct temporary axillobifemoral bypass graft (TABFBG) for f-EVAR and propose that it be used as a strategy to avoid ischemia-reperfusion injury in patients anticipated as being at increased risk.\nConsecutive patients from a tertiary referral center undergoing f-EVAR, between October 2008 and August 2011, were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with lower limb arterial occlusive disease and those with difficult anatomy had an adjunct TABFBG.\nAll patients presenting with a juxtarenal aortic aneurysm were treated endovascularly, regardless of aneurysm anatomy and technical difficulties. There were 37 patients without TABFBG (group 1) and 27 with TABFBG (group 2). No patients required open conversion. Sex and age were not significantly different between the groups. The median ankle-brachial pressure index was significantly higher in group 1 (P=.0001). The groups had similar median blood loss, percentage of target vessel cannulation, and median stay in the intensive therapy unit. Morbidities were similar in both groups. There were no significant differences in cardiac, renal, or respiratory complications between the groups. The 30-day mortality was 10.8% (n=4) in group 1 and 0% in group 2 (P=.046).\nOur series has demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality (10.8% absolute risk reduction) and no increase in morbidity with the use of a TABFBG for fenestrated grafts. This is likely a result of the reduction in ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury in these patients. We therefore recommend the use of TABFBG in patients with proximal severe stenotic or occlusive disease and those in whom an operative time of >4 hours is predicted (typically those for whom three or more target fenestrations is planned).",

    "abstract": "Aortic aneurysm repair is a high-risk surgical procedure. Patients are often elderly, with multiple comorbidities that predispose them to perioperative morbidity. Use of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has increased due to reduced early perioperative risk. This study assessed whether preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) could be used to predict morbidity and hospital length of stay (LOS) after aortic aneurysm repair.\nA total of 185 patients underwent surgical repair (84 open repairs, 101 EVAR) and had adequate determination of a submaximal CPET parameter (anaerobic threshold).\nPatient comorbidities and cardiorespiratory fitness, derived from CPET, were similar between surgical procedures. Patients undergoing EVAR had fewer complications (10% vs 32%; P<.0001) and shorter mean (standard deviation [SD]) hospital LOS of 5.7 (9.3) days vs 14.4 (10.9) days compared with open repair (P<.0001). The hospital LOS was significantly increased in patients with one or more complications in both groups compared with those with no complications. In the open repair group, the level of fitness, as defined by anaerobic threshold, was an independent predictor of postoperative morbidity and hospital LOS. When the optimal anaerobic threshold (10 mL/min/kg) derived from receiver operator curve analysis was used as a cutoff value, unfit patients stayed significantly longer than fit patients in critical care (mean, 6.4 [SD, 6.9] days vs 2.4 [SD, 2.9] days; P=.002) and in the hospital (mean, 23.1 [SD, 14.8] days vs 11.0 [SD, 6.1] days; P<.0001). In contrast, fitness in the EVAR group was not predictive of postoperative morbidity but did have predictive value for hospital LOS.\nCardiorespiratory fitness holds significant clinical value before aortic aneurysm repair in predicting postsurgical complications and duration of critical care and hospital LOS. Preoperative measurement of fitness could then direct clinical management with regard to operative choice, postoperative resource allocation, and informed patient decision making.",

    "abstract": "The new integrated 0 + 5 vascular surgery (VS) training paradigm introduced in 2007 required program directors and faculty to reconsider recruiting methods and exposure of medical students to VS. As a means to identify variables important for recruitment of 0 + 5 VS applicants, we sought to analyze national 0 + 5 VS residency application trends and to compare medical school demographics of applicants to both our 0 + 5 residency and 5 + 2 fellowship programs.\nElectronic Residency Application Service and National Resident Matching Program online public databases were queried to evaluate nationwide trends in the number of applicants to integrated VS residency programs between 2007 and 2010. Demographic data from Electronic Residency Application Service applications submitted to our institution's 0 + 5 and 5 + 2 VS training programs during the same time period were reviewed.\nFrom 2008 to 2011, there were 190 applicants to our 0 + 5 VS residency program and 161 applicants to our 5 + 2 fellowship program, with 127 (66.8%) and 122 (75.8%) being United States medical graduates, respectively. Annual application volume to our programs over these years remained stable for both training pathways (range, 39-49 for 0 + 5 integrated; range, 39-43 for 5 + 2 traditional). Nationally, applications to 0 + 5 programs increased sixfold over the same time period (52 in 2007 to 340 applicants in 2010; P < .001), far exceeding the available training positions. Compared with applicants to the 5 + 2 VS fellowships, medical students applying to the 0 + 5 programs are more likely to be female, be slightly older, have additional postgraduate degrees and publications, have higher United States Medical Licensure Examination test scores, and are more likely to be in the top quartile of their medical school class.\nNationwide interest in the 0 + 5 vascular surgery residency training paradigm continues to significantly increase. Significant differences exist between the cohorts of 0 + 5 residency and 5 + 2 fellowship program applicants at the completion of medical school, suggesting that 0 + 5 VS residency programs are attracting a different medical student population to the VS specialty. VS program directors should continue to foster interest in this new applicant pool through early exposure, mentorship, and extracurricular research activities.",

    "abstract": "Delayed carotid endarterectomy (CEA) after a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) is associated with risks of recurrent neurologic symptoms. In an effort to preserve cerebral function, urgent early CEA has been recommended in many circumstances. We analyzed outcomes of different time intervals in early CEA in comparison with delayed treatment.\nRetrospective chart review from a single university hospital tertiary care center between April 1999 and November 2010 revealed 312 patients who underwent CEA following stroke or TIA. Of these 312 patients, 69 received their CEA within 30 days of symptom onset and 243 received their CEA after 30 days from symptom onset. The early CEA cohort was further stratified according to the timing of surgery: group A (27 patients), within 7 days; group B (17), between 8 and 14 days; group C (12), between 15 and 21 days; and group D (12), between 22 and 30 days. Demographic data as well as 30-day (mortality, stroke, TIA, and myocardial infarction) and long-term (all-cause mortality and stroke) adverse outcome rates were analyzed for each group. These were also analyzed for the entire early CEA cohort and compared against the delayed CEA group.\nDemographics and comorbid conditions were similar between groups. For 30-day outcomes, there were no deaths, 1 stroke (1.4%), 0 TIAs, and 0 myocardial infarctions in the early CEA cohort; in the delayed CEA cohort, there were 4 (1.6%), 4 (1.6%), 2 (0.8%), and 2 (0.8%) patients with these outcomes, respectively (P > .05 for all comparisons). Over the long term, the early group had one ipsilateral stroke at 17 months and the delayed group had two ipsilateral strokes at 3 and 12 months. For long-term outcomes, there were 16 deaths in the early CEA cohort (21%) and 74 deaths in the delayed CEA cohort (30%, P > .05). Mean follow-up times were 4.5 years in the early CEA cohort and 5.8 years in the delayed CEA cohort.\nThere were no differences in 30-day and long-term adverse outcome rates between the early and delayed CEA cohorts. In symptomatic carotid stenosis patients without evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage, carotid occlusion, or permanent neurologic deficits early carotid endarterectomy can be safely performed and is preferred over delaying operative treatment.",

    "abstract": "The selective cholesterol transport inhibitor ezetimibe is widely used to prevent development of atherosclerosis in patients with hypercholesterolemia. However, whether this agent inhibits intimal hyperplasia in autologous vein grafts is unknown. The present study was undertaken to clarify if ezetimibe reduces cell proliferation and intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts.\nForty-four rabbits were randomly divided into two groups: one group received ezetimibe (0.6 mg/kg/d), and the control group did not. Ezetimibe administration was started 1 week before rabbits underwent interposition reversed autologous jugular vein grafts. The proliferative cells and apoptotic cells were counted in the vein grafts 14 days after implantation, and changes in acetylcholine-induced relaxation and endothelial intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) were examined at 28 days.\nEzetimibe reduced serum cholesterol and triglyceride. There were fewer proliferating cells in the ezetimibe group (5.7%\u00b10.2%, n=7) than in the control group (12.8%\u00b10.5%, n=7; P<.0001) and more apoptotic cells in the ezetimibe group (5.3%\u00b10.2%, n=7) than in the control group (2.3%\u00b10.2%, n=7; P<.0001). Intimal hyperplasia was less in the ezetimibe group (46.1\u00b16.0 \u03bcm, n=7) than in the control group (76.0\u00b12.5 \u03bcm, n=7; P<.01). Acetylcholine-produced endothelium-dependent relaxation was observed only in the ezetimibe group, which was blocked by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor N\u03c9-nitro-l-arginine. Acetylcholine increased [Ca2+]i only in the ezetimibe group.\nEzetimibe reduced cell proliferation and enhanced cell apoptosis, thus inhibiting intimal hyperplasia in rabbit autologous vein grafts. Ezetimibe restored the acetylcholine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in endothelial cells and improved endothelium-dependent NO-mediated relaxation in the vein graft. Our results suggest that ezetimibe enhances the function of endothelial NO through an increase in endothelial [Ca2+]i, thus reducing vein graft intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased morbidity and death after open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (OAR). This study highlights the effect of CKD on outcomes after endovascular AAA (EVAR) and OAR in contemporary practice.\nThe National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) Participant Use File (2005-2008) was queried by Current Procedural Terminology (American Medical Association, Chicago, Ill) code to identify EVAR or OAR patients, who were grouped by CKD class as having mild (CKD class 1 or 2), moderate (CKD class 3), or severe (CKD class 4 or 5) renal disease. Propensity score analysis was performed to match OAR and EVAR patients with mild CKD with those with moderate or severe CKD. Comparative analysis of mortality and clinical outcomes was performed based on CKD strata.\nWe identified 8701 patients who were treated with EVAR (n = 5811) or OAR (n = 2890) of intact AAAs. Mild, moderate, and severe CKD was present in 63%, 30%, and 7%, respectively. CKD increased (P < .01) overall mortality, with rates of 1.7% (mild), 5.3% (moderate), and 7.7% (severe) in unmatched patients undergoing EVAR or OAR. Operative mortality rates in patients with severe CKD were as high as 6.2% for EVAR and 10.3% for OAR. Severity of CKD was associated with increasing frequency of risk factors; therefore, propensity matching to control for comorbidities was performed, resulting in similar baseline clinical and demographic features of patients with mild compared with those with moderate or severe disease. In propensity-matched cohorts, moderate CKD increased the risk of 30-day mortality for EVAR (1.9% mild vs 3.2% moderate; P = .013) and OAR (3.1% mild vs 8.4% moderate; P < .0001). Moderate CKD was also associated with increased morbidity in patients treated with EVAR (8.3% mild vs 12.8% moderate; P < .0001) or OAR (25.2% mild vs 32.4% moderate; P = .001). Similarly, severe CKD increased the risk of 30-day mortality for EVAR (2.6% mild vs 5.7% severe; P = .0081) and OAR (4.1% mild vs 9.9% severe; P = .0057). Severe CKD was also associated with increased morbidity in patients treated with EVAR (10.6% mild vs 19.2% severe; P < .0001) or OAR (31.1% mild vs 39.6% severe; P = .04).\nThe presence of moderate or severe CKD in patients considered for AAA repair is associated with significantly increased mortality and therefore should figure prominently in clinical decision making. The high mortality of AAA repair in patients with severe CKD is such that elective repair in such patients is not advised, except in extenuating clinical circumstances.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the natural history of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) is essential to patient care and surgical decision making. In this evidence summary we discuss some of the most clinically relevant features of the disease. The true incidence of TAAs is likely to be higher than currently reported because of the inherently silent nature of TAAs. However, TAAs can become rapidly lethal once dissection or rupture occurs, highlighting the need for more robust screening. The impressive discovery of familial patterns and novel genetic loci for TAAs challenges the idea that most TAAs are simply sporadic. Although the aorta grows in an indolent manner, its rate of growth and its current diameter both have important clinical implications. Biomechanical studies have supported clinical findings of 6.0 cm as a dangerous threshold. Surgical extirpation of TAAs is currently the mainstay of effective treatment. Although endovascular TAA repair is becoming increasingly common, long-term safety remains unproven. We still need more data to support the concept that any medical therapy is effective.",

Medical therapy and risk factor modification is part of any treatment regimen; with this there is little disagreement. However, with the introduction of lesser invasive percutaneous technologies, the discussion regarding surgical and endovascular therapies has become more and more complicated. Unfortunately, there is a relative shortage of robust outcomes data to support many of our specific treatment recommendations. Younger patients are an especially troublesome patient cohort. They have consistently shown poorer outcomes after any intervention compared with older patients and may represent a subset of more aggressive atherosclerotic disease.

    "abstract": "The past decade has seen the beginning of a revolution in the way in which surgeons learn their craft. As technology has become increasingly sophisticated, and care more accountable, traditional methods of skill acquisition are no longer optimal as sole training modalities. Against this backdrop, there has been a shift toward competency-based training programs reflecting the growing emphasis on outcomes-based medical education. The modern vascular specialist needs to possess a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of vascular disease, imaging modalities, and the nonoperative and operative management of the vascular patient. Surgical educators are therefore compelled to develop practical training programs that can teach each of these skills in a safe, learner-centric manner. This report highlights how an understanding of pedagogy or the principles of adult learning can aid this endeavor. Key models of educational theory are presented and their application to vascular training and the development of expertise are highlighted. The report concludes with recommendations for surgical educators to build assessments of competence using these theoretic principles to optimize the training of the next generation of vascular surgeons.",

This review presents the existing evidence relating to QOL changes in patients undergoing AAA repair by open repair (OR) and endovascular techniques (EVAR) and challenges current misconceptions about the relative effect of these two procedures.\nA comprehensive literature search was performed to identify studies relating to QOL or health status in AAA repair. Quality of included studies was assessed according to Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodology.\nTwenty-three studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Preoperative QOL in AAA patients has been previously suggested as being worse than that of the general population, that OR patients have a worse QOL in the early postoperative period, and that EVAR patients have a worse QOL in the longer term. None of these assertions is uniformly supported in the literature. From the existing evidence, no clear conclusions can be drawn about the relative QOL benefits of OR vs EVAR.\nThere are a paucity of good-quality data relating to health status and QOL in patients undergoing AAA repair. Little is known about the prevalence of preoperative or postoperative symptoms and the degree to which these influence patient well-being. Further investigation is needed to clarify health status and QOL changes in these patients and allow clinicians to make targeted improvements in practice.",

    "abstract": "While endovascular (ENDO) therapy has increasingly become the initial intervention of choice to treat lower extremity peripheral arterial disease, reported outcomes for ENDO in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and diabetes have been reported to be inferior compared to open bypass surgery (OPEN). Objective data assessing the hemodynamic success of ENDO compared to the established benchmark of OPEN are sparse. We therefore evaluated and compared early hemodynamic outcomes of ENDO and OPEN in patients with diabetes with CLI at a single academic center.\nWe studied 85 consecutive patients with diabetes and CLI who underwent 109 interventions, either ENDO (n = 78) or OPEN (n = 31). The mean patient age was 69 years; 62% were men. All patients presented with either rest pain and/or ulcer/gangrene. Per protocol, all were assessed using ankle brachial index (ABI) and toe pressure (TP) determinations before and early postintervention.\nBoth ENDO (\u0394ABI = 0.36 \u00b1 0.24, P < .0001; \u0394TP = 35.6 \u00b1 24.1, P < .0001) and OPEN (\u0394ABI = 0.39 \u00b1 0.17, P < .0001; \u0394TP = 34.3 \u00b1 24.0, P < .0001) resulted in significant hemodynamic improvement. There was no statistically significant initial difference between the two types of intervention (ABI, P = .6; TP, P = .6).\nThese data suggest that with appropriate patient selection, each intervention is similarly efficacious in initially improving hemodynamics. If the intermediate or long-term results of ENDO for CLI in people with diabetes are inferior, the problem is not one of initial hemodynamic response, but more likely due to differing patient characteristics or durability of the intervention.",

    "abstract": "The escalating cost burden of hospital readmission has prompted recent nationwide efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of this important quality measure. Because patients undergoing vascular surgery account for a significant proportion of readmissions, vascular surgeons may face reduced reimbursements in the near future if these trends continue. However, risk factors associated with readmission remain poorly defined, and further research is needed to identify interventions that will prevent readmission following vascular procedures. Accordingly, this manuscript will (1) propose a conceptual model to explain the driving forces behind readmissions in vascular surgery, (2) review current evidence directed at identifying risk factors and evaluating interventions to reduce readmissions across different medical and surgical specialties, and (3) identify key areas in patient care where targeted research or interventions may be implemented in vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of the mode of anesthesia and outcome after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nReview methods were according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Published and unpublished literature was searched. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were categorized for patient selection, perioperative outcomes, and postoperative outcomes. Weighted mean differences (WMD) were calculated for continuous variables, such as length of stay, and pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for discrete variables such as major morbidity.\nTen studies of 13,459 patients given local anesthesia (LA) or general anesthesia (GA) were eligible for analysis. There was no difference in 30-day mortality. The LA patients were older than the GA patients (WMD, 0.17; P = .006), with an increased burden of cardiac (LA vs GA: OR, 1.28; P = .011) and respiratory (LA vs GA: OR, 1.28; P = .006) comorbidity. LA EVAR was reported with shorter operative time (WMD, -0.54; P = .001) and hospital stay (WMD, -0.27; P = .001) vs GA. LA patients developed fewer postoperative complications than GA patients (OR, 0.54; P < .001).\nThe absence of randomized data is a major hurdle to understanding the effect of anesthetic technique on morbidity after EVAR. The data presented are encouraging in selected patients. The use of locoregional anesthesia for EVAR should be further investigated with better reporting of aneurysm morphology to clarify its potential benefits and identify the subgroups that will derive greatest benefit.",

Two 20-mm Excluder contralateral limbs were then positioned upside-down in the 23-mm cuff and deployed simultaneously, creating a new bifurcated prosthesis. Control computed tomography (CT) scan at 6 weeks showed a good position of the endografts without signs of an endoleak. In conclusion, a type IIIb endoleak at the level of the flow divider may successfully be excluded using two telescoping cuffs and two parallel upside-down contralateral Excluder limbs. Due to the rarity of this complication, the treatment will always have to be tailor-made.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine if there are sex-based differences in the inflammatory phenotype of patients undergoing lower extremity bypass (LEB) and if they correlate with clinical outcomes.\nThis was a retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort of 225 patients (161 men and 64 women) who underwent autogenous vein LEB between February 2004 and May 2008. Fasting baseline blood samples were obtained before LEB, and the inflammatory biomarkers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen were assessed. All patients underwent ultrasound graft surveillance. CRP levels were dichotomized at 5 mg/L and fibrinogen levels at 600 mg/dL.\nThere were no significant differences in age, race, history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus, body mass index, or coronary artery disease between men and women. Men were more likely to be current smokers (P = .02), have a history of hypercholesterolemia (P = .02), and be taking statins (P = .02). Women were more likely to present with critical limb ischemia (P = .03) and had higher median baseline CRP levels (5.15 mg/L; interquartile range [IQR], 1.51-18.62 mg/L) than men (2.70; IQR, 1.24-6.98 mg/L; P = .02). Median follow-up was 893 days (IQR, 539-1315 days). A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model for primary vein graft patency showed a significant interaction between sex and CRP (P = .03) and fibrinogen (P = .02). After adjustment for key covariates, primary vein graft patency was significantly less in women with CRP >5 mg/L compared with women with CRP <5 mg/L (P = .02). No such difference was seen in men (P = .95). Primary graft patency was also decreased in women with fibrinogen >600 mg/dL vs women with fibrinogen <600 mg/dL (P = .002); again, this pattern was not evident in men (P = .19).\nWomen undergoing LEB for advanced peripheral artery disease have a different inflammatory phenotype than men. Elevated baseline levels of CRP and fibrinogen are associated with inferior vein graft patency in women but not in men. These findings indicate an important interaction between sex and inflammation in the healing response of vein grafts for LEB. Women with elevated preoperative CRP and fibrinogen levels may benefit from more intensive postoperative graft surveillance protocols.",

    "abstract": "For peripheral arterial disease, infrainguinal bypass grafting (BPG) carries a higher perioperative risk compared with peripheral endovascular procedures. The choice between the open and endovascular therapies is to an extent dependent on the expected periprocedural risk associated with each. Tools for estimating the periprocedural risk in patients undergoing BPG have not been reported in the literature. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a calculator to estimate the risk of perioperative mortality \u226430 days of elective BPG.\nWe identified 9556 patients (63.9% men) who underwent elective BPG from the 2007 to 2009 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data sets. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with 30-day perioperative mortality. Bootstrapping was used for internal validation. The risk factors were subsequently used to develop a risk calculator.\nPatients had a median age of 68 years. The 30-day mortality rate was 1.8% (n = 170). Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified seven preoperative predictors of 30-day mortality: increasing age, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, chronic corticosteroid use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dependent functional status, dialysis dependence, and lower extremity rest pain. Bootstrapping was used for internal validation. The model demonstrated excellent discrimination (C statistic, 0.81; bias-corrected C statistic, 0.81) and calibration. The validated risk model was used to develop an interactive risk calculator using the logistic regression equation.\nThe validated risk calculator has excellent predictive ability for 30-day mortality in a patient after an elective BPG. It is anticipated to aid in surgical decision making, informed patient consent, preoperative optimization, and consequently, risk reduction.",

    "abstract": "Although large randomized studies have established the efficacy and safety of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and, recently, carotid artery stenting (CAS), the under-representation of women in these trials leaves the comparison of risks to benefits of performing these procedures on women an open question. To address this issue, we reviewed the hospital outcomes and delineated patient characteristics predicting outcome in women undergoing carotid interventions using New York and Florida statewide hospital discharge databases.\nWe analyzed in-hospital mortality, postoperative stroke, cardiac postoperative complications, and combined postoperative stoke and mortality in 20,613 CEA or CAS hospitalizations for the years 2007 to 2009. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses of variables were performed.\nCEA was performed in 16,576 asymptomatic and 1744 symptomatic women and CAS in 1943 asymptomatic and 350 symptomatic women. Compared with CAS, CEA rates, in asymptomatic vs symptomatic, were significantly lower for in-hospital mortality (0.3% vs 0.8% and 0.4% vs 3.4%), stroke (1.5% vs 2.6% and 3.5% vs 9.4%), and combined stroke/mortality (1.7% vs 3.1% and 3.8% vs 10.9%). In cohorts matched by propensity scores, the same trend favoring CEA remained significant in symptomatic women. There was no difference in cardiac complication rates among asymptomatic women, but among symptomatic woman cardiac complications were more frequent after CAS (10.6% vs 6.5%; P = .0077). Among symptomatic women, the presence of renal disease, coronary artery disease, or age \u226580 years increased the risk of CAS over CEA threefold for the composite end point of stroke or death. For asymptomatic women only in those with coronary artery disease or diabetes, there was a statistical difference in the composite mortality/stroke rates favoring CEA (1.9% vs 3.3% and 1.7% vs 3.4%, respectively). After adjusting for relevant clinical and demographic risk factors and hospital annual volume, for CAS vs CEA, the risk of the composite end point of stroke or mortality was 1.7-fold higher in symptomatic and 3.4-fold higher in asymptomatic patients. Medicaid insurance, symptomatic patient, history of cancer, and presence of heart failure on admission were among other strong predictors of composite stroke/mortality outcome.\nDatabases reflecting real-world practice performance and management of carotid disease in women suggest that CEA compared with CAS has overall better perioperative outcomes in women. Importantly, CAS is associated with significantly higher morbidity in certain clinical settings and this should be taken into account when choosing a revascularization procedure.",

Compared with CAS, CEA rates, in asymptomatic vs symptomatic, were significantly lower for in-hospital mortality (0.3% vs 0.8% and 0.4% vs 3.4%), stroke (1.5% vs 2.6% and 3.5% vs 9.4%), and combined stroke/mortality (1.7% vs 3.1% and 3.8% vs 10.9%). In cohorts matched by propensity scores, the same trend favoring CEA remained significant in symptomatic women. There was no difference in cardiac complication rates among asymptomatic women, but among symptomatic woman cardiac complications were more frequent after CAS (10.6% vs 6.5%; P = .0077). Among symptomatic women, the presence of renal disease, coronary artery disease, or age \u226580 years increased the risk of CAS over CEA threefold for the composite end point of stroke or death. For asymptomatic women only in those with coronary artery disease or diabetes, there was a statistical difference in the composite mortality/stroke rates favoring CEA (1.9% vs 3.3% and 1.7% vs 3.4%, respectively). After adjusting for relevant clinical and demographic risk factors and hospital annual volume, for CAS vs CEA, the risk of the composite end point of stroke or mortality was 1.7-fold higher in symptomatic and 3.4-fold higher in asymptomatic patients. Medicaid insurance, symptomatic patient, history of cancer, and presence of heart failure on admission were among other strong predictors of composite stroke/mortality outcome.",

    "abstract": "The role of gender on the outcome of infrainguinal arterial revascularization (IAR) for peripheral arterial occlusive disease remains uncertain. This study analyzed the outcome of IARs performed over 15 years, stratifying the results by sex.\nDetails of consecutive patients undergoing primary IAR for peripheral arterial occlusive disease from 1995 to 2009 at our institution were prospectively stored in a vascular registry. Demographics, risk factors, indications for surgery, inflow sources, outflow target vessels, types of conduit, and adverse outcomes were analyzed. Postoperative surveillance included clinical examination supplemented with duplex scans and ankle-brachial index measurements in all patients at discharge, 30 days, 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter. End points of the study, ie, patency, limb salvage, and survival rates, were assessed using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis. The \u03c7(2) or Fisher exact, Student t, and log-rank tests were used to establish statistical significance.\nOur sample consisted of 1459 IARs performed in 1333 patients, comprising 496 women (37.2%; 531 IARs), who were a mean 3 years older than the men (74 vs 71 years; P < .001) and had a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus (52% vs 46%; P = .03) and surgery for limb salvage (91% vs 87%; P = .02). An autogenous vein conduit (great or small saphenous, or both, spliced, arm, or composite veins) was used in 87% of the IARs. No deaths occurred perioperatively (30 days). The major and minor complication rates were comparable between men and women. At 10 years, the primary patency rate was 47% in women vs 49% in men (P = .67), the assisted primary patency rate was, respectively, 53% vs 50% (P = .69), the secondary patency rate was 61% vs 61% (P = .66), limb salvage rate was 93% vs 91% (P = .54), and survival rate was 43% vs 49% (P = .65). Stratifying by type of conduit revealed no differences in patency or limb salvage rates.\nDespite an older age and more advanced stages of disease on presentation in women, IAR performed in women can achieve patency and limb salvage rates statistically no different from those recorded in their male counterparts, supporting the conviction that sex per se does not influence the outcome of lower extremity revascularization.",

    "abstract": "When all access options in the upper limbs have been exhausted, an autogenous access in lower limb is a valuable alternative to arteriovenous grafts. We report our experience of transposition of the femoral vein (tFV).\nFrom June 1984 to June 2011, 70 patients underwent 72 tFV in two centers (Paris and Mekn\u00e8s) with the same technique. All patients had exhausted upper arm veins or had central vein obstructions. Patients were followed by serial duplex scanning. All complications were recorded and statistical analysis of patency was performed according to intention to treat using the life-table method.\nThe mean interval between initiation of dialysis and creation of the tFV was 10 years. The sex ratio was even (one female/one male). Mean age was 48 years (range, 1-84 years), and there were no postoperative infections. Duplex measurements in 33 patients indicated high-flow: mean = 1529 \u00b1 429 mL/min; range, 700-3000 mL/min. Two immediate failures were observed and four patients were lost to follow-up soon after the access creation. Ten patients (14%) experienced minor complications (hematoma, five; lymphocele, one; delayed wound healing, two; distal edema, two) and 30 patients (42%) experienced mild complications (femoral vein and outflow stenosis, 16 [treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, 13, or polytetrafluoroethylene patch, three]; puncture site complications, three [ischemia, two; infection, one]; reversible thrombosis, three [two surgical and one percutaneous thrombectomy]; abandoned thrombosis, eight [11%] after a mean patency of 8.1 years). Thirteen patients (18%) experienced major complications necessitating fistula ligation (ischemic complications, five diabetic patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease [one major amputation included]; lower leg compartment syndrome, one; acute venous hypertension, two; secondary major edema, two; high-output cardiac failure, one; bleeding, two). All the patent accesses (59/72) were utilized for dialysis after a mean interval of 2 \u00b1 1 months (range, 1-7 months) resulting in an 82% success rate. According to life-table analysis, the primary patency rates at 1 and 9 years were 91% \u00b1 4% and 45% \u00b1 11%, respectively. The secondary patency rates at 1 and 9 years were 84% \u00b1 5% and 56% \u00b1 9%, respectively.\nFemoral vein transposition in the lower limb is a valuable alternative to arteriovenous grafts in terms of infection and long-term patency. Secondary venous percutaneous angioplasties may be necessary. High flow rates are frequently observed and patient selection is essential to avoid ischemic complications.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) that also involve the common iliac artery (CIA) typically is accomplished by endograft limb extension into the external iliac artery (EIA). In order to prevent endoleak, the internal iliac artery (IIA) is usually embolized, or alternatively a branched limb is deployed. However, IIA embolization is associated with longer operative time and increased use of contrast and radiation. It has been our practice not to routinely coil embolize the IIA. The purpose of this study was to present the midterm outcomes of this approach.\nBetween April 1997 and June 2010, 137 patients (130 men; mean age, 70.9 years; range, 45-92 years) underwent EVAR of their AAA and had IIA coverage without coil embolization in 112 patients (no embolization [NE] group) and after coil embolization in 25 patients (coil embolization [CE] group). Anatomic indications for coverage of the IIA without coil embolization included presence of adequate sealing in the distal 5 mm of the CIA, or sealing ring at the origin of the CIA, or IIA diameter <5 mm. Preoperative mean AAA size was 60 \u00b1 14 mm, and mean CIA diameter was 38 \u00b1 13 mm. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) scanning was performed at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter.\nThirty-day mortality was 0.7% (1 of 137 patients). A patient presented with gluteal skin necrosis (0.7%). The incidence of postoperative buttock claudication was not different between the two groups (NE: 15 of 112 patients; CE: 3 of 25 patients; P = .852). Procedure and fluoroscopy time, contrast use, and hospital stay were significantly reduced in the NE group. Patients were followed up for 33 \u00b1 30 months. During follow-up, 44 patients died (32.1%) and in 3 of them (2.2%), death was AAA-related. There was no difference in cumulative survival between the two groups at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. Secondary interventions were performed in 20 of 137 patients (14.5%), including three conversions for proximal endoleak. There was no difference between the two groups in the incidence of secondary interventions (NE: 18 of 112 patients; CE: two of 25 patients; P = .301) and freedom from reintervention at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. Ten patients (8.9%) from the NE group presented a type II endoleak during follow-up. Seven of them were associated with the covered IIA; none required reintervention.\nStent graft coverage of the IIA without coil embolization is a safe, simple, and effective maneuver for the treatment of aortoiliac aneurysms, with a low incidence of postoperative complications and reinterventions and acceptable immediate and midterm results.",

    "abstract": "A discrepancy between characteristics of patients treated with carotid angioplasty and stent placement (CAS) within and outside clinical trials, particularly characteristics with direct impact on clinical outcome, may limit generalization of clinical trial results. The objective of this study was to identify differences in demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes related to CAS in patients treated within clinical trials and those treated outside clinical trials in a large national cohort.\nWe determined the frequency of CAS performed within and outside clinical trials and associated in-hospital outcomes using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Survey data files from 2005 to 2009. All the in-hospital outcomes were analyzed after adjusting for potential confounders using multivariate analysis.\nOf the 81,638 patients who underwent CAS, 16,078 (19.6%) underwent the procedure as part of a clinical trial. The mean age of the patients was significantly lower in patients treated with CAS as part of a clinical trial than those treated with CAS outside a clinical trial. The proportion of women and nonwhites was lower among patients treated with CAS as part of a clinical trial. The in-hospital mortality was two-fold higher among patients treated with CAS outside clinical trials (1.12% vs 0.53%; P = .0005). The rate of composite endpoint of stroke, cardiac events, and death was significantly higher among patients treated with CAS outside clinical trials (P = .02). After adjusting for age, gender, presence of renal failure, and hospital bed size, CAS performed as part of a clinical trial was associated with lower rates of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.467; 95% confidence interval, 0.290-0.751; P = .0017) and composite endpoint of stroke, cardiac events, and death (odds ratio, 0.752; 95% confidence interval, 0.594-0.952; P = .0180).\nOur results suggest that CAS procedures performed as part of clinical trials was associated with lower rates of in-hospital mortality and composite endpoint of stroke, cardiac events, and death in United States. These findings highlight the need for strategies that ensure appropriate adoption of CAS to ensure that the benefits observed in clinical trials can be replicated in general practice.",

The proportion of women and nonwhites was lower among patients treated with CAS as part of a clinical trial. The in-hospital mortality was two-fold higher among patients treated with CAS outside clinical trials (1.12% vs 0.53%; P = .0005). The rate of composite endpoint of stroke, cardiac events, and death was significantly higher among patients treated with CAS outside clinical trials (P = .02). After adjusting for age, gender, presence of renal failure, and hospital bed size, CAS performed as part of a clinical trial was associated with lower rates of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.467; 95% confidence interval, 0.290-0.751; P = .0017) and composite endpoint of stroke, cardiac events, and death (odds ratio, 0.752; 95% confidence interval, 0.594-0.952; P = .0180).",

Long-segment thoracoabdominal aortic occlusion, an extreme manifestation of this disorder, has not previously been reported in children. Two pediatric patients with this entity, a 5- and 13-year-old with uncontrolled hypertension, underwent extensive arterial reconstructions for this entity and provided the impetus for this report. An ascending thoracic aorta to infrarenal aortic expanded polytetrafluoroethylene bypass was undertaken in the younger child. A distal thoracic aorto-bi-iliac artery expanded polytetrafluoroethylene bypass, with implantation of the left renal artery to one graft limb and a right renal artery bypass originating from the other limb, was performed in the older child. There were no major perioperative complications. Both patients were discharged with easily controlled blood pressures. They have remained normotensive at 13 and 14 months follow-up.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this report was to present abnormal posttraumatic cold intolerance in patients that previously underwent repair of arterial injuries after civilian upper limb trauma in our institution.\nAll patients who underwent repair of arterial lesions after upper limb trauma since 1990 were reviewed, and clinical follow-up studies were performed. Patients were asked to complete the cold intolerance symptom severity (CISS) questionnaire to evaluate presence and severity of self-reported cold sensitivity, and the disabilities of arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) questionnaire to analyze functional disability. Abnormal cold intolerance was defined as a CISS score over 30. Further analysis included evaluation of epidemiologic, clinical, and perioperative data for factors predisposing to abnormal cold intolerance.\nA total of 87 patients with previous repair of upper limb arterial injuries were eligible to answer the CISS and DASH questionnaires, and 56 patients (64%; 43 men; median age: 31.9 years) completed both. In our cohort, blunt trauma was the predominant cause of injury (n = 50; 89%). Accompanying lesions of nerves (n = 22; 39%) and/or orthopedic injuries (n = 36; 64%) were present in 48 patients (86%). After a median follow-up period of 5.5 years (range, 0.5-19.7), 23 patients (41% of 56) reported on abnormal cold intolerance. Patients with cold intolerance had worse functional results (as measured by the DASH questionnaire; mean \u00b1 SD, 42.7 \u00b1 29.7 vs 11.5 \u00b1 23.9; P < .001) when compared with patients without. Cold intolerance was more frequently seen in patients with previous nerve lesion (P = .027) and in proximal injuries (subclavian or axillary vs brachial or forearm arteries: P = .006), but was not correlated to gender, age, involvement of the dominant or nondominant arm, and the presence of ischemia, bone injury, or an isolated vascular injury.\nAbnormal cold intolerance is frequently seen in patients with a history of arterial repair in upper limb trauma. It is associated with significant functional impairment. Concomitant nerve injury and involvement of the subclavian or axillary artery are the major predisposing factors for development of cold intolerance after upper limb trauma.",

    "abstract": "The calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) model is a widely accepted rodent model for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Calcium deposition, mainly consisting of calcium phosphate (CaPO(4)) crystals, has been reported to exist in human and experimental aneurysms. CaPO(4) crystals have been used for in vitro DNA transfection by mixing CaCl(2) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Here, we describe accelerated aneurysm formation resulting from a modification of the CaCl(2) model.\nA modified CaCl(2) model, the CaPO(4) model, was created by applying PBS onto the mouse infrarenal aorta after CaCl(2) treatment. Morphologic, histologic, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on arteries treated with the CaPO(4) model and the conventional CaCl(2) model as the control. In vitro methods were performed using a mixture of CaCl(2) and PBS to create CaPO(4) crystals. CaPO(4)- induced apoptosis of primary cultured mouse vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) was measured by DNA fragmentation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nThe CaPO(4) model produces AAA, defined as an increase of \u226550% in the diameter of the aorta, faster than in the CaCl(2) model. The CaPO(4) model showed significantly larger aneurysmal dilation at 7, 28, and 42 days, as reflected by a maximum diameter (measured in mm) fold-change of 1.69 \u00b1 0.07, 1.99 \u00b1 0.14, and 2.13 \u00b1 0.09 vs 1.22 \u00b1 0.04, 1.48 \u00b1 0.07, and 1.68 \u00b1 0.06 in a CaCl(2) model, respectively (n = 6; P < .05). A semiquantitative grading analysis of elastin fiber integrity at 7 days revealed a significant increase in elastin degradation in the CaPO(4) model compared with the CaCl(2) model (2.7 \u00b1 0.2 vs 1.5 \u00b1 0.2; n = 6; P < .05). A significantly higher level of apoptosis occurred in the CaPO(4) model (apoptosis index at 1, 2, and 3 days postsurgery: 0.26 \u00b1 0.14, 0.37 \u00b1 0.14, and 0.33 \u00b1 0.08 vs 0.012 \u00b1 0.10, 0.15 \u00b1 0.02, and 0.12 \u00b1 0.05 in the conventional CaCl(2) model; n = 3; P < .05). An enhancement of macrophage infiltration and calcification was also observed at 3 and 7 days in the CaPO(4) model. CaPO(4) induced approximately 3.7 times more apoptosis in VSMCs than a mixture of CaCl(2) (n = 4; P < .0001) in vitro.\nThe CaPO(4) model accelerates aneurysm formation with the enhancement of apoptosis, macrophage infiltration, and calcium deposition. This modified model, with its rapid and robust dilation, can be used as a new model for AAAs.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of endovascular interventions has been reported to lower amputation rates, but patients who undergo endovascular and open revascularization are not directly comparable. We have adopted an endovascular-first approach but individualize the revascularization technique according to patient characteristics. This study compared characteristics of patients who had endovascular and open procedures and assessed the long-term outcomes.\nFrom December 2002 to September 2010, 433 patients underwent infrainguinal revascularization for critical limb ischemia (CLI; Rutherford IV-VI) of 514 limbs (endovascular: 295 patients, 363 limbs; open: 138 patients, 151 limbs). Patency rates, limb salvage (LS), and survival, as also their predictors, were calculated using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analysis.\nThe endovascular group was older, with more diabetes, renal insufficiency, and tissue loss. More reconstructions were multilevel (72% vs 39%; P < .001) and the most distal level of intervention was infrapopliteal in the open group (64% vs 49%; P = .001). The 30-day mortality was 2.8% in the endovascular and 6.0% in the open group (P = .079). Mean follow-up was 28.4 \u00b1 23.1 months (0-100). In the endovascular vs open groups, 7% needed open, and 24% needed inflow/runoff endovascular reinterventions with or without thrombolysis vs 6% and 17%. In the endovascular vs open group, 5-year LS was 78% \u00b1 3% vs 78% \u00b1 4% (P = .992), amputation-free survival was 30% \u00b1 3% vs 39% \u00b1 5% (P = .227), and survival was 36% \u00b1 4% vs 46% \u00b1 5% (P = .146). Five-year primary patency (PP), assisted-primary patency (APP), and secondary patency (SP) rates were 50 \u00b1 5%, 70 \u00b1 5% and 73 \u00b1 6% in endovascular, and 48 \u00b1 6%, 59 \u00b1 6% and 64 \u00b1 6% in the open group, respectively (P = .800 for PP, 0.037 for APP, 0.022 for SP). Multivariate analysis identified poor functional capacity (hazard ratio, 3.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.9-6.5]; P < .001), dialysis dependence (2.2 [1.3-3.8]; P = .003), gangrene (2.2 [1.4-3.4]; P < .001), need for infrapopliteal intervention (2.0 [1.2-3.1]; P = .004), and diabetes (1.8 [1.1-3.1]; P = .031) as predictors of limb loss. Poor functional capacity (3.3 [2.4-4.6]; P < .001), coronary artery disease (1.5 [1.1-2.1]; P = .006), and gangrene (1.4 [1.1-1.9]; P = .007) predicted poorer survival. Statin use predicted improved survival (0.6 [0.5-0.8]; P = .001). Need for infrapopliteal interventions predicted poorer PP (0.6 [0.5-0.9-2.2]; P = .007), whereas use of autologous vein predicted better PP (1.8 [1.1-2.9]; P = .017).\nPatients who undergo endovascular revascularization for CLI are medically higher-risk patients. Those who have bypass have more complex disease and are more likely to require multilevel reconstruction and infrapopliteal intervention. Individualizing revascularization results in optimization of early and late outcomes with acceptable LS, although survival remains low in those with poor health status.",

Multivariate analysis identified poor functional capacity (hazard ratio, 3.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.9-6.5]; P < .001), dialysis dependence (2.2 [1.3-3.8]; P = .003), gangrene (2.2 [1.4-3.4]; P < .001), need for infrapopliteal intervention (2.0 [1.2-3.1]; P = .004), and diabetes (1.8 [1.1-3.1]; P = .031) as predictors of limb loss. Poor functional capacity (3.3 [2.4-4.6]; P < .001), coronary artery disease (1.5 [1.1-2.1]; P = .006), and gangrene (1.4 [1.1-1.9]; P = .007) predicted poorer survival. Statin use predicted improved survival (0.6 [0.5-0.8]; P = .001). Need for infrapopliteal interventions predicted poorer PP (0.6 [0.5-0.9-2.2]; P = .007), whereas use of autologous vein predicted better PP (1.8 [1.1-2.9]; P = .017).",

    "abstract": "Sclerosing mediastinitis is a rare, progressive condition characterized by extensive fibrotic reaction. We report the first known case of symptomatic, extrinsic compression of the carotid artery by fibrotic extension of sclerosing mediastinitis. A 54-year-old woman began experiencing neurologic symptoms from extension of a known mediastinal mass resulting in 70% to 79% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. The stenosis was treated with endovascular stenting. Completion angiogram revealed a good result with <10% residual stenosis. At 18-month follow-up, the patient was symptom free without evidence of re-stenosis. Endovascular therapy provides a novel and durable solution in the midterm to this very rare problem.",

    "abstract": "Strict glucose control in patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting has been shown to decrease infectious complications, arrhythmias, and mortality. Our objective was to determine if strict glucose control reduced morbidity after lower extremity bypass (LEB).\nA prospective pilot study at a single institution within the Vascular Study Group of New England was conducted from January 2009 to December 2010. Patients with diabetes and without undergoing LEB were placed on an intravenous (IV) insulin infusion for 3 days after surgery with titration of blood glucose from 80 to 150 mg/dL. The IV insulin study group (n = 104) was compared to a historic control group (n = 189) that received standard insulin treatment from the preceding 3 years. The Fisher exact test, t-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, \u03c7(2), and logistic regression analyses were used to compare in-hospital morbidity. Stratified analyses were conducted to determine if findings differed based on the presence or absence of diabetes.\nThere was no difference in postoperative complications between the two groups with regard to graft infection, myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, primary patency at discharge, or mortality. Patients in the IV insulin group had significantly fewer in-hospital wound infections (4% vs 11%; odds ratio [OR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.96; P = .047). This association strengthened after adjusting for potentially confounding baseline differences in gender, body mass index, and smoking status (adjusted OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05-0.84; P = .03). When stratified by presence of diabetes, wound infections were decreased in the IV insulin group (0/44 [0%] vs 9/90 [10%]; P = .03). In patients without diabetes treated with IV insulin, there was no significant difference in wound infections (7% vs 12%; P = .42).\nStrict glucose control with a postoperative insulin infusion protocol significantly decreased the incidence of postoperative in-hospital wound infection in the diabetic population. These previously unreported findings from this single-institution prospective study warrant further investigation.",

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of preprocedural clopidogrel on target vessel revascularization (TVR), reintervention, and restenosis for patients who underwent recurrent renal artery angioplasty.\nA retrospective analysis of patients treated for RAR in a single tertiary center from January 1999 to December 2009 was conducted. Patients were divided into preadmission use of (1) clopidogrel or (2) aspirin only (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) for the initial procedure. TVR was defined as occurrence of a tertiary procedure for symptomatic RAR. Rate of freedom from event (ie, tertiary restenosis and TVR) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method.\nEighty-eight interventions were performed on 77 patients with RAR; 66% were females with average (mean \u00b1 SEM) age and body mass index of 68.8 \u00b1 1.1 and 28.6 \u00b1 0.8, respectively. Comorbidities included 96% chronic hypertension, 33% diabetes, 76% hyperlipidemia, 20% renal insufficiency, 39% tobacco use, 58% coronary artery disease, and 51% peripheral vascular disease. Clopidogrel use increased significantly during the index procedure from admission 35.2% to discharge 97.7% (P < .001, McNemar test). There was a trend toward risk reduction of a tertiary intervention (23%) for patients admitted on clopidogrel compared with ASA (P = .052). Likewise, there was a trend (P = .051) toward increased freedom from a tertiary intervention, with cumulative freedom at 8 years 93.5% for clopidogrel vs 61% for ASA. No differences were found for restenosis.\nThe use of preprocedural clopidogrel was associated with a possible risk reduction of TVR reintervention, but this finding needs to be validated in randomized clinical trial.",

    "abstract": "The National Kidney Foundation recommends that arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) be placed in at least 65% of hemodialysis patients. Some studies suggest that African American patients are less likely to receive a first-time AVF than patients of other ethnicities, although the reason for this disparity is unclear. The purpose of our study is to determine (1) whether there are ethnic differences in AVF creation, (2) whether this may be related to differences in vein diameters, and (3) whether AVF patency rates are similar between African American and non-African American male patients.\nConsecutive male patients undergoing first-time hemodialysis access from 2006 to 2010 at two institutions were retrospectively reviewed. Data collected included age, ethnicity, weight, height, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, smoking history, intravenous drug abuse, need for temporary access placement, and preoperative venous ultrasound measurements. Categoric variables were compared using \u03c7(2) analysis, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare continuous variables.\nOf 249 male patients identified, 95 were African American. Median age in African American and non-African American patients was 63 years. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia were statistically significantly greater in African American patients. The need for temporary access before hemoaccess was similar between the cohorts. African American patients demonstrated significantly smaller median basilic and cephalic vein diameters at most measured sites. Overall, 221 of 249 (88.8%) underwent AVF first. An AV graft was created in 17.9% of African American patients vs in only 7.1% of non-African Americans (odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.4; P = .009). The difference between median vein diameters used for autologous fistula creation in African American and non-African American patients was not significant. There was no significant difference in the primary patency (80.8% vs 76.2%; P = .4), primary functional patency (73.1% vs 69.2%; P = .5), or secondary functional patency rates (91.0% vs 96.5%; P = .1). Average primary fistula survival time was 257 days in African American and 256 in non-African American patients (P = .2).\nAfrican American patients are less likely than non-African American patients to undergo AVF during first-time hemodialysis access surgery. This ethnic discrepancy appears to be due to smaller arm vein diameters in African American patients. In African American patients with appropriate vein diameters who do undergo AVF, primary and functional patencies are equivalent to non-African American patients.",

    "abstract": "The two techniques for carotid endarterectomy (CEA)--conventional (C-CEA) and eversion (E-CEA)--have different effects on blood pressure. This study compared sympathetic activity after C-CEA and E-CEA, as measured by renin and catecholamine levels.\nE-CEA (n = 40) and C-CEA (n = 34) were performed in 74 patients with high-grade carotid stenosis. The choice of technique was made at the discretion of the operating surgeon. All patients received clonidine (150 \u03bcg) preoperatively. Regional anesthesia was used. The carotid sinus nerve was transected during E-CEA and preserved during C-CEA. Renin, metanephrine, and normetanephrine levels were measured preoperatively and at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively.\nCompared with baseline, levels of renin, metanephrine, and normetanephrine decreased at 24 and 48 hours after C-CEA (P < .0001). After E-CEA, however, renin and normetanephrine levels were unchanged at 24 hours, and metanephrine levels were increased (P < .0001). At 48 hours, levels of renin (P = .04), metanephrine (P < .0001), and normetanephrine (P = .02) were increased. Compared with C-CEA, E-CEA was associated with significantly increased sympathetic activity at 24 and 48 hours (P < .0001). Although the use of vasodilators for postoperative hypertension did not differ in the postanesthesia care unit (E-CEA 35% vs C-CEA 18%, P = .12), vasodilator use on the ward was more frequent after E-CEA (60% vs 32%, P = .02).\nE-CEA appears to be associated with greater postoperative sympathetic activity and vasodilator requirements than C-CEA, findings likely related to sacrifice of the carotid sinus nerve during E-CEA but not C-CEA.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms of restenosis in autogenous vein bypass grafts placed for peripheral artery disease are not completely understood. We investigated the role of hemodynamic stress in a case study of a revised bypass graft that failed due to restenosis.\nThe morphology of the lumen was reconstructed from a custom three-dimensional ultrasound system. Scans were taken at 1, 6, and 16 months after a patch angioplasty procedure. Computational hemodynamic simulations of the patient-specific model provided the blood flow features and the hemodynamic stresses on the vessel wall at the three times studied.\nThe vessel was initially free of any detectable lesions, but a 60% diameter-reducing stenosis developed during the 16-month study interval. As determined from the simulations, chaotic and recirculating flow occurred downstream of the stenosis due to the sudden widening of the lumen at the patch location. Curvature and a sudden increase in the lumen cross-sectional area induced these flow features that are hypothesized to be conducive to intimal hyperplasia. Favorable agreement was found between simulation results and in vivo Doppler ultrasound velocity measurements.\nTransitional and chaotic flow occurs at the site of the revision, inducing a complex pattern of wall shear as computed with the hemodynamic simulations. This supports the hypothesis that the hemodynamic stresses in the revised segment, produced by the coupling of vessel geometry and chaotic flow, led to the intimal hyperplasia and restenosis of the graft.",

    "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) in the presence of elevated levels of Smad3, its primary signaling protein, stimulates rat vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and intimal hyperplasia. The mechanism is partly through the nuclear exportation of phosphorylated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. The objective of this study is to clarify the downstream pathways through which Smad3 produces its proliferative effect. Specifically, we evaluated the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in TGF-\u03b2-induced VSMC proliferation.\nCultured rat aortic VSMCs were incubated with TGF-\u03b2 at varying concentrations and times, and phosphorylated ERK was measured by Western blotting. Smad3 was enhanced in VSMCs using an adenovirus expressing Smad3 or inhibited with small interfering RNA (siRNA). For in vivo experiments, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent carotid balloon injury, followed by intraluminal infection with an adenovirus expressing Smad3. Arteries were harvested at 3 days and subjected to immunohistochemistry for Smad3, phospho-ERK MAPK, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen.\nIn cultured VSMCs, TGF-\u03b2 induced activation and phosphorylation of ERK MAPK in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner. Overexpression of the signaling protein Smad3 enhanced TGF-\u03b2-induced activation of ERK MAPK, whereas inhibition of Smad3 with a siRNA blocked ERK MAPK phosphorylation in response to TGF-\u03b2. These data suggest that Smad3 acts as a signaling intermediate between TGF-\u03b2 and ERK MAPK. Inhibition of ERK MAPK activation with PD98059 completely blocked the ability of TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 to stimulate VSMC proliferation, demonstrating the importance of ERK MAPK in this pathway. Immunoprecipitation of phospho-ERK MAPK and blotting with Smad3 revealed a physical association, suggesting that activation of ERK MAPK by Smad3 requires a direct interaction. In an in vivo rat carotid injury model, overexpression of Smad3 resulted in an increase in phosphorylated ERK MAPK as well as increased VSMC proliferation as measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen.\nOur findings demonstrate a mechanism through which TGF-\u03b2 stimulates VSMC proliferation. Although TGF-\u03b2 has been traditionally identified as an inhibitor of proliferation, our data suggest that TGF-\u03b2 enhances VSMC proliferation through a Smad3/ERK MAPK signaling pathway. These findings at least partly explain the mechanism by which TGF-\u03b2 enhances intimal hyperplasia. Knowledge of this pathway provides potential novel targets that may be used to prevent restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Increasing aortic diameter is thought to be an important risk factor for acute type B aortic dissection (ABAD). However, some patients develop ABAD in the absence of aortic dilatation. In this report, we sought to characterize ABAD patients who presented with a descending thoracic aortic diameter <3.5 cm.\nWe categorized 613 ABAD patients enrolled in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection from 1996 to 2009 according to the aortic diameter <3.5 cm (group 1) and \u22653.5 cm (group 2). Demographics, clinical presentation, management, and outcomes of the two groups were compared.\nOverall, 21.2% (n = 130) had an aortic diameter <3.5 cm. Patients in group 1 were younger (60.5 vs 64.0 years; P = .015) and more frequently female (50.8% vs 28.6%; P < .001). They presented more often with diabetes (10.9% vs 5.9%; P = .050), history of catheterization (17.0% vs 6.7%; P = .001), and coronary artery bypass grafting (9.7% vs 3.4%; P = .004). Marfan syndrome was equally distributed in the two groups. The overall in-hospital mortality did not differ between groups 1 and 2 (7.6% vs 10.1%; P = .39).\nAbout one-fifth of patients with ABAD do not present with any aortic dilatation. These patients are more frequently females and younger, when compared with patients with aortic dilatation. This report is an initial investigation to clinically characterize this cohort, and further research is needed to identify risk factors for aortic dissection in the absence of aortic dilatation.",

    "abstract": "The underlying causes of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) remain obscure, although research tools such as the angiotensin II (Ang II) apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mouse model have aided investigations. Longitudinal imaging and determination of biomechanical forces in this small-scale model have been difficult. We hypothesized that high-frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy combined with speckle-tracking analytical strategies can be used to define the role of circumferential mechanical strain in AAA formation in the Ang II/apoE(-/-) mouse model of AAAs. We simultaneously examined dietary perturbations that might impact the biomechanical properties of the aortic wall, hypothesizing that the generalized inflammatory phenotype associated with diet-induced obesity would be associated with accelerated loss of circumferential strain and aneurysmal aortic degeneration.\nReceiving either a 60 kcal% fat Western diet or standard 10 kcal% fat normal chow, Ang II-treated apoE(-/-) mice (n = 34) underwent sequential aortic duplex ultrasound scan imaging (Vevo 2100 System; VisualSonics, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) of their entire aorta. Circumferential strains were calculated using speckle-tracking algorithms and a custom MatLab analysis.\nDecreased strains in all aortic locations after just 3 days of Ang II treatment were observed, and this effect progressed during the 4-week observation period. Anatomic segments along the aorta impacted wall strain (baseline highest in ascending aorta; P < .05), whereas diet did not. At 2 and 4 weeks, there was the largest progressive decrease in strain in the paravisceral/supraceliac aorta (P < .05), which was the segment most likely to be involved in aneurysm formation in this model.\nIn the Ang II/apoE(-/-) aneurysm model, the aorta significantly stiffens (with decreased strain) shortly after Ang II infusion, and this progressively continues through the next 4 weeks. High-fat feeding did not have an impact on wall strain. Delineation of biomechanical factors and AAA morphology via duplex scan and speckle-tracking algorithms in mouse models should accelerate insights into human AAAs.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of pharmacologic treatment with cilostazol and pentoxifylline on gait biomechanics of ischemic rat hindlimbs compared with nonischemic controls.\nAn experimental study was designed using 30 Wistar rats divided into five groups (n = 6): control (C); ischemia (I) - animals submitted to left common iliac artery interruption without pharmacologic treatment; pentoxifylline (Pen) - rats submitted to procedure and treated with pentoxifylline 3 mg/kg twice a day for 6 weeks; cilostazol (Cil) - animals submitted to procedure and treated with cilostazol 30 mg/kg twice a day for 6 weeks; and sham (S) - animals submitted to procedure without artery interruption. Gait analysis was performed using a computed treadmill. Time, number, and duration of each hindlimb contact were obtained. The total number of contacts (TNC) and the total duration of contacts (TDC) were compared between left and right hindlimb and among groups. Left hindlimb ischemic incapacitation index (LHII) was defined by the formula: LHII = (1-TNCleft x TDCleft / TNCright x TDCright) x 100.\nLeft hindlimb TNC values were twofold lower in I, Pen, and Cil groups than in C and S groups (P < .01). In I, Pen, and Cil groups, TNC values for the left hindlimb were half of the right hindlimb ones (P < .01). Left hindlimb TDC values were lower in I and Pen groups than the other groups (P < .01). Cil group presented twofold increased values, not different from C and S groups (P = 0.16). Right hindlimb TNC values were greater for I group (P < .01). LHII was around zero in C and S groups and 82 in both I and Pen groups (P < .01). Cil group presented a LHII of 42; higher than C and S groups, but lower than I and Pen groups (P < .01).\nCilostazol at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice a day promoted improvement in gait performance in rats submitted to chronic hindlimb ischemia. Pentoxifylline at a dose of 3 mg/kg twice a day did not show this effect.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying the symptomatic improvement witnessed as a result of exercise training in intermittent claudication remain unclear. There is no reproducible evidence to support increased limb blood flow resulting from neovascularization. Changes in oxygenation of active muscles as a result of blood redistribution are hypothesized but unproven. This study sought evidence of improved gastrocnemius oxygenation resulting from exercise training.\nThe study recruited 42 individuals with claudication. After an initial control period of exercise advice, participants undertook a 3-month supervised exercise program. Spatially resolved near-infrared spectroscopy monitored calf muscle oxygen saturation (Sto(2)) during exercise and after a period of cuff-induced ischemia. Comparison was made with 14 individuals undergoing angioplasty for calf claudication. Clinical outcomes of claudication distance and maximum walking distance were measured by treadmill assessment.\nSignificant increases occurred in mean [interquartile range] claudication disease (57 [38-78] to 119 [97-142] meters; P = .01) and maximum walking distance (124 [102-147] to 241 [193-265] meters; P = .02) after supervised exercise but not after the control period. No change occurred in resting Sto(2) at any interval. Angioplasty (27% [21-34] to 19% [13-29]; P = .02) but not exercise training (26% [21-32] vs 23% [20-31]; P > .20) resulted in a reduced Sto(2) desaturation in response to submaximal exercise and an increased hyperemic hemoglobin oxygen recovery rate after ischemia (0.48 [0.39-0.55] to 0.63 [0.52-0.69] s(-1); P = .01). However supervised exercise reduced the Sto(2) recovery half-time by 17% (82 [64-101] to 68 [55-89] seconds; P = .02).\nSupervised exercise training is not associated with increased gastrocnemius muscle oxygenation during exercise or increased hyperemic hemoglobin flow after a model of ischemia. This suggests that the symptomatic improvement witnessed is not the result of increased oxygen delivery to the active muscle. The enhanced recovery after exercise training therefore reflects a combination of enhanced metabolic economy and increased oxidative capacity, suggesting that exercise training helps reverse an acquired metabolic myopathy.",

    "abstract": "Current information regarding coverage of accessory renal arteries (ARAs) during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is based on small case series with limited follow-up. This study evaluates the outcomes of ARA coverage in a large contemporary cohort.\nConsecutive EVAR data from January 2004 to August 2010 were collected in a prospective database at a University Hospital. Patient and aneurysm-related characteristics, imaging studies, and ARA coverage versus preservation were analyzed. Volumetric analysis of three-dimensional reconstruction computed tomography scans was used to assess renal infarction volume extent. Long-term renal function and overall technical success of aneurysm exclusion were compared.\nA cohort of 426 EVARs was identified. ARAs were present in 69 patients with a mean follow-up of 27 months (range, 1 to 60 months). Forty-five ARAs were covered in 40 patients; 29 patients had intentional ARA preservation. Patient and anatomic characteristics were similar between groups except that ARA coverage patients had shorter aneurysm necks (P = .03). Renal infarctions occurred in 84% of kidneys with covered ARAs. There was no significant deterioration in long-term glomerular filtration rate when compared with patients in the control group. No difference in the rate of endoleak, secondary procedures, or the requirement for antihypertensive medications was found.\nThis study is the largest to date with the longest follow-up relating to ARA coverage. Contrary to previous reports, renal infarction after ARA coverage is common. Nevertheless, coverage is well tolerated based upon preservation of renal function without additional morbidity. These results support the long-term safety of ARA coverage for EVAR when necessary.",

    "abstract": "To date, history of a contralateral amputation as a potential predictor of outcomes after lower extremity bypass (LEB) for critical limb ischemia (CLI) has not been studied. We sought to determine if a prior contralateral lower extremity amputation predicts worse outcomes in patients undergoing LEB in the remaining intact limb.\nA retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing infrainguinal LEB for CLI between 2003 and 2010 within hospitals comprising the Vascular Study Group of New England was performed. Patients were stratified according to whether or not they had previously undergone a contralateral major or minor amputation before LEB. Primary end points included major amputation and graft occlusion at 1 year postoperatively. Secondary end points included in-hospital major adverse events, discharge status, and mortality at 1 year.\nOf 2636 LEB procedures, 228 (8.6%) were performed in the setting of a prior contralateral amputation. Patients with a prior amputation compared to those without were younger (66.5 vs 68.7; P = .034), more like to have congestive heart failure (CHF; 25% vs 16%; P = .002), hypertension (94% vs 85%; P = .015), renal insufficiency (26% vs 14%; P = .0002), and hemodialysis-dependent renal failure (14% vs 6%; P = .0002). They were also more likely to be nursing home residents (8.0% vs 3.6%; P = .036), less likely to ambulate without assistance (41% vs 80%; P < .0002), and more likely to have had a prior ipsilateral bypass (20% vs 12%; P = .0005). These patients experience increased in-hospital major adverse events, including myocardial infarction (MI; 8.9% vs 4.2%; P = .002), CHF (6.1% vs 3.4%; P = .044), deterioration in renal function (9.0% vs 4.7%; P = .006), and respiratory complications (4.2% vs 2.3%; P = .034). They were less likely to be discharged home (52% vs 72%; P < .0001) and less likely to be ambulatory on discharge (25% vs 55%; P < .0001). Although patients with a prior contralateral amputation experienced increased rates of graft occlusion (38% vs 17%; P < .0001) and major amputation (16% vs 7%; P < .0001) at 1 year, there was not a significant difference in mortality (16% vs 10%; P = .160). On multivariable analysis, prior contralateral amputation was an independent predictor of both major amputation (odds ratio, 1.73; confidence interval, 1.06-2.83; P = .027) and graft occlusion (odds ratio, 1.93; confidence interval, 1.39-2.68; P < .0001) at 1 year.\nPatients with prior contralateral amputations who present with CLI in the intact limb represent a high-risk population, even among patients with advanced peripheral arterial disease. When considering LEB in this setting, both physicians and patients should expect increased rates of perioperative adverse events, increased rates of 1-year graft occlusion, and decreased rates of limb salvage, when compared with patients who have not undergone a contralateral amputation.",

    "abstract": "Population-based screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in elderly men is organized in many regions and countries in the Western world, and the prevalence of disease is reported to decline. Whether the prevalence among those with a family history also is declining is unknown. The primary purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of AAAs among siblings of persons with AAAs and to investigate the proportion of siblings already diagnosed by opportunistic screening.\nPatients treated for AAAs from January 2008 through December 2010 (n = 412) in Stockholm, Sweden, were screened for siblings. Seven hundred seventy-nine siblings were identified. All siblings <80 years residing in Stockholm County were considered eligible and were invited to participate in the study (n = 174). Deceased siblings were not included in the study, regardless of the cause of death. One hundred fifty siblings were enrolled in the study after informed consent was provided. One hundred thirty-four siblings were screened for AAAs with ultrasound scan and maximum aortic, infrarenal, anteroposterior, external (outer-to-outer) aortic diameter was measured. Characteristics of siblings with and without AAAs were compared.\nThe mean age of the screened siblings was 66.4 years (standard deviation, 7.1). Of the siblings, 11% were found to have an AAA, 17% (n = 11) of the brothers, and 6% (n = 5) of the sisters. Only 11% of the siblings were screened for AAAs before the study. One of 16 siblings with AAAs was <65 years. Ever smoking was evident in 81% of the AAA siblings compared to 59% in the non-AAA siblings. Factors associated with increased risk of AAAs in the multivariate regression analysis were: male sex (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-10.8; P = .04) and age >65 (odds ratio, 10.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-86.4; P = .03). Ever smoking was not statistically significant as a risk.\nA strikingly high prevalence of AAAs in siblings was found as compared to the reported declining aneurysm prevalence in elderly men in the Western world. Systematic improvements regarding screening of first-degree relatives is mandated and selective screening of siblings is an underused tool to prevent death from aneurysm disease, both among men and women.",

Major adverse events evaluated included cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and spinal cord ischemia (SCI). Subgroup analysis was performed for noncovered LSA (group A), covered LSA (group B), and covered/revascularized LSA (group C).\nOf 1189 patients, 394 had LSA coverage (33.1%), and 180 of these patients (46%) underwent LSA revascularization. In all patients, emergency operations (9.5% vs 4.3%; P=.001), renal failure (12.7% vs 5.3%; P=.001), hypertension (7% vs 2.3%; P=.01), and number of stents placed (1=3.7%, 2=7.4%, \u22653=10%; P=.005) were predictors of SCI. History of cerebrovascular disease (9.6% vs 3.5%; P=.002), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (9.5% vs 5.4%; P=.01), coronary artery disease (8.5% vs 5.3%; P=.03), smoking (8.9% vs 4.2%) and female gender (5.3% men vs 8.2% women; P=.05) were predictors of CVA. Subgroup analysis showed no significant difference between groups B and C (SCI, 6.3% vs 6.1%; CVA, 6.7% vs 6.1%). LSA revascularization was not protective for SCI (7.5% vs 4.1%; P=.3) or CVA (6.1% vs 6.4%; P=.9). Women who underwent revascularization had an increased incidence of CVA event compared with all other subgroups (group A: 5.6% men, 8.4% women, P=.16; group B: 6.6% men, 5.3% women, P=.9; group C: 2.8% men, 11.9% women, P=.03).\nLSA coverage does not appear to result in an increased incidence of SCI or CVA event when a strategy of selective revascularization is adopted. Selective LSA revascularization results in similar outcomes among the three cohorts studied. Revascularization in women carries an increased risk of a CVA event and should be reserved for select cases.",

    "abstract": "During the past 2 decades, atherosclerosis and its clinical sequelae have increasingly been recognized as an inflammatory disease. Examination of multiple circulating inflammatory biomarkers has shown that they independently predict cardiovascular risk in patients with and without overt cardiovascular disease. Among these, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein has proved to be most robust in adding to global risk prediction models. Statins, a class of drugs that reduce levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and other inflammatory biomarkers, have been the most thoroughly studied anti-inflammatory agents to reduce cardiovascular risk. However, all such trials are necessarily confounded by the ability of statins to markedly reduce cholesterol, a well-known causal risk factor for adverse vascular outcomes. Nevertheless, the provocative results of several key statin trials have provided the scientific basis to test the hypothesis that reducing inflammation will improve cardiovascular outcomes with novel and specific anti-inflammatory agents. These newer drugs promise to reduce inflammatory marker levels without affecting lipids, glucose, or blood pressure. The results of these trials will provide key data to help us understand the relationship between inflammation and vascular risk.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there are no well-established duplex ultrasound (DUS) criteria for the evaluation of the mesenteric arteries after stenting for occlusive disease. Previous studies suggested DUS velocity criteria in the native superior mesenteric artery (SMA) overestimate stenosis in stented arteries, but most studies have not evaluated DUS imaging after SMA stenting longitudinally. This study was undertaken to determine the accuracy of DUS after mesenteric artery revascularization and, in particular, to evaluate the utility of DUS imaging for the detection of in-stent stenosis (ISS) of the SMA.\nA retrospective record review was performed for all patients who underwent SMA stenting for chronic mesenteric ischemia at a single institution from January 2004 to May 2011.\nMesenteric artery occlusive disease resulted in 24 patients undergoing mesenteric stenting of the SMA alone (n = 20) or the SMA and celiac artery simultaneously (n = 3). The mean \u00b1 standard deviation peak systolic velocity (PSV) in 13 prestent DUS images of the SMA was 464 \u00b1 130 cm/s. Prestenting angiography revealed an average SMA stenosis of 79% \u00b1 14%. After stenting, completion angiography in each case revealed <20% residual stenosis. No significant correlation was identified between SMA PSV and angiographic stenosis before and after stenting (P > .05). Follow-up SMA DUS imaging showed an average PSV of 335 \u00b1 138 cm/s at 0.9 \u00b1 1.5 months, 360 \u00b1 143 cm/s at 4.8 \u00b12.6 months, and 389 \u00b1 95 cm/s at 14.4 \u00b1 5.1 months. A significant difference existed between the prestent and the first poststent mean SMA PSV (P < .05), but no significant difference existed between each poststenting interval. Eight reinterventions for SMA ISS were performed, with a mean elevated in-stent SMA PSV of 505 \u00b1 74 vs 341 \u00b1 145 cm/s in patients who did not undergo reintervention. Angiography before the eight reinterventions demonstrated an average SMA ISS of 53% \u00b1 25%. In-stent SMA PSV decreased from 505 \u00b1 74 to 398 \u00b1 108 cm/s after the reintervention (P < .05).\nConsistent with other reports, our data demonstrate the PSV in successfully stented SMAs remains higher than the PSV threshold of 275 cm/s used for the diagnosis of high-grade native SMA stenosis. In addition, in-stent SMA PSVs did not significantly change over DUS surveillance for patients who did not undergo reintervention. Thus, obtaining a baseline DUS early after mesenteric stenting should be considered to compare future surveillance DUS. An increase above this baseline or an in-stent SMA PSV approaching 500 cm/s should be considered suspicious for ISS, but larger prospective studies will be required to validate these preliminary findings.",

    "results": "Mesenteric artery occlusive disease resulted in 24 patients undergoing mesenteric stenting of the SMA alone (n = 20) or the SMA and celiac artery simultaneously (n = 3). The mean \u00b1 standard deviation peak systolic velocity (PSV) in 13 prestent DUS images of the SMA was 464 \u00b1 130 cm/s. Prestenting angiography revealed an average SMA stenosis of 79% \u00b1 14%. After stenting, completion angiography in each case revealed <20% residual stenosis. No significant correlation was identified between SMA PSV and angiographic stenosis before and after stenting (P > .05). Follow-up SMA DUS imaging showed an average PSV of 335 \u00b1 138 cm/s at 0.9 \u00b1 1.5 months, 360 \u00b1 143 cm/s at 4.8 \u00b12.6 months, and 389 \u00b1 95 cm/s at 14.4 \u00b1 5.1 months. A significant difference existed between the prestent and the first poststent mean SMA PSV (P < .05), but no significant difference existed between each poststenting interval. Eight reinterventions for SMA ISS were performed, with a mean elevated in-stent SMA PSV of 505 \u00b1 74 vs 341 \u00b1 145 cm/s in patients who did not undergo reintervention. Angiography before the eight reinterventions demonstrated an average SMA ISS of 53% \u00b1 25%. In-stent SMA PSV decreased from 505 \u00b1 74 to 398 \u00b1 108 cm/s after the reintervention (P < .05).",

    "abstract": "Vascular malformations are a rare and complex group of lesions which may present serious pitfalls in diagnosis and management. We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of our imaging protocol and therapeutic algorithm in the treatment of low-flow and high-flow vascular malformations in a large series of patients.\nA prospective database of all patients treated by the multidisciplinary vascular malformation team at our institution between 2006 and 2011 was reviewed. Management decisions were based on patients' clinical profile as well as critical lesion characteristics, and included conservative care, sclerotherapy, embolization, surgical resection, or a combination of these modalities. Treatment goals and expectations were established by the patient and physician at the time of initial evaluation. An outcomes grading system based on patient- and physician-derived treatment goals and assessment of response to management was applied (1 = worse; 2 = unchanged, 3 = significantly improved, 4 = completely resolved), and postprocedural complications were identified.\nThe 136 vascular malformations in 135 patients included 59 (43.7%) males and 76 (56.3%) females, ranging in age from under 1 year to 68 years (mean, 25.3 \u00b1 17.0 years). In order to facilitate application of the therapeutic algorithm, all patients underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to determine critical lesion characteristics, including flow quality and lesion extension. Of the 105 low-flow vascular malformations (LFVM), 23 (21.9%) were managed conservatively, 38 (36.2%) were treated with sclerotherapy (sodium tetradecyl sulfate, polidocanol, and/or ethanol), 18 (17.1%) were surgically resected, and eight (7.6%) were managed with a combination of modalities. Of the 31 high-flow vascular malformations (HFVM), eight (25.8%) were managed conservatively, eight (25.8%) were treated with transcatheter arterial embolization, six (19.4%) required embolization followed by sclerotherapy, and five (16.1%) were primarily resected. Patients in all groups managed conservatively had minimal alteration in status. Response to sclerotherapy in the LFVM group resulted in improvement in 32 (84.2%) patients, surgical resection resulted in improvement in 16 (88.9%) patients, and combination therapy resulted in improvement in eight (100%) patients. Treatment with embolization in the HFVM group resulted in improvement in seven (87.5%) patients, while combination therapy resulted in improvement in six (100%), and surgical resection led to improvement in four (80%). Complications were observed in six (6.8%) patients treated for LFVMs (0 with sodium tetradecyl sulfate or polidocanol, four with ethanol, two with resection), and two (7.4%) patients treated for HFVMs with embolization or combination therapy.\nIn this large cohort of vascular malformation patients, implementation of the proposed diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms in a multidisciplinary setting resulted in favorable outcomes with an acceptable complication rate in this challenging patient population.",

    "abstract": "Chyloperitoneum is an uncommon but serious complication of abdominal aortic surgery. There are no optimal guidelines for the management of chyloperitoneum. We present here our experiences regarding the treatment of chyloperitoneum with somatostatin for three patients who underwent surgery for abdominal aortic disease. Milky, odorless liquid was observed in the abdominal drain of these patients. The conservative treatment with total parenteral nutrition failed; therefore, in parallel, we initiated a somatostatin treatment as a continuous perfusion. Drain loss decreased in all up to the second day of treatment. The probable mechanisms of the somatostatin decrease the intestinal absorption of fats via the specific receptors, decrease triglyceride concentration in the thoracic duct, and attenuate lymph flow in the major lymphatic channels. The presented cases showed successful treatment using somatostatin and may be a new generation of effective treatments for chyloperitoneum.",

    "abstract": "Aneurysms-osteoarthritis syndrome (AOS), caused by SMAD3 mutations, is a recently described autosomal-dominant syndrome characterized by arterial aneurysms, tortuosity, and aortic dissections in combination with osteoarthritis. Our objective was to evaluate the AOS-related vascular consequences in the visceral and iliac arteries and raise awareness for this aggressive syndrome among vascular specialists.\nAll AOS patients were monitored regularly according to our clinical AOS protocol. The study included those with one or more visceral aneurysms or tortuosity, or both. Clinical and surgical data were obtained from record abstraction.\nThe study included 17 AOS patients (47% men) aged 47\u00b113 years. A total of 73 aneurysms were encountered, of which 46 were located in the abdomen. The common iliac artery was most commonly affected (37%), followed by the superior mesenteric artery (15%), celiac trunk (11%), and splenic artery (9%). Rapid aneurysm growth\u22641 year was found in three arteries (gastric, hepatic, and vertebral artery). Furthermore, arterial tortuosity was noted in 94% of patients. Four patients underwent six elective (endo) vascular interventions for aneurysms in the iliac, hepatic, gastric, or splenic artery, without major perioperative or postoperative complications.\nAOS predisposes patients to widespread visceral and iliac artery aneurysms and extreme arterial tortuosity. Early elective aneurysm repair should be considered because the risk of aneurysm rupture is estimated to be very high and elective (endo) vascular interventions were not complicated by fragility of arterial tissue. Given the aggressive behavior of AOS, it is of utmost importance that vascular specialists are aware of this new syndrome.",

Due to the stent design (low radial force and lack of columnar support), significant risk of stent misalignment exists, which we have encountered in four out of 25 patients treated since 2005. Misalignment may result from excessive manipulation of the delivery system at the time of implantation or during catheter manipulation during adjunctive or secondary procedures. The manufacturer has modified the design of this device in order to prevent misalignment, although no serious clinical consequences of this misalignment have been reported with a mean follow-up of 50 months. Care with catheter manipulation after device deployment and accurate review of postoperative imaging are still warranted.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this investigation was to determine if the presence of ischemic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes in patients undergoing vascular surgery provides incremental prognostic information about the long-term risk of death compared with a single peak troponin level within 48 hours after surgery.\nThis was a retrospective analysis of 337 patients undergoing moderate-risk to high-risk vascular surgery at our institution whose ECG and biomarker data were complete. Peak cardiac troponin (cTn) I values that exceeded the upper reference limit (URL) were categorized as low-positive (+), at or exceeding the URL but less than three times the URL, or high-positive (+), at or exceeding three times the URL. ECGs were classified as ischemic or nonischemic. The primary outcome was death at 1 year after the vascular operation. Independent predictors of long-term mortality were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.\nThe most common vascular problem was an expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm (n=185 [55%]). With regard to cTnI, 53 patients (16%) were classified as high (+) and 82 (24%) as low (+). The ECG in 21 patients (6%) showed evidence of myocardial ischemia. An increase in 1-year mortality of 3% for normal, 11% for low (+), and 17% for high (+) (P<.01) was seen with incremental cTn values. Independent predictors of long-term mortality were age (odds ratio [OR], 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.07; P<.01), stratified troponin (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.25-2.10; P<.01), tissue loss (OR, 3.30; 95% CI, 1.72-6.33; P<.01), stratified Revised Cardiac Risk Index (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.97-1.81; P<.07), and statin use (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40-0.98; P=.04). The presence of ischemia on ECG was not a predictor of long-term mortality.\nIn the presence of an elevated cTn I, the ECG is not an independent predictor of long-term mortality after vascular surgery. These results support a strategy of routine surveillance of cTns after vascular surgery for the detection of cardiac events and postoperative risk stratification.",

    "abstract": "This study determined the incidence and characteristics of recurrent disease after femoropopliteal angioplasty, following either selective or routine stenting of diseased site(s).\nRetrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database for femoropopliteal interventions from June 2003 to July 2010 was performed. Interventions during this period were from a single institution, followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months after initial intervention and on a semiannual basis thereafter with clinical examinations and duplex ultrasound imaging. Two groups were identified: those with routine stenting (RS; routine stenting for all diseased areas) and those with selective stenting (SS; selective stenting for only segments which exhibited compromised flow from residual stenosis or significant dissection). Patients who developed recurrent symptoms (claudication, rest pain), a decrease in ankle-brachial index (ABI) (>0.2), or duplex documentation of a significant (>80%) recurrent stenosis underwent reintervention. Patient demographics, comorbidities, Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II classification, runoff, and degree of calcification (none, mild, moderate, severe) at initial intervention were recorded. The time to reintervention and recurrence pattern were recorded for both groups.\nDuring the study period, 746 endovascular interventions in 477 patients were performed. Total reintervention rate, including bypass, amputation, and asymptomatic occlusion after initial intervention, was 36.48% (group SS, 42.9%; group RS, 33.1%; P=.04). Of all initial interventions, 182 endovascular reinterventions in 165 patients for recurrent femoropopliteal disease were identified (group SS, 70; group RS, 95). No differences were noted among the groups in gender, comorbidities, initial TASC II classification, run off, calcification scores, or statin or clopidogrel use, or both. Time to recurrence was similar in the RS and SS groups. TASC II classification, runoff score, and degree of calcification were similar between the two groups. Although not statistically significant, analysis of recurrence pattern demonstrated de novo stenosis was more common in the SS group (50.0% vs 34.7%; P=.06).\nThis single-center retrospective study found a significant difference in the incidence of recurrence requiring reintervention between patients treated with selective and routine stenting for femoropopliteal disease. Analysis of endovascular reinterventions, however, reveals no significant difference in recurrence time or recurrence pattern between the two groups. No significant differences were identified in time to recurrence, TASC II classification, runoff, and calcification of endovascular reinterventions between the two groups' end points. Additional prospective studies to evaluate the roles of routine and selective stenting in symptomatic femoropopliteal peripheral arterial disease and to investigate recurrence lesion characteristics and the patency of multiple endovascular interventions between these two groups are needed.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous techniques for crossing femoropopliteal chronic total occlusions (CTOs) offer an alternative to bypass surgery in patients deemed to be at increased risk due to advanced age or comorbidities. Recent reports document good success rates in catheters designed to reconstitute peripherally occluded arteries following failed guidewire passage. The Wildcat catheter (Avinger, Redwood City, Calif) is a novel device with a rotating distal tip and deployable wedges fashioned for channeling a passage through arterial occlusions. This report describes the results of a prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of the Wildcat device when crossing de novo or restenotic femoropopliteal CTOs.\nBetween August 2010 and April 2011, patients with peripheral arterial disease due to a femoropopliteal CTO>1 cm and \u226435 cm were evaluated for study enrollment at 15 U.S. sites. During treatment, the physician initially attempted to cross the CTO using conventional guidewires per protocol; if the guidewire successfully crossed, the patient was considered a screen failure and the Wildcat was not deployed. At 30 days, patients were reevaluated. The primary efficacy end point was successful crossing of the Wildcat into the distal true lumen as confirmed by angiography. Primary safety end points included no in-hospital or 30-day major adverse events, no clinically significant perforation or embolization, and no grade C or greater dissection. Additional data collected included lesion length, degree of calcification, and location.\nEighty-eight patients were enrolled in the trial. Of these, the Wildcat device was used in 84 patients (95%) per protocol. Successful CTO crossing was reported and confirmed by independent review in 89% (75/84) of cases with 5% (4/84) major adverse events as defined in the protocol (predominantly perforations sealed with balloon inflation). There were no clinically relevant events associated with any of the perforations. The mean CTO length was 174\u00b196 mm (range, 15-350 mm). Approximately 57% (n=48) of all lesions were categorized as containing at least moderate calcification. Eighty-nine percent (n=75) of vessels recanalized were superficial femoral arteries.\nIn this multicenter study, the Wildcat catheter demonstrated an 89% crossing success rate with little associated morbidity. The Wildcat catheter is a viable device for crossing moderately calcified femoropopliteal CTOs.",

We therefore explored trends in amputation among Medicare diabetic patients with a focus on those at highest risk.\nThe Diabetes Analytical File, an enhanced sample of all diabetic patients from the Medicare 5% sample, was used to study the national incidence of amputation in diabetic patients. Within a cohort of \u223c5 million diabetic patients between 1999 and 2006, we compared the incidence of amputation in high-risk (end-stage renal disease or more than three comorbidities) and low-risk groups and by race.\nBetween 1999 and 2006, 23,976 amputations were performed, comprising 11,558 in high-risk and 12,418 in low-risk patients. The amputation rate declined over time from 4.8/1000 in 1999 to 4.4/1000 in 2006 (P<.001). High-risk patients represented a growing proportion of all amputations (33% in 1999, 50% in 2006; P<.001) despite representing 4% of diabetic patients in 1999 and 10% in 2006 (P<.001). The incidence of amputation was 29.6/1000 in the high-risk group vs 2.7/1000 in low-risk patients (P<.001). African Americans had higher rates of amputation in high-risk and low-risk groups.\nHigh-risk patients represent a minority of Medicare diabetic patients but account for 50% of all amputations, and this effect is magnified in African Americans. Future quality improvement efforts should focus on high-risk patients and African Americans.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is almost invariably associated with a generalized atherosclerotic involvement of the arterial tree and endothelial dysfunction. Previous short-term studies showed improvement of vascular reactivity and walking capacity in PAD patients by measures aimed at restoring nitric oxide (NO) production. NO is also known to prevent the progression of atherosclerosis. We wished to assess whether the prolonged administration of an NO-donating agent (NCX 4016) improves the functional capacity of PAD patients and affects the progression of atherosclerosis as assessed by carotid intima-media thickness (IMT).\nThis prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 442 patients with stable intermittent claudication who were randomized to NCX 4016 (800 mg, twice daily) or its placebo for 6 months. The primary study outcome was the absolute claudication distance on a constant treadmill test (10% incline, 3 km/h). The main secondary end point was the change of the mean far-wall right common carotid artery IMT.\nThe increase of absolute claudication distance at 6 months compared with baseline was 126\u00b1140 meters in the placebo-treated group and 117\u00b1137 meters in the NCX 4016-treated group, with no significant differences. Carotid IMT increased in the placebo-treated group (+0.01\u00b10.01 mm; P=.55) and decreased in the NCX 4016-treated group (-0.03\u00b10.01 mm; P=.0306). Other secondary end points did not differ between the two treatments.\nLong-term NO donation does not improve the claudication distance but does reduce progression of atherosclerosis in patients with PAD. Further studies aimed at assessing whether long-term NO donation may prevent ischemic cardiovascular events are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Lower extremity computed tomography angiography (CTA) is frequently used for anatomic assessment of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease. When lower extremity bypass is planned, duplex ultrasound (DUS) is routinely obtained to evaluate the great saphenous vein (GSV) for use as conduit. Although GSV can be visualized on CTA images, diameter assessment is not routinely included in formal study interpretation. We hypothesized that CTA images could be used to measure GSV diameters and that CTA-based diameters would correlate with measurements obtained using DUS.\nConsecutive patients undergoing lower extremity arterial bypass who were evaluated preoperatively with both CTA and DUS vein mapping were identified at a single hospital. Minimum above- and below-knee GSV diameters were measured from electronically archived CTA images by two independent observers. CTAs were performed using standard arterial phase protocol without additional venous phase imaging. Between-observer reproducibility of CTA-based diameter measurements was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients. Correlation between CTA and DUS-based GSV diameters was evaluated with Spearman correlation coefficients. CTA diameter cut-points for identification of adequate GSV bypass conduit, defined as DUS-based minimum GSV diameter\u22653 mm, were determined using receiver-operating characteristic curves.\nSixty-three lower extremities were evaluated in 36 patients. In the absence of previous surgical removal, GSV was visible on all CTAs reviewed. No instances of GSV thrombosis were identified on DUS. Minimum DUS-based above-knee GSV diameter was 2.9\u00b10.1 mm (range, 1.4-4.6 mm), and mean below-knee diameter was 2.6\u00b10.1 mm (range, 1.3-4.0 mm). When GSV was visible and exceeded the minimum diameter threshold for CTA measurement, correlation between CTA- and DUS-based diameters was both positive and highly significant (\u03c1=0.595; P<.0001). CTA-based diameters also had excellent reliability between observers (r [95% CI]: 0.88 [0.85-0.91]). For identification of adequate bypass conduit using CTA, above-knee GSV diameter\u22653.9 mm was 67% sensitive and 73% specific; below-knee GSV diameter\u22653.0 mm was 75% sensitive and 84% specific.\nCTA-based GSV diameter measurements have good reproducibility and highly significant correlation with DUS-based diameters. CTA-based GSV diameter is a specific but relatively insensitive indicator of adequate bypass conduit. When CTA-based diameters indicate inadequate GSV bypass conduit, confirmatory DUS vein mapping is warranted. Confirmatory DUS vein mapping may be unnecessary when adequate vein diameter is identified on CTA.",

    "abstract": "Fenestrated-branched stent grafts have been developed as a minimally invasive, endovascular alternative for the treatment of complex aortic aneurysms in high-risk patients. However, the manufacture of these devices can take as long as 6 to 12 weeks, and therefore, they cannot be used to treat aortic emergencies. We reviewed our experience with surgeon-modified, fenestrated-branched stent grafts (sm-FBSGs) in high-risk patients who presented as emergencies with ruptured or symptomatic complex aortic aneurysms.\nAll patients treated with sm-FBSGs at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patients presenting with acute symptoms or an emergency indication for repair were analyzed.\nTwelve high-risk patients (nine men), of which seven were at American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 and five were at class 3, presented with seven symptomatic and five ruptured aortic aneurysms. Mean age was 71 years (range, 52-86 years), and mean maximal aneurysm size was 8.1 cm (range, 5-12 cm). Six patients (50%) had prior aortic surgery or a hostile abdomen. Relevant comorbidities included coronary disease in all 12 patients, and seven (58%) had an ejection fraction\u226435%. Nine patients (75%) had severe pulmonary dysfunction. Four aneurysms were pararenal, and eight were thoracoabdominal (two type II, three type III, and three type IV). An average of three visceral vessels (range, 2-4) were treated per patient, with 35 branches targeted. Endografts were successfully implanted in all patients. There was no paraplegia or intraoperative death. One patient (8.3%) died of subarachnoid hemorrhage\u226430 days. Reintervention was necessary in two patients, for a type 3 endoleak and for evacuation of a retroperitoneal hematoma. Morbidity included one myocardial infarction, and two patients each with transient respiratory failure and transient renal insufficiency not requiring dialysis. Mean postoperative length of stay was 4 days in the intensive care unit and 8 days in the hospital. At a mean follow-up of 9 months (range, 3-18 months), two patients died of non-aneurysm-related causes. Branch vessel patency was 100%. No late reinterventions were necessary. No type I or III endoleaks occurred. One type II endoleak is under observation.\nSm-FBSG may play an important role in the treatment of select patients with symptomatic or ruptured complex aortic aneurysms who are at prohibitive risk for open surgery and in whom endovascular repair cannot be delayed to allow implantation of a custom-made commercial device. Until an off-the-shelf fenestrated-branched device is created that does not require a prolonged waiting period, this may be the best option to treat patients with symptomatic or ruptured complex aneurysms that are at excessively high surgical risk.",

    "abstract": "Concurrent iliac occlusion and abdominal aortic aneurysm is rare. Traditionally, the endovascular approach to these patients has consisted of aortouniiliac devices combined with femoral-femoral bypass. With improved facility of endovascular techniques, standard bifurcated endografts represent an alternative option in these patients. This study examined outcomes of patients undergoing iliac recanalization and traditional bifurcated endovascular aneurysm repair in the face of access vessel occlusion.\nOutcomes of patients at three academic tertiary referral centers who underwent attempted iliac recanalization of chronic iliac occlusions and concurrent endovascular aneurysm repair of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with acute iliac thrombosis and those with severely stenotic (but patent) iliac vessels were excluded.\nDuring a 6-year period, 15 occluded iliac arteries were treated in 14 patients (13 men). Mean age was 67.8 years (range, 52-80 years). Primary indication for intervention was disabling claudication in four patients, size of abdominal aortic aneurysm in nine, and symptomatic aneurysm in one. Seven patients presented with a unilateral common iliac artery (CIA) occlusion, four with a unilateral external iliac artery (EIA) occlusion, three with a unilateral combined CIA and EIA occlusion, and one with bilateral CIA occlusions. Stents had been placed previously in two of the occluded CIAs and in one of the occluded EIAs. Average length of the occluded segment was 7.5 cm (range, 2-17 cm). The occluded CIAs and EIAs had mean diameters of 8.6 and 5.7 mm, respectively. Successful recanalization was achieved in 14 of the 15 vessels (93.3%). One EIA ruptured during recanalization but was easily controlled with a covered stent. A re-entry device was used in two cases. Overall, 13 bifurcated devices were successfully implanted. Bilateral iliac occlusions in one patient were recanalized. One Talent (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif), eight Excluder (W. L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz), and four Zenith (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) devices were used. Mean length of stay was 2.3 days (range, 1-6 days). No major perioperative complications or deaths occurred. During a mean follow-up of 28.2 months (range, 1-86 months), there was 100% primary patency of successfully recanalized iliac arteries. Aneurysm sac size decreased from a mean of 5.1 cm (range, 3.1-7.6 cm) preoperatively to 4.4 cm (range, 2.8-7.1 cm) at follow-up. No aneurysms grew or ruptured. Three type II endoleaks occurred, one of which required coiling at 15 months. Two late deaths occurred: one at 36 months secondary to complications from a coronary artery bypass graft/mitral valve replacement and one at 34 months from a myocardial infarction.\nThe use of bifurcated endovascular devices after recanalization of an occluded iliac system is technically feasible and durable at midterm follow-up. This technique re-establishes aortoiliac inflow to both lower extremities, obviates the need for extra-anatomic bypass, and may preserve hypogastric perfusion in some patients.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular matrix dysregulation in the aortic media has been considered as the intrinsic factor for the formation of thoracic aortic dissection. However, the mechanisms of extracellular matrix disorders in the dissected aortic media remain unclear. This study was designed to investigate the relevance between smooth muscle cell phenotypes and extracellular matrix disorders in the dissected media. Their interaction may account for the pathogenesis of thoracic aortic dissection.\nThoracic aortic samples were collected from 10 patients with thoracic aortic dissection and 10 controls. Primary cultures of aortic medial smooth muscle cells were obtained with optimized explant technique. In this study, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 2, and smoothelin were applied as the contractile phenotypic markers and osteopontin was applied as the synthetic marker. Compared with controls, immunostaining and immunoblotting demonstrated that in vivo expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 2, and smoothelin were significantly decreased in the dissected media, whereas that of osteopontin was elevated (P<.01 for all). In vitro expression of the phenotypic markers showed the similar patterns. Furthermore, smooth muscle cells derived from the dissected media exhibited enhanced proliferation (P<.01), increased collagens I and III synthesis (2.6- and 4.4-fold, respectively; P<.01 for both), and elevated matrix metalloproteinase-2 production (4.2-fold; P<.01). Consistently, the protein levels of type I and III collagens and matrix metalloproteinase-2 in the dissected media were raised by 4.6-, 4.0-, and 3.7-fold, respectively (P<.01 for all). Collagen deposition was correspondingly increased and elastic fibers were decreased and disrupted.\nSmooth muscle cells in the dissected media exhibit phenotypic switching from the contractile to the synthetic type. The synthetic smooth muscle cells increase collagen synthesis and matrix metalloproteinase-2 production, both of which can promote collagen deposition and elastin degradation in thoracic aortic dissection.",

    "abstract": "Transfemoral carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been associated with a high incidence of embolic phenomena and silent brain infarction. The goal of this study was to compare the incidence of new ischemic cerebral lesions on diffusion-perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences after transcervical CAS performed with carotid flow reversal vs stenting via transfemoral approach with distal filter protection.\nDuring a 26-month period, 64 consecutive patients diagnosed with significant carotid stenosis by ultrasound imaging were assigned to transcervical CAS with carotid flow reversal or a transfemoral approach with a distal filter. The Rankin stroke scale was administered by an independent neurologist, and diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) studies were performed \u226424 hours before and \u226424 to 48 hours after the procedure. DW-MRI studies were compared by two neuroradiologists not involved in the study and blinded for time, clinical status, and treatment option. Hyperintense DW-MRI signals found after the procedure were interpreted as postoperative ischemic infarcts. All patients were assessed at 1, 6, and 12 months after the intervention.\nThe distribution of demographic and pathologic variables was similar in both groups. All procedures were technically successful, with a mean carotid flow reversal time of 22 minutes. Twenty-one (70%) and 23 patients (69.69%) were symptomatic in the transcervical and transfemoral groups, respectively (P=.869). After intervention, new postprocedural DW-MRI ischemic infarcts were found in four transcervical (12.9%) and in 11 transfemoral (33.3%) patients (P=.03), without new neurologic symptoms. No major adverse events occurred at 30 days after the intervention. All patients remained neurologically intact, without an increase in stroke scale scoring. All stents remained patent, and all patients remained stroke-free during follow-up. In multivariate analysis, age (relative risk [RR], 1.022; P<.001), symptomatic status (RR, 4.109; P<.001), and open-cell vs closed-cell stent design (RR, 2.01; P<.001) were associated with a higher risk of embolization in the transfemoral group but not in the transcervical group.\nThese data suggest that transcervical carotid stenting with carotid flow reversal carries a significantly lower incidence of new ischemic brain infarcts than that resulting from transfemoral CAS with a distal filter. The transcervical approach with carotid flow reversal may improve the safety of CAS and has the potential to improve results in especially vulnerable patients such as the elderly and symptomatic.",

    "abstract": "Successful adaptation of a vein graft to an arterial environment is incompletely understood. We sought to investigate whether early vein graft remodeling is predictive of subsequent patency.\nA prospective longitudinal study was conducted of 67 patients undergoing lower extremity bypass with autogenous vein between February 2004 and April 2008. Preoperative blood samples were drawn for biomarkers. During the bypass operation, a 5-cm index segment of the graft was registered for serial lumen diameter measurements at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months using duplex ultrasound imaging. The imaging substudy analysis included patients with at least two ultrasound assessments.\nPatients (55% male) were a median age of 70 years (interquartile range [IQR], 59-76 years), 40% had diabetes mellitus, 49% had critical limb ischemia, 75% were taking a statin, and 91% were taking an antiplatelet medication. Median follow-up was 32 months (IQR, 15-47 months). The median baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level (hsCRP) was 3.2 mg/L (IQR, 1.4-9.7 mg/L). The average intraoperative, postimplantation vein lumen diameter was 3.9\u00b11.0 mm, increasing to 4.7\u00b11.1 mm at 1 month, an average 24%\u00b127% change per patient. By 3 months, the average lumen diameter was 5.1\u00b11.6 mm, with little subsequent change observed to 12 months. Nonwhite race, baseline hsCRP \u22655 mg/L, statin use, and initial lumen diameter were significantly associated with early (0- to 1-month) vein remodeling in a multivariable regression model. The primary patency rate for the cohort was 60%\u00b16.3% at 2 years. Initial lumen diameter of the index segment was not associated with primary patency, whereas larger lumen diameter achieved at 1 month (\u22655.1 mm) was positively associated with primary patency (log-rank, P=.03). Early (30-day) remodeling behavior was used to divide patients into \"poor remodelers\" (<-5% lumen diameter change, n=6), \"modest remodelers\" (-5% to 25% change, n=29), and \"robust remodelers\" (>+25% change, n=30). Early remodeling category was significantly associated with primary patency rate at 2 years (log-rank, P=.02). A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model showed that modest remodelers (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-15; P=.04) and poor remodelers (hazard ratio, 13; 95% confidence interval; P=.008) had significantly higher hazard ratios for graft failure than robust early remodelers.\nEarly remodeling of the arterialized vein appears to predict midterm bypass graft patency. In addition to baseline diameter, race, inflammation, hsCRP, and statin use are associated with early adaptive remodeling, but the mechanisms for these observations are not understood.",

    "abstract": "The natural history of patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) undergoing hemodialysis access placement is unknown. MetS has previously been found as a risk factor for poor outcomes for vascular surgery patients undergoing other interventions. The aim of this is study is to describe the outcomes of MetS patients undergoing primary hemodialysis access placement.\nThe medical records of the 187 patients who underwent hemodialysis access placement between 1999 and 2009 at the Veterans Administration Connecticut Healthcare System were reviewed. Survival, primary patency, and secondary patency were evaluated using the Gehan-Breslow test for survival. MetS was defined as the presence of three or more of the following: blood pressure\u2265130/90 mm Hg; triglycerides\u2265150 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein\u226450 mg/dL for women and \u226440 mg/dL for men; body mass index\u226530 kg/m2; or fasting blood glucose\u2265110 mg/dL.\nOf the 187 patients who underwent hemodialysis access placement, 115 (61%) were identified to have MetS. The distribution of MetS factors among all patients was hypertension in 98%, diabetes in 58%, elevated triclyceride in 39%, decreased high-density lipoprotein in 60%, elevated body mass index in 36%, and 39% were currently receiving hemodialysis. Patients were a mean age of 66 years. The median length of follow-up was 4.2 years. The forearm was site of fistula placement in 53%; no difference existed between groups (MetS, 57%; no MetS, 50%; P=.388). The median time to primary failure was 0.46 years for all patients (MetS, 0.555 years; no MetS, 0.436 years; P=.255). Secondary patency was 50% at 1.18 years for all patients (no MetS, 1.94 years; MetS, 0.72 years; P=.024). Median survival duration for all patients was 4.15 years (no MetS, 5.07 years; MetS, 3.63 years; P=.019).\nMetS is prevalent among patients undergoing hemodialysis access placement. Patients with MetS have equivalent primary patency rates; however, their survival and cumulative patency rates are significantly lower than in patients without MetS. Patients with MetS form a high-risk group that needs intensive surveillance protocols.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-engineered blood vessels (TEBV) have been proposed as an alternative to prosthetic grafts for dialysis access. However, arteriovenous (AV) grafts must withstand extreme flow rates and frequent needle trauma. In a proof-of-concept study, we sought to determine whether scaffold-based TEBV could withstand the hemodynamic and mechanical challenges of chronic dialysis access.\nTEBV were constructed using decellularized arterial scaffolds seeded with autologous ovine endothelial cells (EC) derived from circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) using a novel high-affinity capture approach. Seeded scaffolds were preconditioned to arterial pressure and flow in a bioreactor for 2 weeks prior to implantation to create carotid artery to jugular vein AV grafts in each animal. TEBV were healed for 1 month before initiating percutaneous needle puncture 3 days/week. TEBV wall geometry and patency were monitored using duplex imaging and were either explanted for histologic analysis at 2 months (n = 5) or followed for up to 6 months until venous outflow stenosis threatened AV graft patency (n = 6).\nDespite high flow, TEBV maintained stable geometry with only modest wall dilation (under 6%) by 4 months after implantation. Needle access was well tolerated with a single puncture site complication, a small pseudoaneurysm, occurring in the late group. Time-to-hemostasis at puncture sites averaged 4 \u00b1 2 minutes. Histologic analysis at 2 months demonstrated repopulation of the outer TEBV wall by host cells and healing of needle punctures by cellular ingrowth and new matrix deposition along the tract. TEBV followed beyond 2 months showed stable wall geometry but, consistent with the primary mode of clinical AV graft failure, all TEBV eventually developed venous anastomotic stenosis (mean, 4.4 \u00b1 0.9 months; range, 3.3-5.6 months postimplantation; n = 6).\nThis pilot study supports the concept of creating dialysis access from scaffold-based autologous TEBV. Engineered AV grafts were created within a clinically relevant time frame and demonstrated stable wall geometry despite high flow and repeated puncture. Cellular ingrowth and puncture site healing may improve wall durability, but venous outflow stenosis remains the primary mode of TEBV graft failure in the ovine model.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesized that the general inflammation observed in the wall of large, asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) could be detected in vivo by 18-fluorodeoxglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) and, if so, that this method could be used to study if active inflammation is an early pathogenetic finding in small AAAs detected by screening.\nIn this prospective clinical study, 12 men were examined with FDG-PET computed tomography. Seven had large asymptomatic AAAs (range, 52-66 mm) that required surgery, and five had small AAAs (range, 34-40 mm) under surveillance. In the surgery group, biopsy specimens were taken from the aneurysm wall for histologic examinations.\nCompared with normal segments of the aorta, liver, and blood and compared with healthy controls matched for age and sex, no increased FDG uptake, measured as standardized uptake value, was detected in any of the large or small AAAs. The SUV(mean) difference between infrarenal aorta and blood was -0.3 for cases and -0.1 for controls (P = .06). The corresponding differences between the infrarenal aorta and liver was -0.8 and -0.8 (P = .91) and between infrarenal aorta and suprarenal aorta was -0.2 and -0.1 for cases and controls, respectively (P = .20). The histologic examination of the aneurysm walls showed high inflammatory cell infiltration with T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and macrophages.\nThe chronic inflammation observed in the wall of asymptomatic AAAs was not sufficiently metabolically active to result in an increased glucose metabolism detectable by FDG-PET by means of this standard protocol. To study the importance of inflammation in the pathogenesis of AAAs in vivo, PET tracers other than FDG need to be developed.",

    "abstract": "Vascular malformations are uncommon but may confer significant morbidity. Limitations in diagnosis and treatment result from inadequate classification schema and diagnostic algorithms. The crucial distinction is between high-flow and low-flow lesions because this informs prognosis and treatment. This study assessed the utility of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (dceMRI) in distinguishing high-flow from low-flow lesions, a technique that has previously not been widely applied or evaluated in this patient population.\nA prospective database of all patients referred to the multidisciplinary vascular malformation team at our institution was reviewed from January 2006 to June 2010. dceMRI was obtained on each patient to determine flow characteristics and lesion extent. Additional studies were used as indicated. Catheter-based arteriography was performed when high-flow lesions were identified with the intention of intervening or to distinguish between high-flow and low-flow lesions when MRI was indeterminate. A triage algorithm was used to stratify patients and formulate therapeutic goals. We analyzed the accuracy of dceMRI in identifying high-flow and low-flow lesions.\nThe study included 122 patients (aged <1 to 70 years) comprising 52 males (42.6%) and 70 females (57.4%). Pain (72 patients; 59%) and swelling (88 patients; 72.1%) were the most common presenting symptoms. All patients underwent dceMRI. Of these, 68 had confirmatory imaging (n = 15) or intervention (n = 53). The dceMRI was able to definitively and correctly distinguish high-flow from low-flow lesions in 57 studies, for an accuracy rate of 83.8%. In the remaining 11 studies, dceMRI correctly queried flow status but not definitively, and confirmatory angiography was required.\nUsing a diagnostic tool designed to identify key clinical characteristics, we were able to successfully distinguish between high-flow and low-flow vascular malformations using dceMRI alone in 83.8% of patients, minimizing the need for unnecessary invasive catheter-based procedures.",

    "abstract": "Anatomic factors may limit the application of stent grafts for the treatment of arterial aneurysms. Flow- diverting stents (FDSs) are specially designed to reduce flow velocity in the aneurysm sac and promote thrombosis while maintaining flow in the main artery and branch vessels. FDSs include the Pipeline Embolization Device (ev3, Plymouth, Minn), the SILK Arterial Reconstruction Device (Balt Extrusion, Montmorency, France), and the Cardiatis Multilayer Stent (Cardiatis, Isnes, Belgium). The first two have been mainly used for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. The aim of this study was to review the current role of FDSs in the treatment of extracranial arterial aneurysms.\nA systematic electronic health database search was conducted using PubMed, Ovid, Medline, and the Cochrane Database on all accessible published articles through March 2012. An additional search for abstracts presented in international congresses for vascular surgery was also performed. Full-text articles and abstracts were analyzed separately due to the heterogeneity of the data.\nResults of the use of FDSs in arterial aneurysms were reported in 12 full-text articles including 35 patients (26 men, age 65.4) with 38 aneurysms. The aneurysms were located in the hepatic (n = 12), splenic (n = 6), renal (n = 5), celiac (n = 4), superior mesenteric (n = 3), subclavian (n = 2), gastroduodenal (n = 1), and popliteal arteries (n = 1) and in the descending thoracic (n = 1), suprarenal (n = 1) and infrarenal aorta (n = 2). The 30-day mortality was 5.7% (2 of 35 patients). Three stent thromboses occurred (8.3%), none of them with clinical consequences. Thirty patients with 33 aneurysms and patent FDSs were monitored for an average of 9.2 months. Thrombosis occurred in 90.6%, and volume reduction was observed in 81% of the aneurysms. No branch vessel occlusion occurred. Twelve abstracts were identified, including 133 patients (mean age, 64.7 years). They included 62 peripheral, 28 visceral, and 43 abdominal and thoracoabdominal aneurysms. The Cardiatis Multilayer Stent was used in all cases. Thrombosis was achieved in all but two peripheral and visceral aneurysms. Volume reduction was observed in 82.7%, and no branch vessel occlusion occurred. In aortic aneurysms, better results regarding aneurysm thrombosis, reduction of the volume, and patency of collateral branches were reported at 12 months rather than at 6 months postoperatively. No aneurysm rupture has yet been described.\nInitial clinical experience with the use of FDSs in the treatment of visceral and peripheral aneurysms yielded satisfactory results in technical success, aneurysm thrombosis and shrinkage, and in patency of branch vessels. The results in aortic aneurysms are still under investigation. No aneurysm rupture has yet been described. There is a significant incidence of FDS thrombosis. Volume reduction of the aneurysm is a clearer evidence of the clinical success after treatment with FDSs than aneurysm thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Simulation technology has a well-defined role in nonmedical professions such as aviation and over the last two decades has permeated medical training. The most successful surgical simulation is in the fields of laparoscopic and endovascular surgery. These two-dimensional scenarios, as in the aviation industry, lend themselves to simulation. Open simulators have been met with more resistance than their laparoscopic counterparts because of the difficulties in simulating the three-dimensional field. Engaging in persistent practice is what makes the expert and all trainees should aspire to this. Without knowing, all surgical trainees have engaged in deliberate practice when first learning to tie surgical knots. This deliberate practice should be used in all aspects of vascular surgical practice, and it is no longer acceptable to perform procedures such as arterial anastomoses for the first time on patients. Simulators exist for all aspects of vascular surgical training and vary in complexity and price. Some of these simulators are suitable for use at home or in a skills laboratory whereas others are more suitable for use in a specialized skills center. Training on these simulators can be offered at a local level or at a regional level in the skills center. Where surgical procedures are not commonly performed or expertise is required for a new innovation, it is more appropriate to have national or internationally based workshops under the auspices of surgical boards or societies. Simulation of crisis management, well known in aviation, has also been applied to vascular surgical practice and can offer benefit to senior trainees even when their performance on a noncrisis simulator has reached a plateau. This article identifies the areas where simulation in open vascular surgery can benefit the trainee.",

Malformation of the inferior vena cava (IVC), although rare and frequently asymptomatic, may also result in left renal vein hypertension, with resultant hematuria when it is severely compressed. We report a 20-year-old man with persistent hematuria due to compression of left-sided IVC. The patient was successfully treated by means of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) transposition and division of the fibrous bundle at the origin of the SMA. His postoperative course was uneventful. Compression of the left IVC is a unique form of nutcracker syndrome. SMA transposition, together with division of a fibrous bundle at the origin of the SMA if present, is a safe and effective surgical procedure for this special entity.",

    "abstract": "Blunt abdominal aortic injury (BAAI) is very rare, and current literature is limited to case series of single-center experience. Through an analysis of the National Trauma Data Bank, the largest aggregation of United States trauma registry data, our aim was to characterize the associated injury pattern, contemporary management, and in-hospital outcomes of patients with BAAI.\nWe used a nested case-control design. The overall cohort consisted of adult patients (age \u2265 16 years) severely injured (Injury Severity Score \u2265 16) after blunt trauma who were treated at a level 1 or 2 trauma center in years 2007 to 2009. Cases were patients with BAAI and were frequency-matched by age group and mechanism to randomly selected controls at a one-to-five ratio. Multivariable matched analysis (conditional logistic regression) was used to derive adjusted measures of association between BAAI and adjacent arterial, intra-abdominal, and bony injuries.\nWe identified 436 patients with BAAI from 180 centers. The mean Injury Severity Score was 35 \u00b1 14, and most patients were injured in motor vehicle crashes (84%). Multivariable analysis showed injury to the thoracic aorta, renal and iliac artery, small bowel, colon, liver, pancreas, and kidney, as well as lumbar spine fractures were independently associated with BAAI. A total of 394 patients (90%) were managed nonoperatively, and 42 (10%) underwent repair. Of these 42 patients, 29 (69%) underwent endovascular repair, with 11 patients undergoing open aortic repair and two extra-anatomic bypasses. Median time from admission to repair was 1 day (interquartile range, 1-2 days). Overall mortality was 29%. A total of 271 (69%) patients managed nonoperatively survived to hospital discharge.\nThe index of suspicion for BAAI should be raised in severely injured patients by the presence of injuries to the lumbar spine, bowel, retroperitoneal organs, and adjacent major arteries. Although endovascular repair is the most common intervention, most patients are managed nonoperatively and survive to hospital discharge.",

    "abstract": "Owing to the difficulty of removing acute and chronic thrombus from autogenous accesses (AA) by standard surgical and endovascular techniques, many surgeons consider efforts to salvage a thrombosed AA as being futile. We describe a simple technique to extract acute and chronic thrombus from a failed AA. This technique involves making an incision adjacent to the anastomosis, directly extracting the arterial plug, and manually milking thrombus from the access. This report details the outcomes of a series of thrombosed AAs treated by surgical thrombectomy/intervention using this technique for manual clot extraction.\nA total of 146 surgical thrombectomies/interventions were performed in 102 patients to salvage a thrombosed AA. Mean follow-up was 15.6 months. Office, hospital, and dialysis unit records were reviewed to identify patient demographics, define procedure type, and determine functional patency rates. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate primary and secondary functional patency rates.\nComplete extraction of thrombus from the AA was achieved in 140 of 146 cases (95%). The studied procedure itself was technically successful in 127 cases (87%). Reasons for failure were the inability to completely extract thrombus from the AA in six, failed angioplasty due to long segment vein stenosis or sclerosis in seven or vein rupture in two, and central vein occlusion in one. Three failures occurred for unknown causes \u2264 3 days of successful thrombectomy. No single factor analyzed (age, sex, race, diabetes status, access type or location) was associated with technical failure. The estimated primary and secondary functional patency rates were 27% \u00b1 5% and 61% \u00b1 6% at 12 months.\nThe manual clot extraction technique described in this report effectively removed acute and chronic thrombus from failed AAs. Its use, combined with an intervention to treat the underlying cause for AA failure, significantly extended access durability.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this review was to assess the place of retroperitoneal (RP) aortic surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in the endovascular era and evaluate the evidence supporting it in preference to the more traditional transperitoneal approach. As endovascular graft technology improves, open aortic surgery is declining. AAAs unsuitable for endovascular aneurysm repair are, by definition, anatomically challenging. The RP approach is especially suited to anatomic challenges such as those posed by contemporary open AAA because it facilitates access to the suprarenal aorta. There is evidence that the RP approach reduces postoperative morbidity and length of stay compared with transperitoneal approaches. The evidence available indicates that the RP approach should be the first considered for any AAA unsuitable for endovascular aneurysm repair; however, the technique is more difficult to learn and less commonly practiced than the transperitoneal approach. Combined with a decrease in training hours in the United Kingdom, there is a real threat that the RP technique will only be performed by an ever-decreasing number of enthusiasts.",

    "abstract": "Muscular injuries contribute to perioperative and long-term morbidity after vascular surgery in humans. We determined whether local and remote ischemic postconditioning might similarly decrease muscle mitochondrial dysfunction through reduced oxidative stress.\nEighteen male Black-6 mice were divided in three groups: (1) sham mice had no ischemia (sham), (2) ischemia-reperfusion (IR) mice underwent 2-hour tourniquet-induced ischemia on both hind limbs, followed by 2-hour reperfusion, and (3) postconditioning (PoC) mice underwent four bouts of 30-second reperfusion and 30-second ischemia at the onset of reperfusion on the right limb; thus, the right limb underwent local PoC and left limb underwent remote PoC (rPoC). Maximal oxidative capacity (V(max)) of the gastrocnemius muscle mitochondrial respiratory chain was measured. Oxidative stress was evaluated by dihydroethidium staining. Expressions of genes involved in antioxidant defense (superoxide dismutase [SOD1], SOD2, glutathione peroxidase [GPx]), apoptosis (Bax, BclII), and inflammation (interleukin-6) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Muscle inflammation was determined using immunohistochemistry.\nIR reduced V(max) (8.5 \u00b1 2.2 vs 10.2 \u00b1 1.8 \u03bcmol O(2)/min/g dry weight; P = .034), and increased dihydroethidium staining (134.8%; P = .039).

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the anatomic distribution and associated mortality of combat-related vascular injuries comparing them to a contemporary civilian standard.\nThe Joint Trauma Theater Registry (JTTR) was queried to identify patients with major compressible arterial injury (CAI) and noncompressible arterial injury (NCAI) sites, and their outcomes, among casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2003 to 2006. The National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) was then queried over the same time frame to identify civilian trauma patients with similar arterial injuries. Propensity score-based matching was used to create matched patient cohorts from both populations for analysis.\nRegistry queries identified 380 patients from the JTTR and 7020 patients from the NTDB who met inclusion criteria. Propensity score matching for age, elevated Injury Severity Score (ISS; >15), and hypotension on arrival (systolic blood pressure [SBP] <90) resulted in 167 matched patients from each registry. The predominating mechanism of injury among matched JTTR patients was explosive events (73.1%), whereas penetrating injury was more common in the NTDB group (61.7%). In the matched cohorts, the incidence of NCAI did not differ (22.2% JTTR vs 26.6% NTDB; P = .372), but the NTDB patients had a higher incidence of CAI (73.7% vs 59.3%; P = .005). The JTTR cohort was also found to have a higher incidence of associated venous injury (57.5% vs 23.4%; P < .001). Overall, the matched JTTR cohort had a lower mortality than NTDB counterparts (4.2% vs 12.6%; P = .006), a finding that was also noted among patients with NCAI (10.8% vs 36.4%; P = .008). There was no difference in mortality between matched JTTR and NTDB patients with CAI overall (2.0% vs 4.1%; P = .465), or among those presenting with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <8 (28.6% vs 40.0%; P = 1.00) or shock (SBP <90; 10.5% vs 7.7%; P = 1.00). The JTTR mortality rate among patients with CAI was, however, lower among patients with ISS >15 compared with civilian matched counterparts (10.7% vs 42.4%; P = .006).\nMortality of injured service personnel who reach a medical treatment facility after major arterial injury compares favorably to a matched civilian standard. Acceptable mortality rates within the military cohort are related to key aspects of an organized Joint Trauma System, including prehospital tactical combat casualty care, rapid medical evacuation to forward surgical capability, and implementation of clinical practice guidelines. Aspects of this comprehensive combat casualty care strategy may translate and be of value to management of arterial injury in the civilian sector.",

We compared the evidence for both open and laparoscopic treatment of patients with MALS.\nWe reviewed the English-language literature between 1963 and 2012. Presenting symptoms, clinical improvement, operative details, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were noted.\nA total of 400 patients underwent surgical (open and laparoscopic) treatment for MALS. Three hundred thirty-nine patients reported immediate postoperative symptom relief (85%). Late recurrence of symptoms was reported in 19 patients in the open group (6.8%) and seven patients in the laparoscopic group (5.7%). Eleven out of 121 patients (9.1%) in the laparoscopic group required open conversion secondary to bleeding.\nThe available evidence demonstrates that both laparoscopic and open ligament release, celiac ganglionectomy, and celiac artery revascularization may provide sustained symptom relief in the majority of patients diagnosed with MALS. The role of arterial revascularization following ligament release remains unclear. The rate of open conversion with the laparoscopic approach is high, but no perioperative deaths have been reported.",

    "abstract": "To validate micro-lightguide spectrophotometry (O2C) in patients with lower limb ischemia and to compare results with those obtained from toe blood pressure.\nWe prospectively examined 59 patients, 24 of whom complained of claudication, 31 had critical ischemia, and four were asymptomatic. Diabetes was present in 19 (32%) patients. Saturation (SO(2)) and flow measured with O2C were determined with the limb in the horizontal position followed by a 55-cm elevation. Toe pressures were determined in the horizontal position only. In addition, 13 patients were examined before and, on average, 3 days after revascularization.\nMedian SO(2) was 62% (25%-75% percentile: 37%-75%) with the limb in the horizontal position and 16% (3%-41%) with the limb elevated. Comparing the individual toe pressures with SO(2) values measured in the horizontal position and elevated position revealed a significant correlation (r(s) = 0.40; P < .01 and r(s) = 0.56; P < .01, respectively). A low SO(2) (ie, <40% in the horizontal position and <20% in the elevated position) was highly predictive of a toe pressure of 40 mm Hg or less. In the horizontal position, the positive predictive value was 100%, whereas the negative predictive value was 47%. The similar figures in the elevated position were a positive predictive value of 97% and a negative predictive value of 68%. Postoperatively, SO(2) increased significantly from 27% (P25%-75%: 11%-75%) to 79% (68%-87%) in the horizontal position (P = .008) and from 14% (P25%-75%: 2%-39%) to 55% (30%-73%) in the elevated position (P = .011), respectively. Looking at the individual 13 cases in which revascularization was performed, three patients had a partial reconstruction (ie, superficial femoral artery occlusion distal to a central reconstruction or reconstruction to a popliteal blind segment). These patients had significantly lower postoperative SO(2) as well as toe pressure compared with the 10 patients with unobstructed flow to the foot.\nO2C was easy to use, fast, and painless. The most useful finding was the high predictive value of a low saturation and the rise in O2C values after successful revascularization.",

Computed tomography angiography at 30 days showed a patent bypass, successful aneurysm exclusion, and improvement of the tracheal compression. The patient is currently asymptomatic at 12 months following the procedure.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a frequent form of atherothrombotic disease, whose natural history is to enlarge and rupture. Indicators other than AAA diameter would be useful for preventive surgery decision-making, including positron-emission tomography (PET) methods permitting visualization of aortic wall leukocyte activation relevant to prognostic AAA evaluation. In this study, we compare three PET tracers of activated leukocytes, 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG), 18F-fluoro-methyl-choline (FCH), and 18F-DPA714 (a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) for in vivo PET quantification of aortic wall inflammation in rat experimental AAAs, in correlation with histopathological studies of lesions.\nAAAs were induced by orthotopic implantation of decellularized guinea pig abdominal aorta in 46 Lewis rats. FDG-PET (n = 20), FCH-PET (n = 8), or both (n = 12) were performed 2 weeks to 4 months after the graft, 1 hour after tracer injection (30 MBq). Six rats (one of which had FDG-PET) underwent 18F-DPA714-PET. Rats were sacrificed after imaging; AAAs and normal thoracic aortas were cut into axial sections for quantitative autoradiography and histologic studies, including ED1 (macrophages) and CD8 T lymphocyte immunostaining. Ex vivo staining of AAAs and thoracic aortas with 18F-DPA714 and unlabeled competitors was performed.\nAAAs developed in 35 out of 46 cases. FCH uptake in AAAs was lower than that of FDG in all cases on imaging, with lower AAA-to-background maximal standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) ratios (1.78 \u00b1 0.40 vs 2.71 \u00b1 0.54; P < .01 for SUV(max) ratios), and lower AAA-to-normal aorta activity ratios on autoradiography (3.52 \u00b1 1.26 vs 8.55 \u00b1 4.23; P < .005). FDG AAA-to-background SUV(max) ratios correlated with the intensity of CD8 + ED1 staining (r = .76; P < .03). FCH AAA-to-background SUV(max) ratios correlated with the intensity of ED1 staining (r = .80; P < .03). 18F-DPA714 uptake was similar in AAAs and in normal aortas, both in vivo and ex vivo.\nIn rat experimental AAA, characterized by an important aortic wall leukocytes activity, FDG-PET showed higher sensitivity than FCH-PET and 18F-DPA714-PET to detect activated leukocytes. This enhances potential interest of this tracer for prognostic evaluation of AAA in patients.",

    "abstract": "Evidence for the best treatment strategy for patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) at different stages of renal insufficiency (RI) is rare. Therefore, we determined the benefit of revascularization vs medical therapy (MT) only in CLI patients with different levels of RI.\nThis intention-to-treat cohort study with follow-up at 2, 6, and 12 months was conducted in a consecutive series of 351 patients with CLI. Revascularization by surgical (78 patients) or endovascular techniques (191 patients) was performed in 269 patients. MT as first-line therapy was administered in 82 patients. Patients were grouped according to glomerular filtration rate (GFR), estimated with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation, into absent/mild RI (estimated GFR [eGFR], \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), moderate RI (eGFR, 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), and severe RI (eGFR, <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or dialysis). Primary outcome measures were overall and amputation-free survival. Cox regression models adjusted for baseline characteristics after Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were performed.\nThe mean age differed significantly between groups (P < .001), and patients with absent/mild RI were more often men (P < .001) or smokers (P < .001) and less often hypertensive (P < .001). Risk factor adjustment showed that revascularized CLI patients with absent/mild RI had a longer amputation-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26-0.82; P = .008), higher limb salvage (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.17-0.91; P < .029), and better clinical success than MT patients (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.17-0.65; P = .001). The moderate RI group benefited from revascularization in overall survival (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26-0.99; P = .049), amputation-free survival (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29-0.90; P = .020), and clinical success (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22-0.80; P = .008). A beneficial effect on overall survival was found even in patients with severe RI when revascularized (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12-0.91; P = .032 vs MT).\nPatients with CLI may benefit from revascularization compared with MT alone at all levels of renal impairment. Thus, revascularization should not be withheld in CLI patients at any level of RI.",

    "abstract": "True and false lumen changes and patient outcomes following thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for patients with stable type B dissection have been described by the The Investigation of Stent Grafts in Aortic Dissection (INSTEAD) trial. However, these changes have not been described in TEVAR patients treated for complications of chronic dissection.\nA single-institution study was conducted of 73 prospectively evaluated patients treated for complications of chronic type B dissection from 2002 to 2010. Spiral computed tomography reconstructions using M2S (Medical Media Systems, West Lebanon, NH) were analyzed for sequential changes in aortic volume and diameter during patient follow-up. Changes in aortic volume and diameter were tabulated as a percent change from preoperative values. Patient outcomes were determined by sequential evaluations postprocedure.\nTEVAR was successfully performed in 72 out of the 73 patients (99%). Indications for intervention were aortic enlargement (n = 62), failure of medical management (n = 7), and perforation (n = 4). The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 14%; events were due to retrograde dissection (n = 4), cardiac-related (n = 4), and rupture (n = 2). Eleven out of the 72 patients (15%) required a secondary procedure for endoleak (n = 7) and persistent distal perfusion of the false lumen (n = 4). Mean percentage expansion of the thoracic true lumen was noted during the follow-up period: 38%, 46%, 71%, and 114% at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up, respectively. Concomitant regression of the thoracic false lumen of -65%, -68%, -84%, and -84% was observed at the same intervals, respectively. Patients with an initial extension of the thoracic dissection into the infrarenal aorta (n = 46) had an increase in mean percentage change of aortic diameter and volume to 21% and 17% at 1 year, respectively. By contrast, in the patient group without infrarenal dissection (n = 14), the infrarenal aortic diameter and volume remained relatively unchanged at 3% and -0.9%, respectively, at 1-year postintervention.\nTEVAR is a potential treatment option for patients experiencing complications of chronic type B dissection. During follow-up, there is a predictable expansion of the thoracic true lumen and regression of the thoracic false lumen. These findings correlate with those of the INSTEAD trial, which demonstrated false lumen regression and true lumen expansion in a cohort of patients with stable type B dissection. However, many patients with extension of thoracic dissection into the infrarenal aorta demonstrate continued aortic dilation and, on occasion, the need for secondary intervention for persistent distal perfusion. Further analysis is needed in this subgroup of patients so as to better determine potential predictors and the clinical significance of post-TEVAR infrarenal expansion. Moreover, further investigations may support a role for secondary endovascular intervention in remedying persistent infrarenal aortic expansion after TEVAR for chronic dissection.",

    "abstract": "The femoral vein is increasingly utilized as a conduit in major arterial and venous reconstruction. However, perioperative complications, especially venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with femoral vein harvest (FVH), are not well described. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors for the development of symptomatic VTE in patients who undergo FVH.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent FVH over a 5-year period at a single institution. Patient clinical characteristics, indications for surgery, postoperative venous duplex scans, and computerized tomography scans of the chest were gathered and reviewed from an electronic medical record query. Statistical analysis was performed to determine which factors correlate with development of perioperative complications after FVH.\nThere were 57 patients (53% male; mean age, 62 years) who underwent 58 FVHs. Of the procedures, 53% were performed for arterial reconstruction and 47% for vascular reconstruction after cancer resection (85% portomesenteric reconstruction). Perioperative VTEs were diagnosed in 17 of 58 (29%) FVH procedures. Sixteen ipsilateral deep vein thromboses (DVTs) occurred distal to the FVH site and five (9%) occurred proximal to the FVH site. The incidence of VTE was significantly greater in patients with malignancy (52% vs 10%; P = .001), and 88% of all VTEs in this series were diagnosed in patients with cancer. All DVTs proximal to the FVH site and all DVTs in the contralateral extremity occurred in patients with malignancy. Pulmonary embolism occurred in two patients. No patients developed compartment syndrome or limb loss. Eight patients (14%) required FVH site wound debridement.\nVTE after FVH occurs more frequently in patients with malignancy. Aggressive and prolonged thromboprophylaxis and routine venous ultrasound surveillance are warranted after FVH in patients with malignancy.",

Of the procedures, 53% were performed for arterial reconstruction and 47% for vascular reconstruction after cancer resection (85% portomesenteric reconstruction). Perioperative VTEs were diagnosed in 17 of 58 (29%) FVH procedures. Sixteen ipsilateral deep vein thromboses (DVTs) occurred distal to the FVH site and five (9%) occurred proximal to the FVH site. The incidence of VTE was significantly greater in patients with malignancy (52% vs 10%; P = .001), and 88% of all VTEs in this series were diagnosed in patients with cancer. All DVTs proximal to the FVH site and all DVTs in the contralateral extremity occurred in patients with malignancy. Pulmonary embolism occurred in two patients. No patients developed compartment syndrome or limb loss. Eight patients (14%) required FVH site wound debridement.",

    "abstract": "Current Canadian and international guidelines suggest patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or nondisabling stroke and ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis of 50% to 99% should be offered carotid endarterectomy (CEA) \u2264 2 weeks of the incident TIA or stroke. The objective of the study was to identify whether these goals are being met and the factors that most influence wait times.\nPatients who underwent CEA at the Ottawa Hospital for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis from 2008 to 2010 were identified. Time intervals based on the dates of initial symptoms, referral to and visit with a vascular surgeon, the decision to operate, and the date of surgery were recorded for each patient. The influence of various factors on wait times was explored, including age, sex, type of index event, referring physician, distance from the surgical center, degree of stenosis, and surgeon assigned.\nOf the 117 patients who underwent CEA, 92 (78.6%) were symptomatic. The median time from onset of symptoms to surgery for all patients was 79 days (interquartile range [IQR], 34-161). The shortest wait times were observed in stroke patients (49 [IQR, 27-81] days) and inpatient referrals (66 [IQR, 25-103] days). Only 7 of the 92 symptomatic patients (8%) received care within the recommended 2 weeks. The median surgical wait time for all patients was 14 days (IQR, 8-25 days). In the multivariable analysis, significant predictors of longer wait times included retinal TIA (P = .003), outpatient referrals (P = .004), and distance from the center (P = .008). Patients who presented to the emergency department had the shortest delays in seeing a vascular surgeon and subsequently undergoing CEA (P < .0001). There was no difference between surgeons for wait times to be seen in the clinic; however, there were significant differences among surgeons once the decision was made to proceed with CEA.\nOur wait times for CEA currently do not fall within the recommended 2-week guideline nor does it appear feasible within the current system. Important factors contributing to delays include outpatient referrals, living farther from the hospital, and presenting with a retinal TIA (amaurosis fugax). Our findings also suggest better scheduling practices once a decision is made to operate can modestly improve overall and surgical wait times for CEA.",

    "abstract": "The impact of geographic isolation on abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) care in the United States is unknown. It has been postulated but not proven that rural patients have less access to endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), vascular surgeons, and high-volume treatment centers than their urban counterparts, resulting in inferior AAA care. The purpose of this study was to compare the national experience for treatment of intact AAA for patients living in rural areas or towns with those living in urban areas.\nPatients who underwent intact AAA repair in 2005 to 2006 were identified from a standard 5% random sample of all Medicare beneficiaries. Data on patient demographics, comorbidities, type of repair, and specialty of operating surgeon were collected. Hospitals were stratified into quintiles by yearly AAA volume. Primary outcomes included 30-day mortality and rehospitalization.\nA total of 2616 patients had repair for intact AAA (40% open, 60% EVAR). Patients from rural and urban areas were equally likely to receive EVAR (rural 60% vs urban 61%; P = .99) and be treated by a vascular surgeon (rural 48% vs urban 50%; P = .82). Most rural patients (86%) received care in urban centers. Primary outcomes occurred in 11.6% of rural patients (1.3% 30-day mortality; 10.3% rehospitalization) vs 16.0% of urban patients (3% 30-day mortality, 13% rehospitalization; P = .04). In multivariate analyses, rural residence was independently associated with treatment at high-volume centers (odds ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-2.01; P < .0001) and decreased death or rehospitalization (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.97; P = .03).\nDespite geographic isolation, patients in rural areas needing treatment for intact AAAs have equivalent access to EVAR and vascular surgeons, increased referral to high-volume hospitals, and improved outcomes after repair. This suggests that urban patients may be disadvantaged even with nearby access to high-quality centers. This study supports the need for criteria that define centers of excellence to extend the benefit of regionalization to all patients.",

    "abstract": "Suprarenal endograft fixation is routinely used in the endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR) to enhance proximal endograft attachment but can be associated with an adverse outcome in renal function. This prospective study assessed the effect of suprarenal fixation on serum creatinine concentration and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated by the Modified Diet in Renal Disease equation, 12 months after elective EVAR.\nPatients undergoing elective EVAR were divided into suprarenal vs infrarenal fixation groups matched for age, sex, smoking, and aneurysm diameter. Serum creatinine and eGFR were measured at baseline, 6, and 12 months.\nIncluded were 92 patients (two women) with a mean age of 71 \u00b1 7 years, with 46 in each group. No device-related complications were noted. Serum creatinine did not differ significantly between groups at 6 (P = .24) or 12 (P = .08) months but significantly increased in the suprarenal group at 12 months (1.08 \u00b1 0.36 to 1.16 \u00b1 0.36 mg/dL; P < .001) vs baseline. The eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m(2)) did not differ significantly at baseline between the suprarenal (85 \u00b1 27) and infrarenal (80 \u00b1 28; P = .33) groups or at 6 months (88 \u00b1 29 vs 77 \u00b1 24, respectively; P = .07). At 12 months, the suprarenal group had a lower eGFR (73 \u00b1 23) than the infrarenal group (84 \u00b1 26; P = .027). The eGFR at 12 months showed a significant decrease in the suprarenal (80 \u00b1 28 to 73 \u00b1 23; P < .001) but not in the infrarenal group (85 \u00b1 27 to 84 \u00b1 26; P = .48). The drop in eGFR differed significantly at 12 months in the infrarenal vs the suprarenal (0.82 vs -6.94; P < .001) group. No patient progressed to end-stage renal disease or disclosed a drop in eGFR > 30%.\nIn contrast to previous studies, this study suggests that suprarenal endograft fixation in elective EVAR is associated with a drop in eGFR at 12 months.",

    "abstract": "Perioperative infection of an aortic graft is one of the most devastating complications of vascular surgery, with a mortality rate of 10% to 30%. The rate of amputation of the lower limbs is generally >25%, depending on the graft material, the location of the graft and infection, and the bacterial virulence. In vitro studies suggest that an antibiotic-impregnated graft may help prevent perioperative graft infection. In a pilot animal study, we tested a locally developed technique of bonding Dacron aortic grafts with three antimicrobial agents to evaluate the ensuing synergistic preventive effect on direct perioperative bacterial contamination.\nWe surgically implanted a 6-mm vascular knitted Dacron graft in the infrarenal abdominal aorta of six Sinclair miniature pigs. Two pigs received unbonded, uninoculated grafts; two received unbonded, inoculated grafts; and two received inoculated grafts that were bonded with chlorhexidine, rifampin, and minocycline. Before implantation, the two bonded grafts and the two unbonded grafts were immersed for 15 minutes in a 2-mL bacterial solution containing 1 to 2 \u00d7 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213). Two weeks after graft implantation, the pigs were euthanized, and the grafts were surgically excised for clinical, microbiologic, and histopathologic study.\nThe two bonded grafts treated with S aureus showed no bacterial growth upon explant, whereas the two unbonded grafts treated with S aureus had high bacterial counts (6.25 \u00d7 10(6) and 1.38 \u00d7 10(7) CFU/graft). The two control grafts (unbonded and untreated) showed bacterial growth (1.8 \u00d7 10(3) and 7.27 \u00d7 10(3) CFU/graft) that presumably reflected direct, accidental perioperative bacterial contamination; S cohnii ssp urealyticus and S chromogenes, but not S aureus, were isolated. The histopathologic and clinical data confirmed the microbiologic findings. Only pigs that received unbonded grafts showed histopathologic evidence of a perigraft abscess.\nOur results suggest that bonding aortic grafts with this triple antimicrobial combination is a promising method of reducing graft infection resulting from direct postoperative bacterial contamination for at least 2 weeks. Further studies are needed to explore the ability of this novel graft to combat one of the most feared complications in vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed outcomes of revascularization strategies in young patients with premature arterial disease.\nLower extremity revascularization outcomes from 2000 to 2008 were retrospectively compared among consecutive patients with comparable indications and procedures: age <50 years (group A) at the time of revascularization, 51 to 60 years (group B), and >60 years (control group C). Patency, limb salvage, and survival by limb or patient level were assessed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses.\nA total of 409 limbs in 298 patients were treated: 44% for claudication and 56% for critical limb ischemia (CLI). Group A patients were more likely to be smokers and have a hypercoagulable state but less likely to have diabetes and renal failure. Treatment indications were comparable among groups, and procedures were equally distributed between open surgical and endovascular interventions. Two perioperative deaths occurred in group C (2%). Mean follow-up was 29 months, and 16% of claudicant patients in group A progressed to CLI (B, 3%; C, 2%; P < .001). Overall, 2-year primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency were significantly lower in group A (50.5%, 65.2%, 68.2%; P = .045) vs B (65.7%, 81.4%, 86.8%; P = .01) and C (57.9%, 78.9%, 83.9%; P < .001). Claudicant patients in group A had an unexpectedly low 2-year freedom from major amputation after intervention of only 90%. Results were more comparable across groups for CLI. The 2-year freedom from reintervention was similar (A, 81.0%; B, 78.9%; C, 83.5%), irrespective of the indication for intervention (P = .60). Younger patients had a significantly higher 3-year survival (A, 89.5%; B, 85.3%) compared with patients aged >60 years (C, 71.4%; P = .005). The 2-year freedom from major amputation rate was significantly lower in claudicant patients in group A vs C undergoing endovascular revascularization (P = .002), but not in patients treated with open revascularization (P = .40). Predictors of loss of primary patency included age <50 years (P = .003), endovascular revascularization (P = .005), and progression from claudication to CLI (P < .001). Age <50 years was also an independent predictor of limb loss vs age >60 years (P = .05).\nEndovascular options are commonly being used in young patients, especially those with claudication, but patency rates and outcomes remain very poor.",

    "abstract": "A noninvasive method of visualization of the anterior spinal artery such as ultrasound that can be utilized in emergent or intraoperative settings can reduce the risk of spinal cord ischemia.\nWe assessed the feasibility of imaging and characterizing blood flow in the anterior spinal artery using ultrasound with concurrent validation using a cadaveric model.\nWe developed a protocol for ultrasonographic assessment of anterior spinal artery based on anatomic, morphologic, and physiologic characteristics of anterior spinal artery and determined the feasibility in 24 healthy research participants using high frequency probe (3-9 MHz) through the left lateral paramedian approach in the area between T8 and T12. We ascertained the detection rate, depth of insonation, and flow parameters, including peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity, and resistivity indexes for both segmental arteries and anterior spinal artery within the field of insonation. We validated the anatomical landmarks using simultaneous spinal angiography and simulated anterior spinal artery flow in a cadaveric set-up.\nWe detected flow in all segmental arteries at different levels of our field of insonation with mean depth (\u00b1 standard deviation) of insonation at 3.9 \u00b1 0.7 cm identified by characteristic high resistance flow pattern. Anterior spinal artery was detected in 15 (62.5%) research participants at mean depth (\u00b1 standard deviation) of 6.4 \u00b1 1.2 cm identified by characteristic low resistance bidirectional flow. Age, gender, and body mass index were not correlated with either the detection rate or depth of insonation for anterior spinal artery. Simultaneous spinal angiography and simulated anterior spinal artery flow in a cadaveric set-up confirmed the validity of the anatomic landmarks by demonstrating concordance with results obtained from volunteer research participants.\nThe current study describes a technique for noninvasive imaging of spinal vasculature using ultrasound which may enhance our diagnostic capabilities in emergent and intraoperative settings.",

    "abstract": "Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) occur most commonly in elderly individuals, who are often suboptimal candidates for open repair because of significant comorbidities. The availability of a hybrid option, including open visceral debranching with endovascular aneurysm exclusion, may have advantages in these patients who are at high-risk for conventional repair. This report details the evolution of our technique and results with complete visceral debranching and endovascular aneurysm exclusion for TAAA repair in high-risk patients.\nBetween March 2005 and June 2011, 47 patients (51% women) underwent extra-anatomic debranching of all visceral vessels, followed by aneurysm exclusion by endovascular means at a single institution. A median of four visceral vessels were bypassed. The debranching procedure was initially performed through a partial right medial visceral rotation approach, leaving the left kidney posterior in the first 22 patients, and in the last 25 by a direct anterior approach to the visceral vessels. The debranching and endovascular portions of the procedure were performed in a single operation in the initial 33 patients and as a staged procedure during a single hospital stay in the most recent 14.\nMedian patient age was 71.0 \u00b1 9.8 years. All had significant comorbidity and were considered suboptimal candidates for conventional repair: 55% had undergone previous aortic surgery, 40% were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 4, and baseline serum creatinine was 1.5 \u00b1 1.3 mg/dL. The 30-day/in-hospital rates of death, stroke, and permanent paraparesis/plegia were 8.5%, 0%, and 4.3%, respectively, but 0% in the most recent 14 patients undergoing staged repair. These patients had significantly shorter combined operative times (314 vs 373 minutes), decreased intraoperative red blood cell transfusions (350 vs 1400 mL), and were more likely to be extubated in the operating room (50% vs 12%) compared with patients undergoing simultaneous repair. Over a median follow-up of 19.3 \u00b1 18.5 months, visceral graft patency was 97%; all occluded limbs were to renal vessels and clinically silent. There have been no type I or III endoleaks or reinterventions. Kaplan-Meier overall survival is 70.7% at 2 years and 57.9% at 5 years.\nHybrid TAAA repair through complete visceral debranching and endovascular aneurysm exclusion is a good option for elderly high-risk patients less suited to conventional repair in centers with the requisite surgical expertise with visceral revascularization. A staged approach to debranching and endovascular aneurysm exclusion during a single hospitalization appears to yield optimal results.",

Primary end points included PT2 resolution (secondary interventional success) and survival, and were evaluated using multiple logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses, respectively.\nFifty-one patients underwent a total of 68 secondary interventions for PT2 with expanding aneurysm sacs with a median postsecondary interventional follow-up of 13.7 months. Secondary interventions included 20 inferior mesenteric artery coil embolizations, 17 Onyx glue embolizations, 11 aneurysm sac coil embolizations, 10 non-Onyx glue embolizations, 7 lumbar artery coil embolizations, 2 open lumbar ligations, and 1 graft explant. The overall secondary interventional success rate was 43% (29 of 68). Onyx glue embolization was associated with a greater success rate when used as the initial secondary intervention (odds ratio, 59.61; 95% confidence interval, 4.78-742.73; P < .001). There was no difference in success between the different techniques when multiple secondary interventions were required. Five-year survival was 72% \u00b1 0.08% and was unrelated to any of the secondary interventional techniques.\nSecondary intervention for PT2 is associated with success in less than half of all cases.

Secondary interventions included 20 inferior mesenteric artery coil embolizations, 17 Onyx glue embolizations, 11 aneurysm sac coil embolizations, 10 non-Onyx glue embolizations, 7 lumbar artery coil embolizations, 2 open lumbar ligations, and 1 graft explant. The overall secondary interventional success rate was 43% (29 of 68). Onyx glue embolization was associated with a greater success rate when used as the initial secondary intervention (odds ratio, 59.61; 95% confidence interval, 4.78-742.73; P < .001). There was no difference in success between the different techniques when multiple secondary interventions were required. Five-year survival was 72% \u00b1 0.08% and was unrelated to any of the secondary interventional techniques.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) is being increasingly performed despite lack of good evidence for its superiority. Other reported studies suffer from patient selection and publication bias with limited follow-up. This study is a single-center propensity score comparing early and midterm outcomes between open surgical repair (OSR) and endovascular repair of rAAA (REVAR).\nA retrospective review from January 2001 to November 2010 identified 312 patients who underwent rAAA repairs. Thirty-one patients with antecedent AAA repair and three with incomplete records were excluded, leaving 37 REVARs and 241 OSRs. Propensity score-based matching for sex, age, preoperative hemodynamic status, surgeon's annual AAA volume, and preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed in a 1:3 ratio to compare outcomes. Thirty-seven REVARs were matched with 111 OSRs. Late survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods.\nOperative time and blood replacement were higher with OSR. Overall complication rates were similar (54% REVAR vs 66% OSR; P = .23), except for higher incidences of tracheostomies (21% vs 3%; P = .015), myocardial infarction (38% vs 18%; P = .036), and acute tubular necrosis (47% vs 21%; P = .009) with OSR. Operative mortality rates were similar (22% REVAR vs 32% OSR), with an odds ratio of 0.63 for REVAR (95% confidence interval = [0.24, 1.48]; P = .40). No differences in the incidences for secondary interventions for aneurysm- or graft-related complications were noted (22% REVAR vs 22% OSR; P = .99). Kaplan-Meier estimates of 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were also similar (50%, 50%, 42% REVAR vs 54%, 52%, 47% OSR; P = .66).\nREVAR for rAAA does not seem to conclusively confer either acute or late survival advantages. Routine use of REVAR should be deferred until prospective, randomized trial data become available.",

    "abstract": "Although carotid artery stenosis and coronary artery disease often coexist, many debate which patients are best served by combined concurrent revascularization (carotid endarterectomy [CEA]/coronary artery bypass graft [CABG]). We studied the use of CEA/CABG in New England and compared indications and outcomes, including stratification by risk, symptoms, and performing center.\nUsing data from the Vascular Study Group of New England from 2003 to 2009, we studied all patients who underwent combined CEA/CABG across six centers in New England. Our main outcome measure was in-hospital stroke or death. We compared outcomes between all patients undergoing combined CEA/CABG to a baseline CEA risk group comprised of patients undergoing isolated CEA at non-CEA/CABG centers. Further, we compared in-hospital stroke and death rates between high and low neurologic risk patients, defining high neurologic risk patients as those who had at least one of the following clinical or anatomic features: (1) symptomatic carotid disease, (2) bilateral carotid stenosis >70%, (3) ipsilateral stenosis >70% and contralateral occlusion, or (4) ipsilateral or bilateral occlusion.\nOverall, compared to patients undergoing isolated CEA at non-CEA/CABG centers (n = 1563), patients undergoing CEA/CABG (n = 109) were more likely to have diabetes (44% vs 29%; P = .001), creatinine >1.8 mg/dL (11% vs 5%; P = .007), and congestive heart failure (23% vs 10%; P < .001). Patients undergoing CEA/CABG were also more likely to take preoperative beta-blockers (94% vs 75%; P < .001) and less likely to take preoperative clopidogrel (7% vs 25%; P < .001). Patients undergoing CEA/CABG had higher rates of contralateral carotid occlusion (13% vs 5%; P = .001) and were more likely to undergo an urgent/emergent procedure (30% vs 15%; P < .001). The risk of complications was higher in CEA/CABG compared to isolated CEA, including increased risk of stroke (5.5% vs 1.2%; P < .001), death (5.5% vs 0.3%; P < .001), and return to the operating room for any reason (7.6% vs 1.2%; P < .001). Of 109 patients undergoing CEA/CABG, 61 (56%) were low neurologic risk and 48 (44%) were high neurologic risk but showed no demonstrable difference in stroke (4.9% vs 6.3%; P = .76), death, (4.9 vs 6.3%; P = .76), or return to the operating room (10.2% vs 4.3%; P = .25).\nAlthough practice patterns in the use of CEA/CABG vary across our region, the risk of complications with CEA/CABG remains significantly higher than in isolated CEA. Future work to improve patient selection in CEA/CABG is needed to improve perioperative results with combined coronary and carotid revascularization.",

    "abstract": "Medial arterial calcification (MAC) is common in diabetes, has a characteristic appearance on X-ray imaging, and has been linked with peripheral arterial stiffness and cardiovascular disease. However, few studies have measured X-ray MAC. It has been suggested that an ankle-brachial index (ABI) >1.30 or an ankle-brachial difference (ABD) >75 mm Hg may identify X-ray MAC, but test characteristics are unknown. We hypothesized that an ABI >1.30 and ABD >75 mm Hg would have high specificity but low sensitivity for MAC on X-ray imaging.\nThis was a cross-sectional study of 185 community-living individuals with type 1 diabetes. The ABI and the ABD were assessed. The outcome was linear \"tram-track\" calcifications in the lower limbs characteristic of MAC.\nMean age was 32 \u00b1 6 years, and mean diabetes duration was 23 \u00b1 7 years. X-ray MAC was noted in 97 individuals (57%), 15 (8%) had ABI >1.30, and 14 (8%) had ABD >75 mm Hg. As assessed by the ABI, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for MAC was modest (0.65) and was slightly higher for the ABD (0.75). An ABI >1.30 had high specificity (99%) and positive predictive value (93%) but poor sensitivity (14%) and an overall accuracy of 55% for MAC. An ABD >50 mm Hg remained highly specific (98%) but had higher sensitivity (30%) and overall accuracy (62%).\nIndividuals with type 1 diabetes and an ABI >1.30 or ABD >50 mm Hg are very likely to have MAC on X-ray imaging, yet many with MAC will not have an ABI or ABD above these thresholds. Given the high specificity, evaluating high ABI or ABD may be useful to understand correlates of MAC but may underestimate MAC prevalence.",

    "abstract": "Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) is a critically time-sensitive condition with outcomes dependent on rapid diagnosis and definitive treatment. Emergency department (ED) death reflects the hemodynamic stability of the patient upon arrival and the ability to mobilize resources before hemodynamic stability is lost. The goals of this study were to determine the incidence and predictors of ED death for patients presenting to EDs with rAAAs.\nData for patients presenting with International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes for rAAA from 2006 to 2008 were extracted from discharge data using the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The NEDS is the largest stratified weighted sample of US hospital-based ED visits with links to inpatient files. We compared those transferred to those admitted and treated. Sample weights were applied to produce nationally representative estimates. Patient and hospital factors associated with transfer were identified using multivariate logistic regression. These factors were then analyzed for a relationship with ED deaths.\nA total of 18,363 patients were evaluated for rAAAs. Of these, 7% (1201) died in the ED, 6% (1160) were admitted and died without a procedure, 42% (7731) were admitted and died after repair, and 41% (7479) were admitted, treated, and survived. Transfers accounted for 4% (793) of all ED visits for rAAAs. ED death was more likely for patients seen in nonmetropolitan hospitals (12.7%) vs metropolitan nonteaching (7.0%) or metropolitan teaching hospitals (4.5%; P < .0001). Compared with other regions, the West had a higher ED mortality rate (9.6% vs 5.1%-6.9%; P = .0038). On multivariate analysis, ED death was associated with hospital groups exhibiting both high and low transfer rates.\nED death remains a significant cause for mortality for rAAAs and varies by hospital type, rural/urban location, and geographic region. Both delays in ED arrival and delays in providing definitive care may contribute to increased ED death rates, suggesting that improved regional systems of care may improve survival after rAAA.",

Compared with other regions, the West had a higher ED mortality rate (9.6% vs 5.1%-6.9%; P = .0038). On multivariate analysis, ED death was associated with hospital groups exhibiting both high and low transfer rates.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the outcome of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) as primary therapy for exposed prosthetic vascular grafts in the groin (Szilagyi III).\nThe study included all consecutive patients with Szilagyi III groin infections and exposed prosthetic graft material from 2009 to 2011. After initial wound debridement, VAC was applied using a two-layer combination, consisting of polyvinyl alcohol and polyurethane sponges. Continuous negative pressure was set on a maximum of 50 mm Hg. All patients received complementary antibiotic therapy. The primary end point was defined as complete wound closure. Secondary end points comprised bleeding complications, amputation, and death.\nThe study evaluated 15 patients with 17 Szilagyi III groin infections. Mean total length of VAC therapy was 43 days (range, 14-76 days). Mean time until complete healing was 51 days (range, 24-82 days). Mean length of VAC therapy in the hospital was 21 days (range, 5-61 days). Eleven patients received continued VAC treatment at home for a mean length of 22 days (range, 5-69 days). Complete healing was achieved in 14 groins (82%). Three failures due to persisting infection, persisting necrosis, and a pseudomonas infection were noted. No bleeding complications, amputations, or late reinfections occurred. Median follow-up was 380 days (range, 56-939 days). Despite therapy failure, all 17 grafts were preserved.\nVAC therapy on an exposed prosthetic vascular graft in the groin is safe and feasible when applying a combination of polyvinyl alcohol and polyurethane foam dressing and 50 mm Hg of continuous negative pressure, resulting in midterm graft preservation.",

    "abstract": "Patients with advanced peripheral artery disease (PAD) have a high prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and shortened life expectancy. However, CV risk factors poorly predict midterm (<5 years) mortality in this population. This study tested the hypothesis that baseline biochemical parameters would add clinically meaningful predictive information in patients undergoing lower extremity bypass operations.\nThis was a prospective cohort study of patients with clinically advanced PAD undergoing lower extremity bypass surgery. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the main outcome of all-cause mortality. A clinical model was constructed with known CV risk factors, and the incremental value of the addition of clinical chemistry, lipid assessment, and a panel of 11 inflammatory parameters was investigated using the C statistic, the integrated discrimination improvement index, and Akaike information criterion.\nThe study monitored 225 patients for a median of 893 days (interquartile range, 539-1315 days). In this study, 50 patients (22.22%) died during the follow-up period. By life-table analysis (expressed as percent surviving \u00b1 standard error), survival at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, was 90.5% \u00b1 1.9%, 83.4% \u00b1 2.5%, 77.5% \u00b1 3.1%, 71.0% \u00b1 3.8%, and 65.3% \u00b1 6.5%. Compared with survivors, decedents were older, diabetic, had extant coronary artery disease, and were more likely to present with critical limb ischemia as their indication for bypass surgery (P < .05). After adjustment for the above, clinical chemistry and inflammatory parameters significant (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]) for all-cause mortality were albumin (0.43 [0.26-0.71]; P = .001), estimated glomerular filtration rate (0.98 [0.97-0.99]; P = .023), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP; 3.21 [1.21-8.55]; P = .019), and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (1.74 [1.04-2.91]; P = .034). Of the inflammatory molecules investigated, hsCRP proved most robust and representative of the integrated inflammatory response. Albumin, eGFR, and hsCRP improved the C statistic and integrated discrimination improvement index beyond that of the clinical model and produced a final C statistic of 0.82.\nA risk prediction model including traditional risk factors and parameters of inflammation, renal function, and nutrition had excellent discriminatory ability in predicting all-cause mortality in patients with clinically advanced PAD undergoing bypass surgery.",

    "abstract": "Wound morbidity commonly accompanies transposition of the femoral vein when used for hemodialysis access, mainly because of the length of the skin incision. A short incision may reduce wound complications but may compromise the arteriovenous (AV) function because of the shorter length of femoral vein available for puncture. This report presents our experience with a modification of the original technique, in which a smaller skin incision and fistula elevation were used.\nThe clinical course of 25 AV fistulas in the thigh using the femoral vein was retrospectively analyzed. The original technique to create femoral AV access was used in 12 patients and the modified technique in 13. The procedures were performed between 2005 and 2007, and patients were monitored until January 31, 2011.\nThree fistulas failed in each group. Five patients in the original group had wound complications. No wound complications occurred in the modified group. The fistula was first used at an average of 10.45 weeks and 6.14 weeks, respectively. Patency was similar in both groups.\nIt is possible to obtain a functional AV fistula in the thigh using the femoral vessels and limiting the extent of the incision. Long-term patency is reasonable, despite the use of a short femoral segment for puncture.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging and echo color Doppler (ECD) scan techniques do not accurately assess the cerebral venous return. This generated considerable scientific controversy linked with the diagnosis of a vascular syndrome known as chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) characterized by restricted venous outflow from the brain. The purpose of this study was to assess the cerebral venous return in relation to the change in position by means of a novel cervical plethysmography method.\nThis was a single-center, cross-sectional, blinded case-control study conducted at the Vascular Diseases Center, University of Ferrara, Italy. The study involved 40 healthy controls (HCs; 18 women and 22 men) with a mean age of 41.5 \u00b1 14.4 years, and 44 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS; 25 women and 19 men) with a mean age of 41.0 \u00b1 12.1 years. All participants were previously scanned using ECD sonography, and further subset in HC (CCSVI negative at ECD) and CCSVI groups. Subjects blindly underwent cervical plethysmography, tipping them from the upright (90\u00b0) to supine position (0\u00b0) in a chair. Once the blood volume stabilized, they were returned to the upright position, allowing blood to drain from the neck. We measured venous volume (VV), filling time (FT), filling gradient (FG) required to achieve 90% of VV, residual volume (RV), emptying time (ET), and emptying gradient (EG) required to achieve 90% of emptying volume (EV) where EV = VV - RV, also analyzing the considered parameters by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and principal component mathematical analysis.\nThe rate at which venous blood discharged in the vertical position (EG) was significantly faster in the controls (2.73 mL/second \u00b1 1.63) compared with the patients with CCSVI (1.73 mL/second \u00b1 0.94; P = .001). In addition, respectively, in controls and in patients with CCSVI, the following parameters were highly significantly different: FT 5.81 \u00b1 1.99 seconds vs 4.45 \u00b1 2.16 seconds (P = .003); FG 0.92 \u00b1 0.45 mL/second vs 1.50 \u00b1 0.85 mL/second (P < .001); RV 0.54 \u00b1 1.31 mL vs 1.37 \u00b1 1.34 mL (P = .005); ET 1.84 \u00b1 0.54 seconds vs 2.66 \u00b1 0.95 seconds (P < .001). Mathematical analysis demonstrated a higher variability of the dynamic process of cerebral venous return in CCSVI. Finally, ROC analysis demonstrated a good sensitivity of the proposed test with a percent concordant 83.8, discordant 16.0, tied 0.2 (C = 0.839).\nCerebral venous return characteristics of the patients with CCSVI were markedly different from those of the controls. In addition, our results suggest that cervical plethysmography has great potential as an inexpensive screening device and as a postoperative monitoring tool.",

Morbidity includes cranial nerve dysfunction, stroke, and the majority severe blood loss. Embolization of the feeding branches of the external carotid artery can be performed a few days prior to surgery with the intention to decrease blood loss during operation, facilitate surgical resection, and reduce operating time and morbidity. The special risk of embolization is migration into the intracranial circulation. Poloxamer 407, a reverse-thermal polymer, is a nontoxic compound that is a viscous liquid at room temperatures but instantly changes to a firm water-soluble gel when warmed to body temperature. It dissolves spontaneously or can be dissolved at will by cooling. We describe an intraoperative technique for complete devascularization of carotid body tumor by using an intraarterial temporary occlusion technique with a poloxamer 407.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the impact of diabetes in the management of patients with small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).\nThree-hundred sixty patients with small AAA (4.1-5.4 cm), enrolled in a randomized trial comparing early endovascular repair versus surveillance and delayed repair (after achievement of >5.5 cm or growth>1 cm/yr), were analyzed with standard survival methods to assess the relation between diabetes and risk of all-cause mortality, complications, and aneurysm growth (on computed tomography as per trial protocol) at 36 months. Baseline covariates were selected with partial likelihood stepwise method to investigate factors (demographic, morphologic, medications) associated with risk of aneurysm growth during surveillance.\nPrevalence of diabetes was 13.6%. The hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality at 36 months was higher in diabetic compared with nondiabetic patients: (HR, 7.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55-35.13; P=.012). Baseline aneurysm diameter was comparable between diabetic and nondiabetic patients enrolled in the surveillance arm and was related to subsequent aneurysm growth in covariance analyses adjusted for diabetes (49.3 mm for nondiabetic; 50.2 mm for diabetic). Cox analyses found diabetes as the strongest independent negative predictor of 63% lower probability of aneurysm growth>5 mm during surveillance (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15-0.92; P=.003). Kaplan-Meier cumulative probability of aneurysm growth>5 mm at 36 months was 40.8% in diabetics versus 85.1% in nondiabetics (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.17-0.61).\nProgression of small AAA seems to be more than 60% lower in patients with diabetes. This may help to identify high-risk subgroups at higher likelihood of AAA enlargement, such as nondiabetics, for surveillance protocols in patients with small AAA.",

    "abstract": "In patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), the postimplantation syndrome (PIS), comprising fever and inflammation, occurs frequently. The cause of PIS is unclear, but graft composition and acute thrombus formation may play a role. The objective of this study was to evaluate these possible causes of the inflammatory response after EVAR.\nOne hundred forty-nine patients undergoing elective EVAR were included. Implanted stent grafts differed mainly in the type of fabric used: either woven polyester (n=82) or expanded polytetrafluorethylene (ePTFE; n=67). Tympanic temperature and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed daily during hospitalization. PIS was defined as the composite of a body temperature of \u226538\u00b0C coinciding with CRP>10 mg/L. Besides graft composition, the size of the grafts and the volume of new-onset thrombus were calculated using dedicated software, and results were correlated to PIS.\nImplantation of grafts made of polyester was associated with higher postoperative temperature (P<.001), CRP levels (P<.001), and incidence of PIS (56.1% vs 17.9%; P<.001) compared to ePFTE. After multivariate analysis, woven polyester stent grafts were independently associated with an increased risk of PIS (hazard ratio, 5.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-19.4; P=.007). Demographics, amount of graft material implanted, or new-onset thrombus had no association with PIS.\nThe composition of stent grafts may play a material role in the incidence of postimplantation syndrome in patients undergoing EVAR. Implantation of stent grafts based on woven polyester was independently associated with a stronger inflammatory response.",

    "abstract": "Although aortoiliofemoral bypass grafting is the optimal revascularization method for patients with severe aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD), previous studies have documented poor patency rates in young adults. This study investigated whether young patients with AIOD have worse outcomes in patency, limb salvage, and long-term survival rates after reconstructive surgery than their older counterparts.\nPatients aged\u226450 years undergoing reconstructive surgery at our institution for AIOD between 1995 and 2010 were compared with a cohort of randomly selected patients aged\u226560 years (two for each of the young patients, matched for year of operation), analyzing demographics, risk factors, indications for surgery, operative details, and outcomes.\nAmong 927 consecutive patients undergoing primary surgery for AIOD, 78 (8.4%) aged\u226450 years (mean age, 48.4 years) and 156 older control patients (mean age, 71.2 years) were identified. The younger patients were mainly men (81%) and 59% had surgery for limb salvage and 41% for disabling claudication (P=.02). Compared with older patients, they were significantly more likely to be smokers (90% vs 72%; P=.002) and had previously needed significantly more inflow procedures (28% vs 16%; P=.03). Only one death occurred perioperatively (30-day) among the control patients, and no major amputations or graft infections occurred in either group. The need for subsequent infrainguinal reconstructions was greater in the younger patients (18% vs 7%; P=.01). The primary patency rates were inferior in the younger patients at 5 years (82% and 75%) and 10 years (95% and 90%; P=.01), whereas assisted secondary patency (89% and 82% vs 96% and 91%; P=.08), secondary patency (93% and 86% vs 98% and 92%; P=.19), limb salvage (88% and 83% vs 95% and 91%; P=.13), and survival rates (87% and 76% vs 91% and 84%; P=.32) were comparable in the two groups.\nThis study shows that despite a higher primary graft failure rate than that in older patients, aortoiliofemoral revascularization for complex AIOD is a safe procedure for younger patients with disabling claudication or limb-threatening ischemia, providing they are willing to follow a regular protocol to complete their postoperative surveillance and to undergo graft revision as necessary.",

    "abstract": "Baroreflex sensitivity is lower in patients with echogenic carotid plaques compared with patients with echolucent ones. The purpose of our study was to compare the baroreflex function after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) between patients with different plaque echogenicity.\nSpontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (sBRS), heart rate, and systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were calculated in 51 patients with a severe carotid stenosis (70%-99%) 24 hours before CEA, as well as 24 and 48 hours after CEA. Carotid plaque echogenicity was graded from 1 to 4 according to Gray-Weale classification, after duplex examination, and the patients were divided into two groups: the echolucent (grade 1 or 2) and the echogenic (grade 3 or 4).\nThe postoperative mean systolic arterial pressure values in all 51 patients at 24 and 48 hours (143.2 and 135.5 mm Hg, respectively) were found to be significantly increased compared with the preoperative value (132.5 mm Hg; x2=32, P<.001). Mean sBRS value, in all patients, was significantly reduced postoperatively to 2.1 ms mm Hg(-1), from the mean preoperative value, 3.7 ms mm Hg(-1), independently of plaque echogenicity. Twenty patients (39%) were included in the echolucent group and 31 (61%) in the echogenic. The two groups had significant differences in two parameters: the rate of diabetes mellitus and the rate of symptomatic plaques. After adjusting the two groups for these differences, we found that the preoperative difference in sBRS between the two groups (F[1,51]=11, P<.003) was eliminated 24 and 48 hours after CEA (F[1,51]=.007, P<.9 and F[1,51]=.4, P<.5 for 24 and 48 hours, respectively).\nBefore the removal of carotid atheroma, baroreflex sensitivity, which is a well established cardiovascular risk factor, seems to be affected by carotid plaque echogenicity. However, CEA has as a result a similar baroreflex response in all patients, regardless of plaque echogenicity, implying no association of plaque morphology and postoperative baroreflex sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "A 73-year-old man developed type I and III endoleaks from a fractured right renal stent with downward migration of a fenestrated endograft, 6 years after endovascular repair of a juxtarenal aneurysm. Endovascular treatment attempts were unsuccessful. He underwent aortic debranching and antegrade visceral artery revascularization via a left thoracolaparotomy incision and an extraperitoneal approach to the visceral aorta. An antegrade aortic stent covered the endoleak, with technical and clinical success at 9 months. Failure of complex endografts presents particular problems, potentially not amenable to totally endovascular repair. Continued surveillance is mandated as late, asymptomatic sac expansion can occur.",

    "abstract": "Chronic inflammation has been associated with endothelial dysfunction and altered coagulation status. However, at the present time, the data regarding the risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is still scanty and conflicted. This study aimed to explore the frequency and association of DVT with RA using a population-based dataset.\nThis was a case-control study conducted in Taiwan. A total of 5193 patients with DVT were identified from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID2000) database. In total, 20,772 controls matched with cases in terms of gender, age, and year of index date were randomly selected. We used conditional logistic regression to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for having been previously diagnosed with RA between cases and controls.\nOf the total 25,965 sampled subjects, 235 (0.9%) had been previously diagnosed with RA. Seventy-seven of these previous diagnoses were found among cases (1.5%) and 158 among controls (0.8%). Conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that cases were more likely to have had prior RA than controls (OR, 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46-2.53; P<.001). After adjusting for hospitalization history, pregnancy, fracture, surgery, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia, and renal disease, there was still a significant association between DVT and prior RA (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.42-2.58; P<.001).\nWe found RA to be significantly associated with DVT. Appropriate management should be taken to minimize the risk of DVT in patients with RA. Further study is needed to confirm our findings.",

    "abstract": "While randomized trials have shown improved operative mortality with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) but similar long-term mortality rates, enthusiasm for EVAR persists, and rates of EVAR use continue to increase. Currently, knowledge of utilization rates of EVAR in Canada is limited.\nPatients who underwent nonruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and ruptured AAA (RAAA) repair, by either open surgical repair (OSR) or EVAR, in Canada were identified from hospital discharge abstract data. Trends in rates for OSR and EVAR were calculated by province and by year, and standardized per 100,000 persons over 65 years of age (per capita).\nBetween April 2004 and March 2009, 15,960 AAA procedures were performed in Canada, either by OSR (n=12,204) or EVAR (n=3756). The proportion of all elective AAA procedures by EVAR increased from 11.5% in 2005 to 35.5% in 2009, the highest current proportion of EVAR utilization in British Columbia (45.0%) and the lowest in Manitoba (15.8%). After standardization, the national rate of total procedures was steady, but the rate of RAAAs declined over the entire study period. Alberta consistently had the highest per capita rates of EVAR use (38.9), whereas Prince Edward Island had the lowest (8.4). Provincial variations in EVAR use did not correlate with differences in comorbidities. Compared with Canadian averages, Atlantic Provinces performed the most AAA procedures per capita (137.5 vs 93.4), had the highest rate of RAAAs per capita (29.7 vs 22.2), and had the lowest proportional rates of EVAR use.\nUse of EVAR in Canada for AAAs has increased in the past 5 years, without affecting overall AAA procedure volumes. Large discrepancies in EVAR use exist across Canada. The Atlantic Provinces had the highest rates of RAAAs despite having the highest rates for total AAA procedures, suggesting a population with higher susceptibility for AAAs. This region may also have the largest potential for future increased use of EVAR.",

    "abstract": "The number of endovascular procedures performed is increasing exponentially as technology improves. A serious complication of endovascular therapy is loss of a foreign body in the vasculature. We reviewed our experience and evaluated the cause, management, and outcomes of intravascular foreign body (IVFB) misplacement.\nWe completed a retrospective review of patients who underwent endovascular retrieval of IVFBs between 2005 and 2010. Patients were identified by current procedural terminology code or by our hospital's risk management team. Patients undergoing routine endovascular retrieval of temporary vena cava filters were excluded.\nTwenty-seven IVFBs were identified in 26 patients. Twenty patients were asymptomatic (76.9%). Six patients were symptomatic (22.2%) with either pain (n = 4) or abnormal physical findings (n = 2). There were 13 (48.1%) catheter fragments, six (22.2%) guidewires, five (18.5%) inferior vena cava (IVC) filter (embolisms), two (7.4%) stents, and one (3.7%) sheath fragment. There were five (15.6%) embolizations of an IVFB into the right heart, three (9.4%) into a pulmonary artery, eight (25%) into the vena cava, eight (25%) into peripheral veins, five (15.6%) into peripheral arteries, one (3.1%) into a coronary artery, one (3.1%) into a hepatic vein, and one (3.1%) into adjacent soft tissue. The mechanism of endovascular loss was device fracture in 16 (59.3%) cases, loss of control in six cases (22.2%), migration in four (14.8%) cases, and incorrect device deployment in one case (3.7%). The probable cause of foreign body loss was technical error in eight (29.6%) cases. In three cases, IVFB retrieval was not attempted. The misplacement and retrieval were completed during the same procedure in 13 (48%) cases. Twenty-four endovascular retrievals were performed. Fifteen (62.5%) procedures used a snare to remove the IVFB and two (8.2%) used balloon catheters. Three IVFBs could not be removed and two cases were converted to open procedures. Technical success was achieved in 19/24 cases (79.2%). There were no immediate complications related to the retrieval of the IVFB; however, there was a single late complication of pulmonary embolism after failed endovascular retrieval (1/24, 4.2%). Thirty-day survival was 100%.\nIntravascular foreign bodies are a serious complication of endovascular therapy that can be minimized with proper device selection and deployment. When an intravascular foreign body is identified, endovascular retrieval should be attempted due to its high success rate and minimal morbidity.",

    "abstract": "High-mobility-group box protein 1 (HMGB1), as a late mediator of inflammation, plays a key role in inflammatory responses by inducing and extending the production of proinflammatory cytokines. The effect of HGMB1 in the inflammatory disease thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) is unknown. We aimed to investigate the role of HMGB1 in sodium laurate-induced TAO in rats.\nMale Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n=8 each) for treatment: normal, sham-operated, TAO model, and low-dose (15 mg/kg) or high-dose (30 mg/kg) recombinant A box (rA box) infection (administered intraperitoneally once daily for 15 days). The TAO model was induced by sodium laurate and graded by gross appearance on day 15 after femoral artery injection. Histologic changes were measured by histopathology in rat femoral arteries. Plasma levels of HMGB1, thromboxane B2, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1-\u03b1, and blood cell counts and blood coagulation levels were measured. Expression of HMGB1, receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 was assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, Western blot analysis, and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.\nThe typical signs and symptoms of TAO were observed on day 15 after sodium laurate injection. The expression of HMGB1, RAGE, interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 was markedly increased in rat femoral arteries. Plasma levels of HMGB1 and thromboxane B2 were elevated, but the level of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1-\u03b1 was decreased. Blood was in a hypercoagulable state, and prothrombin, thrombin, and activated partial thromboplastin times were all significantly shortened, whereas fibrinogen level was increased in TAO rats compared with sham-operated rats. These effects were terminated by the HMGB1 antagonist rA box.\nHMGB1 is involved in the inflammatory state in a model of TAO induced by sodium laurate in rats, probably via its receptor RAGE. As the antagonist of HMGB1, rA box can attenuate the development of TAO, which may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of TAO.",

It can be presumed that revascularization of the artery directly supplying the ischemic angiosome may be superior to indirect revascularization of the concerned ischemic angiosome.\nThis was a prospective study of 64 patients with continuous single crural vessel runoff to the foot presenting with critical limb ischemia from January 2007 to September 2008. Direct revascularization (DR) of the ischemic angiosome was performed in 61% (n=39), indirect revascularization (IR) in 39% (n=25). Open surgery was performed in 60.9% and endovascular interventions in 39.1%. All patients were evaluated for the status of the wound and limb salvage at 1, 3, and 6 months. The study end points were major amputation or death, limb salvage, and wound epithelialization at 6 months.\nIn the study, 81.2% of patients had forefoot ischemia, 17.2% had ischemic heel, whereas 1.6% had midfoot nonhealing ischemic ulceration. The runoff involved the anterior tibial artery in 42.2% (27/64), posterior tibial artery in 34.4% (22/64), and the peroneal artery in 23.4% (15/64). All patients were followed at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively for ulcer healing, major amputation, or death. At the end of 6 months, nine patients expired, and six were lost to follow-up. Of 49 patients who completed 6 months, nine underwent major amputation, and 40 had limb salvage. Ulcer healing at 1, 3, and 6 months for DR vs IR were 7.9% vs 5%, 57.6% vs 12.5%, and 96.4% vs 83.3%, respectively. This difference in the rates of ulcer healing between the DR and IR groups was statistically significant (P=.021). The limb salvage in the DR group (84%) and IR group (75%) was not statistically significant (P=.06). The mortality was 10.2% for DR and 20% for IR at 6 months.\nTo attain better ulcer healing rates combined with higher limb salvage, direct revascularization of the ischemic angiosome should be considered whenever possible. Revascularization should not be denied to patients with indirect perfusion of the ischemic angiosome as acceptable rates of limb salvage are obtained.",

    "abstract": "Placement of arterial endoprostheses across the inguinal ligament is generally thought to be contraindicated for fear of device kinking, fracture, or occlusion and possible obliteration of the deep femoral artery (DFA). We present a series of selected patients who underwent insertion of polytetrafluoroethylene-covered nitinol stents (Viabahn stent grafts. W. L. Gore and Associates Inc, Flagstaff, Ariz) crossing the middle common femoral artery (CFA) on an emergency basis or who were considered high risk for open surgery.\nWe treated 16 patients with 17 lesions adjacent to or within the CFA with stent grafts that originated in the common iliac (two) or external iliac (15) artery and terminated in the distal CFA (12), DFA (three), or superficial femoral (two) artery. Stent grafts were placed on an elective (10) or emergency (seven) basis for arterial occlusive disease (10), bleeding (six), and aneurysmal disease (one). Comorbidities favoring endovascular treatment were high medical risk (10) previous scarring (four), morbid obesity (two), and dense arterial calcification precluding open surgical repair (one).\nThe DFA was deliberately sacrificed in one of the 17 cases. No patient suffered major complications after the procedure. All grafts remained patent based on duplex ultrasound imaging during follow-up (mean, 12.3 months; range, 1-58 months). Two patients required an additional endovascular intervention to treat inflow or outflow stenoses during follow-up, yielding a 2-year primary patency rate of 93.8% and assisted primary patency rate of 100%.\nThese results suggest that selective placement of Viabahn stent grafts across the inguinal ligament to treat arterial occlusive disease or bleeding may prove to be safe, effective, and associated with acceptable patency rates. This strategy helps avoid complicated open arterial surgery in high-risk patients with associated multiple medical risk factors or hostile scarred groins.",

All patients who were admitted for elective open AAA repair were recruited. Preoperative BNP levels were performed and batch analyzed at the end of the study. Postoperative screening for cardiac events (nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiac death) was performed at 2, 5, and 30 days. Follow-up for all-cause mortality was sustained to a minimum of 3 years, where possible.\nA total of 106 of 111 patients were recruited. Median BNP concentrations were higher in the 16 patients (15%) with immediate postoperative cardiac events (P = .001) and the five with cardiac death (P = .043). Area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUC) curve analysis indicated BNP concentrations of 99.5 pg/mL best predicted cardiac events (AUC, 0.927), and 448 pg/mL predicted cardiac death (AUC, 0.963). BNP also predicted all-cause mortality in the short-term (P = .028), intermediate-term (P < .001), and long-term (P < .001) postoperative periods.\nPreoperative serum BNP concentration predicted postoperative cardiac events, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality in patients undergoing elective open AAA repair on short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term follow-up on an individual basis with greater accuracy than currently available risk prediction tools.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular stent grafts are utilized in the rescue of failing arteriovenous (AV) access. Reports claim the superiority of stent grafts and recommend these as a first-line treatment. We have observed a rise in the number of complications related to stent grafts in our patients. The following study was undertaken to assess the severity of these complications and their effect on access site maintenance.\nWe reviewed all patients who had endovascular stent grafts placed for treatment of failing dialysis access over the last 44 months. A series of 38 consecutively placed stent grafts was reviewed for stent migration, fracture, erosion, hemorrhage, and rupture at the site of the stent grafts. Hospital charts were reviewed to assess for indications, hemodynamic stability, transfusion requirement, and outcome.\nOf 38 stent grafts placed, nine were for pseudoaneurysm (PS), 20 for stenosis (ST), and nine for a combination (PS/ST). The average length of follow-up was 218.6 days. Primary patency was 49%, with an assisted primary patency of 76%. Eleven patients (28.9%) presented with complications related to migration, fracture, erosion, or rupture. Six were in the PS, three in the PS/ST, and two in the ST treatment groups. In all cases, migration or fracture of the stent graft led to recurrent pseudoaneurysm formation or erosion. Rupture occurred after a herald bleed in four cases. Once complication occurred, 10 of the 11 access sites had to be abandoned.\nSignificant life-threatening complication can arise when fracture and migration of the stent grafts used for treating AV access occur. Herald bleed with a previously placed stent graft may be a harbinger of future rupture. Complications appear less likely when stent grafts are used to treat stenosis; however, when complications occur, access site salvage is rare. Surgical revision in the case of pseudoaneurysm should be considered for access preservation.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the predictive value of clinical and exercise test variables in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nA customized symptom-limited ramp treadmill protocol was used to assess 725 PAD patients referred for exercise testing at the Palo Alto Veterans Hospital between 1997 and 2011. Detailed clinical and exercise test data were collected at baseline, and patients were followed up for a mean of 11.3 \u00b1 6.3 years.\nDuring follow-up, there were 364 deaths. Baseline exercise capacity was 7.0 \u00b1 2.6 metabolic equivalents (METs) among survivors and 5.5 \u00b1 2.4 METs in those who died (P < .001). Although several physiologic parameters differed between survivors and nonsurvivors, age-adjusted Cox regression revealed that exercise capacity was the strongest independent predictor of death. Each additional MET achieved was associated with age-adjusted 18% and 20% reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively (P < .001 for both). This variable surpassed all classical risk factors (including smoking and history of congestive heart failure) and all measured exercise test responses (including symptoms and electrocardiograph abnormalities).\nAmong PAD patients, reduced exercise capacity is the most powerful harbinger of long-term mortality. This factor has predictive power beyond traditional risk factors and confirms the critical importance of fitness in this cohort.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated outcomes of remote endarterectomy (RE) vs endovascular (ENDO) interventions on TransAtlantic Inter-Societal Consensus (TASC)-II D femoropopliteal lesions and identified factors predictive of restenosis.\nFrom October 2004 to December 2008, 95 patients with TASC-II D lesions were randomized 1:1 to receive RE of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) with end point stenting (51 patients) or ENDO, consisting of subintimal angioplasty with stenting (44 patients). The groups were balanced for age, sex, atherosclerotic risk factors, and comorbidities. Categoric data were analyzed with \u03c72 tests, and time to event provided two-sided P values with a level of significance at .05 and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Survival curves for primary patency were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis for diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and critical ischemia was performed according to the Cox proportional hazards model.\nThe mean follow-up was 52.5 months (range, 35-75 months). Five RE patients and four ENDO patients were lost to follow-up (censored). Primary patency was 76.5% (39 of 51) in RE and 56.8% (25 of 44) in ENDO (hazard ratio [HR], 2.6; 95% CI, 0.99-4.2; P=.05) at 24 months and was 62.7% (32 of 46) in RE and 47.7% (21 of 40) in ENDO (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 0.94-3.78; P=.07) at 36 months. Assisted primary patency was 70.6% (36 of 51) in RE and 52.3% (23 of 44) in ENDO (HR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.20-5.02; P=.01). Secondary patency overlapped the primary comparison data at 12 and 24 months; at 36 months, there was a slight but significative advantage for RE (HR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.05-4.86; P=.03). Univariate analysis demonstrated that hypercholesterolemia and critical limb ischemia (CLI) were significantly related to patency failure, whereas diabetes was significant only in ENDO. These factors (hypercholesterolemia and CLI) were independent predictors of patency on Cox multivariate analysis.\nRE is a safe, effective, and durable procedure for TASC-II D lesions. Our data demonstrate a significantly higher primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency of RE vs ENDO procedures. Furthermore, overall secondary patency rates remain within the standard limits, although preoperative CLI and dyslipidemia continue to be associated with worse outcomes. Taken together, these data suggest that RE should be considered better than an endovascular procedure in SFA long-segment occlusion treatment.",

The aim of this study was to conduct a risk-adjusted retrospective concurrent cohort comparison of f-EVAR and open repair for such aneurysms.\nAll patients who underwent repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm that was unsuitable for a standard EVAR due to inadequate neck within one institution between January 2006 and December 2010 were identified. Case notes were retrieved for clinical data, Vascular Physiological and Operative Severity Score for enUmeration of Mortality and Morbidity (V-POSSUM) score, and aneurysm morphology. Computed tomography scans were reviewed to establish aneurysm morphology.\nA total of 107 patients were identified. The open surgery cohort included 54 patients (35 men) who were a median age of 72 years (interquartile range [IQR], 9.5; range, 60-86 years). The aortic cross-clamp was infrarenal in 20 patients, suprarenal or above in 21, and inter-renal in eight. Postoperatively, 63 major complications were noted in 30 patients, nine of whom required 16 reinterventions. Cumulative hospital stay of the cohort was 1170 days (median, 12; IQR, 13; range, 1-205 days) of which 234 days (median, 28; IQR, 36; range, 1-77 days) were in the intensive therapy unit (ITU). Perioperative mortality was 9.2% (n = 5), exactly as estimated by V-POSSUM. The f-EVAR cohort included 53 patients (47 men) who were a median age of 76 years (IQR, 11.50; range, 55-87 years). Two fenestrations and one scallop was the most frequent configuration (n = 31). Postoperatively, 37 major complications were noted in 18 patients, six requiring reintervention.

The Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg (BASIL) trial investigators developed a model to predict death, which has not been previously validated.\nData were collected in a prospectively maintained database on all patients who underwent angioplasty or arterial bypass for peripheral artery disease in a university hospital between January 2008 and June 2010. The main outcome measures were all-cause mortality and amputation-free survival at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the index intervention. The BASIL survival predictor, Finland National Vascular (FINNVASC) registry, and Edifoligide for the Prevention of Infrainguinal Vein Graft Failure (PREVENT) models were applied and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate their predictive power.\nData on 342 patients were collected. Patients with isolated iliac disease or claudication were excluded. The 6-, 12-, and 24-month all-cause mortality rates were 11.6%, 17.9%, and 26.8%, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (95% confidence interval) using the BASIL score to predict mortality at 6, 12, and 24 months was 0.700 (0.60-0.80; P<.001), 0.651 (0.56-0.74; P<.003), and 0.681 (0.59-0.74; P<.001), respectively. ROC curve analysis indicated that the performance of the BASIL score in this cohort was comparable to other validated predictive scores.\nThe BASIL survival prediction model can moderately predict short-term and medium-term mortality in patients with limb ischemia and may be a useful adjunct to decision making in everyday clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have investigated the development of new ischemic brain lesions on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) after carotid artery stenting (CAS). The rate of ischemic brain injury after CAS for asymptomatic stenosis has not been extensively studied but is presumed to be less likely than in symptomatic patients. This study assessed the occurrence of cerebral embolization after CAS for asymptomatic vs symptomatic carotid stenosis.\nDuring an 18-month period, 40 patients undergoing CAS under filter embolic protection were prospectively evaluated. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) during CAS and preprocedural and 24-hour postprocedural DW-MRI were used to assess cerebral embolization. Univariate and nonparametric analyses were used to compare differences in cerebral embolization after CAS in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.\nCAS was performed for 23 asymptomatic (58%) and 17 symptomatic (42%) carotid stenoses. The median microembolic counts detected by TCD were 285 (interquartile range [IQR], 182-376) for asymptomatic and 313 (IQR, 170-426) for symptomatic carotid stenosis (P=.6). DW-MRI was available for assessment in 20 asymptomatic and 14 symptomatic patients. New acute cerebral emboli detected with DW-MRI occurred in 10 asymptomatic (50%) and 7 symptomatic patients (50%) undergoing CAS (P=.9). The ipsilateral and total median number of DW-MRI lesions between groups were not statistically significantly different at, respectively, 1 (IQR, 0-2.5) and 1.5 (IQR, 0-3) for asymptomatic vs 0.5 (IQR, 0-2) and 0.5 (IQR, 0-3) for symptomatic carotid stenosis (P>.5). One asymptomatic patient sustained a minor stroke after CAS. No new neurologic events occurred in symptomatic patients. The 30-day stroke-death rate was 2.5% in this series.\nCerebral embolization, as detected by TCD and DW-MRI, occurs with a similar frequency after CAS for asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis. Because postprocedural ischemic brain injury occurs in approximately half of asymptomatic patients, the safety of CAS under filter embolic protection for asymptomatic carotid stenosis is uncertain and warrants further study.",

    "abstract": "Currently, no formal practice guidelines exist regarding the use of endografts to exclude hemodialysis access pseudoaneurysms and prolong access lifespan in dialysis patients. We evaluated the efficacy of percutaneous endograft placement for exclusion of hemodialysis access pseudoaneurysms.\nBetween July 2005 and October 2009, 32 patients were prospectively evaluated. Twenty-four patients were actively enrolled in the study based upon clinical and ultrasonographic evaluation of their hemodialysis accesses. Self-expanding covered endografts were placed percutaneously to exclude access pseudoaneurysms. Patients were evaluated at 2 and 6 months to assess for graft patency, access or outflow stenosis, endoleak, or stent graft migration.\nNo procedural complications resulted from these interventions. An average of 1.8 endografts was placed per patient, with patients requiring between 1 and 3 endografts to exclude pseudoaneurysms. Primary-assisted patency was 83% at completed 2-month follow-up and 54% at 6-month follow-up. At 12 months, primary-assisted patency was 50%. Eleven patients left the study before 6-month follow-up: five (21%) required explantation secondary to infection between 1 and 4 months; three (13%) were lost to follow-up; two (8%) died of unrelated causes; and 1 requested explantation citing pain from the \"stent poking the vein.\" Mean time to explantation secondary to infection was 2.4 months. Mean duration of patency was 17.6 months with a range from 0 to 76 months. Mean duration of patency for patients who completed 6-month follow-up was 28.7 months. The longest duration of patency is 6 years 4 months, after stent fracture and subsequent placement of a new stent at 6 years 2 months. One other incident of stent fracture occurred at 36 months. Dialysis patterns were not interrupted in either patient.\nThe long-term results demonstrate that endograft salvage of failing hemodialysis accesses is a viable and safe alternative to open surgical revision that excludes pseudoaneurysms while maintaining uninterrupted access patency. A larger sample size and longer follow-up are needed to support the study data.",

    "abstract": "Podiatrists play an important role in the multidisciplinary team in diabetic limb salvage. Podiatry is a specialty that is licensed in the diagnoses and treatment of pathologies of the foot and ankle. The treatment includes both conservative and surgical modalities. Understanding the biomechanics of the lower extremity is principally emphasized in the education and training of a podiatrist. This is particularly important in the context of the diabetic foot where biomechanical abnormalities often precede ulcer development. Preventive ulcer development strategies employed by a podiatrist include regular monitoring, routine care of calluses, and insert/shoe recommendations. Further, clinic-based ulcer care as well as surgery that include prophylactic and acute intervention can translate to the preservation of a functional limb. Finally, continuous podiatric management can prevent ulcer recurrence through offloading strategies and diabetic foot education.",

    "abstract": "General surgery residents graduate with an inconsistent knowledge of cardiovascular disease and an inadequate skill set for the practice of vascular surgery. Vascular educators have proposed to overcome these challenges by incorporating standardized milestones and simulation curricula into vascular education, but at present, nonclinical vascular education remains nonstandardized. The first step in this direction is to lay a foundation of knowledge and skill for trainees nationwide, and regionalized courses have begun to be offered to address this need. Through the Methodist DeBakey Institute for Cardiovascular Education, we have developed our own course, The Cardiovascular Fellows Bootcamp. The principles behind The Cardiovascular Fellows Bootcamp are teach early, teach the basics, teach broadly, and teach multiple cardiovascular disciplines, and over a 3-day weekend of didactic lectures and skill training, we aim to lay a foundation for cardiovascular training that prepares the trainees for their fellowship. In this article, we describe the way in which our course is run and the thought process behind our approach. We also address some of the practical concerns that make hosting a course of this magnitude feasible and our plans for improving and expanding in the future.",

    "abstract": "Exercise therapy is a common intervention for the management of intermittent claudication (IC). However, considerable uncertainty remains about the effect of different exercise components such as intensity, duration, or content of the exercise programs. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of supervised walking therapy (SWT) as treatment in patients with IC and to update and identify the most important exercise components resulting in an optimal training protocol for patients with IC.\nA systematic literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases was performed. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 1966 and February 2012 were included if they evaluated the effectiveness of SWT. Predefined exercise components were extracted, including treadmill use during training, claudication pain end point used during walking, length of the SWT program, and total training volume. A meta-analysis and meta-regression was performed to evaluate the weighted mean difference in maximum walking distance (MWD) and pain-free walking distance (PFWD) between SWT and noninterventional observation.\nTwenty-five RCTs (1054 patients) comparing SWT vs noninterventional observation showed a weighted mean difference of 180 meters (95% confidence interval, 130-230 meters) in MWD and 128 meters (95% confidence interval, 92-165 meters) in PFWD, both in favor of the SWT group. In multivariable meta-regression analysis, none of the predefined exercise components were independently associated with significant improvements in MWD or PFWD.\nSWT is effective in improving MWD and PFWD in patients with IC. However, pooled results from the RCTs did not identify any of the exercise components including intensity, duration, or content of the program as being independently associated with improvements in MWD or PFWD.",

    "abstract": "This study determined the effect of pulmonary disease on outcomes after endovascular abdominal (EVAR) and endovascular thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (eTAAA) repair.\nA prospective study of high-risk patients undergoing EVAR and eTAAA repair between 1998 and 2009 was used to contrast clinical and endovascular outcomes between patients with (group 1) and without (group 2) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD patients were classified in accordance with the severity of their pulmonary disease using the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria. Survival, morphologic changes, and complications were assessed using Cox models and life-table analyses. The cause and timing of deaths between the groups was compared.\nOf 905 patients analyzed, 289 (32%) had COPD (group 1) and the remaining patients (group 2) did not have COPD. EVAR was performed in 334 patients (37%), and fenestrated or branched devices were used in the remaining 571 (63%). Group 1 patients were younger (73.5 \u00b1 6.7 vs 75.6 \u00b1 8.2 years), had a better glomerular filtration rate (67.8 \u00b1 25.8 vs 61.0 \u00b1 23.3 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), had higher hematocrits (41.6 \u00b1 5.0 vs 40.5 \u00b1 4.6), and had more extensive aneurysms. Mean follow-up was 39.5 \u00b1 30.9 months. Early (3% vs 3%) and late (2% vs 1%) aneurysm-related deaths were similar between the two groups. Survival in group 1 depended on the severity of disease. Survival in patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease classification I and II was similar to group 2. Those with classifications III and IV demonstrated lower survival rates. Relevant pulmonary function test variables included a lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced expiratory flow in the middle 50%, which were associated with decreased survival. Surrogate endovascular outcome analyses demonstrated that group 1 patients had fewer endoleaks (20% vs 25%; P = .05) and more rapid sac shrinkage rate (1.66 mm/y difference; P < .001).\nThe perioperative risk of death between COPD patients and non-COPD patients is eliminated when endovascular techniques are used. Long-term survival in COPD patients is most strongly related to the severity of their disease, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced expiratory flow in the middle 50% are reasonable indicators of poor long-term outcomes. Morphologic changes after EVAR and eTAAA repair are more favorable in COPD patients, with a lower endoleak rate and faster sac shrinkage.",

    "abstract": "The care of patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and tissue loss is notoriously challenging and expensive. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of various management strategies to identify those that would optimize value to patients.\nA probabilistic Markov model was used to create a detailed simulation of patient-oriented outcomes, including clinical events, wound healing, functional outcomes, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) after various management strategies in a CLI patient cohort during a 10-year period. Direct and indirect cost estimates for these strategies were obtained using transition cost-accounting methodology. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), in 2009 U.S. dollars per QALYs, were calculated compared with the most conservative management strategy of local wound care with amputation as needed.\nWith an ICER of $47,735/QALY, an initial surgical bypass with subsequent endovascular revision(s) as needed was the most cost-effective alternative to local wound care alone. Endovascular-first management strategies achieved comparable clinical outcomes but at higher cost (ICERs \u2265$101,702/QALY); however, endovascular management did become cost-effective when the initial foot wound closure rate was >37% or when procedural costs were decreased by >42%. Primary amputation was dominated (less effectiveness and more costly than wound care alone).\nContemporary clinical effectiveness and cost estimates show an initial surgical bypass is the most cost-effective alternative to local wound care alone for CLI with tissue loss and can be supported even in a cost-averse health care environment.",

    "abstract": "A 66-year-old man with an abdominal aortic aneurysm previously repaired with an endovascular stent graft presented to our facility with worsening midabdominal and back pain. Previous postoperative surveillance computed tomography scans were unremarkable, showing excellent stent-wall apposition and a shrinking aneurysm sac; however, imaging done on his arrival identified a contained rupture at the level of the celiac artery containing a perforating suprarenal stent. We repaired this rupture with a surgeon-modified fenestrated stent graft. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of penetration of the native aorta by a suprarenal stent in the absence of infection or trauma.",

    "abstract": "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a quality measure recorded by initiatives such as the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). However, because surveillance-detected DVT rates may be higher than symptomatic DVT rates, we examined how differences in the method of DVT detection may affect the use of this quality measure.\nUsing the NSQIP database (2007-2009), we compared DVT rates of vascular (amputation, open aortic procedures, and lower extremity bypass) and nonvascular (prostatectomy, gastric bypass [GBP], and hip arthroplasty) operations. Using a predefined literature search strategy, we compared the incidence of DVT in NSQIP to the incidence of DVT reported in published literature, diagnosed by symptomatic status or by surveillance studies.\nWithin NSQIP, the overall incidence of postoperative DVT was 0.7%. This varied from 0.3% after GBP to 1.8% after open aortic surgery. Across all procedures except amputation, the incidence of DVT in NSQIP was similar to the incidence of DVT reported in our literature survey of \"symptomatic\" DVTs. The relative rate (RR) of literature-derived symptomatic DVTs to NSQIP ranged from 0.7 for aortic cases (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3-1.7) to 1.4 (95% CI, .7-3.1) for GBP. Overall, surveillance studies had 11.6 higher RR of DVT compared to NSQIP (95% CI, 10.5-13), ranging from 2.6 for GBP (95% CI, 1.4-5) to 14 .5 for hip arthroplasty (95% CI, 10.5-20).\nThe incidence of DVT reported in NSQIP is similar to the reported incidence of symptomatic DVT for many high-risk procedures but is much lower than rates of DVT reported in surveillance studies. Clear delineation of symptomatic vs surveillance detection of DVT would improve the usefulness of this measurement in quality improvement registries.",

    "abstract": "A current debate concerning suspected superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) focuses on the need of performing a compression ultrasound (CUS) exploration for confirming the diagnosis of SVT. This study was conducted to determine the clinical relevance and optimal CUS exploration in patients with symptomatic SVT.\nWe analyzed the characteristics of SVT and concomitant deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients included in the Prospective Observational Superficial Thrombophlebitis (POST) multicenter, observational prospective study. All patients underwent complete bilateral lower limb CUS, exploring both the superficial and deep venous systems.\nA total of 844 patients with clinical symptoms of SVT were recruited, of which 99 isolated SVTs (21.4%) had saphenofemoral/popliteal junction involvement, and 198 (23.5%) had a concomitant DVT, with 41.8% of them proximal DVTs. In 83 patients (41.9%), DVT and SVT were not contiguous. Five of 639 patients (1%) had an isolated contralateral DVT (ie, not bilateral). Age \u2265 75 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-3.4), inpatient status (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.4-8.7), a personal history of DVT or pulmonary embolism (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.8), and SVT on nonvaricose veins (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.1-5.0) were significantly and independently associated with an increased risk of concomitant DVT. Half of the patients exhibited none of these risk factors, and the prevalence of concomitant DVT dropped to 11%.\nIn patients with symptomatic SVT, a CUS exploration screening the whole venous system of the affected limb is useful because it provides information that has important consequences for the management of these patients.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of head and neck malignancy commonly involves radiotherapy, which is associated with the development of carotid artery stenosis. There is little evidence to guide clinicians on how to intervene in significant postradiotherapy carotid stenosis. This systematic review collated data pertaining to perioperative outcomes of carotid artery surgery and carotid stenting in postradiotherapy carotid stenosis to aid the clinical decision-making process.\nA systematic review of the literature, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009 guidelines, was performed. We screened 575 articles related to carotid artery surgery or stenting in postradiotherapy carotid stenosis, from which 21 studies were included for quantitative analysis. The primary outcome was stroke or death \u2264 30 days of the procedure. Secondary outcomes included cranial nerve injury, restenosis, stroke, and death at >30 days.\nNine publications recorded 211 surgical procedures in 179 patients. In symptomatic patients, the 30-day mortality rate was 2.6% and the stroke or death rate was 2.7%. In asymptomatic patients, the 30-day mortality rate was 0% and the stroke or death rate was 1.1%. Permanent cranial nerve palsy was experienced by 0.6% of patients. Twelve publications recorded 510 carotid artery stenting procedures in 482 patients. In symptomatic patients, the 30-day mortality rate was 5.1%, and the stroke or death rate was 5.1%. In asymptomatic patients, the 30-day mortality rate was 1.4%, and the stroke or death rate was 2.1%. There was no statistically significant difference in 30-day stroke or death rate between surgical revascularization and carotid artery stenting in all (odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-1.70; P = .43), symptomatic (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.14-1.98; P = .38), or asymptomatic patients (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.06-5.42; P = .99).\nThe published outcomes from high-volume centers demonstrate that surgical revascularization and stenting are both technically feasible in postradiotherapy carotid stenosis and have similar safety profiles to nonirradiated necks. Radiation should therefore not be considered a contraindication to surgical intervention.",

A new retracting device is described that vastly improves operative field visualization, particularly in the upper area where high lesions and limited cervical mobility can restrict or hamper technical maneuvers. Complex maneuvers such as mandibular subluxation or osteotomy may be obviated.",

    "abstract": "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) resolution instigates an inflammatory response, resulting in vessel wall damage and scarring. Urokinase-plasminogen activator (uPA) and its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), are integral components of the fibrinolytic system, essential for venous thrombosis (VT) resolution. This study determined the vein wall response when exposed to increased and decreased plasmin activity.\nA mouse inferior vena cava (IVC) ligation model in uPA -/- or PAI-1 -/- and their genetic wild types (B6/SvEv and C57/BL6, respectively) was used to create stasis thrombi, with tissue harvest at either 8 or 21 days. Tissue analysis included gene expression of vascular smooth muscle cells (alpha smooth muscle actin [\u03b1SMA], SM22) and endothelial marker (CD31), by real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 activity by zymography, and vein wall collagen by picro-Sirius red histologic analysis. A P < .05 was considered significant.\nThrombi were significantly larger in both 8-day and 21-day uPA -/- as compared with wild type (WT) and were significantly smaller in both 8-day and 21-day PAI-1 -/- as compared with WT. Correspondingly, 8-day plasmin levels were reduced in half in uPA -/- and increased three-fold in PAI-1 -/- when compared with respective WT thrombi (P < .05; n = 5-6). The endothelial marker CD31 was elevated two-fold in PAI-1 -/- mice at 8 days, but reduced 2.5-fold at 21 days in uPA -/- as compared with WT (P = .02; n = 5-6), suggesting less endothelial preservation. Vein wall vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) gene expression showed that 8-day and 21-day PAI-1 -/- mice had 2.3- and 3.8-fold more SM22 and 1.8- and 2.3-fold more \u03b1SMA expression than respective WT (P < .05; n = 5-7), as well as 1.8-fold increased \u03b1SMA (+) cells (P \u2264 .05; n = 3-5). No significant difference in MMP-2 or -9 activity was found in the PAI-1 -/- mice compared with WT, while 5.4-fold more MMP-9 was present in 21-day WT than 21-day uPA -/- (P = .03; n = 5). Lastly, collagen was \u223ctwo-fold greater at 8 days in PAI-1 -/- IVC as compared with WT (P = .03; n = 6) with no differences observed in uPA -/- mice.\nIn stasis DVT, plasmin activity is critical for thrombus resolution. Divergent vein wall responses occur with gain or loss of plasmin activity, and despite smaller VT, greater vein wall fibrosis was associated with lack of PAI-1.",

    "abstract": "High restenosis rates are a limitation of peripheral vascular interventions. Previous studies have shown that surgical implantation of a tissue-engineered endothelium onto the adventitia surface of injured vessels regulates vascular repair. In the present study, we developed a particulate formulation of tissue-engineered endothelium and a method to deliver the formulation perivascular to injured blood vessels using a percutaneous, minimally invasive technique.\nStainless steel stents were implanted in 18 balloon-injured femoral arteries of nine domestic swine, followed by ultrasound-guided percutaneous perivascular injection of gelatin particles containing cultured allogeneic porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAE). Controls received injections of empty particles (matrix) or no perivascular injection (sham) after stent deployment. Animals were sacrificed after 90 days.\nAngiographic analysis revealed a significantly greater lumen diameter in the stented segments of arteries treated with PAE/matrix (4.72 \u00b1 0.12 mm) compared with matrix (4.01 \u00b1 0.20 mm) or sham (4.03 \u00b1 0.16 mm) controls (P < .05). Similarly, histologic analysis revealed that PAE/matrix-treated arteries had the greatest lumen area (20.4 \u00b1 0.7 mm(2); P < .05) compared with controls (16.1 \u00b1 0.9 mm(2) and 17.1 \u00b1 1.0 mm(2) for sham and matrix controls, respectively) and the smallest intimal area (3.3 \u00b1 0.4 mm(2); P < .05) compared with controls (6.2 \u00b1 0.5 mm(2) and 4.4 \u00b1 0.5 mm(2) for sham and matrix controls, respectively). Overall, PAE-treated arteries had a 33% to 50% decrease in percent occlusion (P < .05) compared with controls. Histopathological analysis revealed fewer leukocytes present in the intima in the PAE/matrix group compared with control groups, suggesting that the biological effects were in part due to inhibition of the inflammatory phase of the vascular response to injury.\nMinimally invasive, perivascular delivery of PAE/matrix to stented arteries was performed safely using ultrasound-guided percutaneous injections and significantly decreased stenosis. Application at the time of or subsequent to peripheral interventions may decrease clinical restenosis rates.",

In these cases, contrast-enhanced computed tomography, sagittal reformed images, and angiography revealed celiac artery stenoses due to compression by the median arcuate ligament. Computed tomography also showed acute localized dissection in the distal celiac axis, suggesting that aneurysmal rupture had occurred immediately after development of the dissection.

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) scans are routinely used for graft surveillance in patients who have had endovascular repair (EVAR) of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is a growing concern for cancers associated with inadvertent use of CT scans. We report the estimated risk of radiation associated solid organ malignancy caused by routine surveillance CT after EVAR using the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR VII) model created by U.S. National Institute of Science and National Research Council.\nOur study estimated the excess relative risk (ERR) of a patient acquiring a solid organ malignancy secondary to radiation exposure from postoperative EVAR surveillance CT imaging. The radiation dose was calculated in sieverts (Sv). The ERR of solid organ malignancy, as given by the BEIR VII model, is = \u03b2(s) D exp {\u03b3e*} (a/60)(\u03b7), where \u03b2(s), \u03b3, and \u03b7 are data-derived parameters, e is age at exposure, and e* = (e-30)/10 for e < 30 and zero for e \u2265 30, a is attained age, and D is dose in sieverts. Dose-weighted ERRs were calculated to allow a comparison of malignancy risk when using a CT at all time points (model 1: 0, 1, 6, 12, and 18 months, 2, 3, and 4 years, and yearly thereafter) vs replacing the CT scan with two other models (model 2: CT once in 3 years) and (model 3: CT once in 5 years). The risk was stratified by age groups, sex, and use of two different radiation doses (15 or 31 mSv) per CT scan. Statistical analysis used the paired t test.\nThere were significant differences between the ERR of solid organ malignancy in those patients who would undergo surveillance CTs at all time points vs those whose surveillance consisted of alternative modalities at some time points (P < .0001). The cumulative ERR of cancer from radiation was higher in those exposed to contrast-enhanced CT scans, younger people, with highest in the group aged 50 to 55 years (ERR, 0.43), and lowest in patients aged \u2265 80 years (ERR, 0.10).\nPatients undergoing routine CT scans for postoperative surveillance after EVAR are at risk for acquiring new solid organ malignancy due to radiation exposure. The risk is higher in young patients, women, and those exposed to multiple contrast-enhanced CT scans. Our analysis questions the need for routine surveillance CT scans after EVAR in the absence of endoleaks or a change in aneurysm morphology, based on an increased malignancy risk.",

    "abstract": "Surgical treatment for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome does not always yield successful outcomes. The purpose of this study was to describe patients with unresolved, recurrent, and/or contralateral symptoms following first rib resection and scalenectomy (FRRS) and to determine therapies for improving their outcomes.\nData on 161 neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome patients (182 FRRS procedures) were prospectively collected from 2003 to 2011 and retrospectively reviewed for evidence of unresolved, recurrent, and/or contralateral neurogenic symptoms following FRRS. Demographic and clinical characteristics, interventions, and outcomes were compared between these patients and those with a successful result.\nTwenty-three patients (24 FRRS) had unresolved symptoms at a mean of 16.1 \u00b1 14.7 postoperative months. Compared with successes, these patients were older (mean age, 45 vs 38 years; P = .002) and active smokers (33% vs 13%; P = .031), with a longer duration of symptoms (90 vs 48 months; P = .005). They had higher rates of chronic pain syndromes (67% vs 14%; P < .001), neck and/or shoulder comorbidities (58% vs 22%; P < .001), preoperative opioid use (67% vs 31%; P = .001), and preoperative Botox injections (46% vs 20%; P = .009) with less relief (18% vs 64%; P = .014). Sixteen patients had recurrent symptoms at a mean of 12.1 \u00b1 9.7 postoperative months. These patients had more chronic pain syndromes (38%; P = .028) and neck and/or shoulder comorbidities (50%; P = .027), with recurrence secondary to scar tissue (69%; P < .001) and reinjury (31%; P = .002). Postoperative treatments for both groups included physical therapy and local injections, where six unresolved (26%) and 13 recurrent (81%) patients achieved freedom from opioids at the end of the follow-up period. Twenty-one patients had contralateral symptoms and underwent secondary FRRS at a mean of 15.0 months (range, 7-30 months) following primary FRRS. The first operation was successful in 90% of cases.\nPatients with unresolved symptoms are older, active smokers with more comorbid pain syndromes, neck and/or shoulder disease, and a longer symptom duration. These patients face a more difficult recovery, whereas patients with recurrent symptoms are well managed with physical therapy and Botox injections. Patients with contralateral symptoms at >1 year are effectively treated with secondary FRRS. Patients must be followed closely after FRRS to determine if additional interventions are necessary to ensure successful results.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous treatment of multilevel aortic disease is controversial due to the theoretic increase in morbidity. This study was conducted to define the outcomes in patients treated electively with simultaneous thoracic endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (TEVAR) and abdominal aortic endovascular endografting for synchronous aortic pathology.\nPatients treated with simultaneous TEVAR and endovascular aneurysm repair (T&E) at the University of Florida were identified from a prospectively maintained endovascular aortic registry and compared with those treated with TEVAR alone (TA). The study excluded patients with urgent or emergency indications, thoracoabdominal or mycotic aneurysm, and those requiring chimney stents, fenestrations, or visceral debranching procedures. Demographics, anatomic characteristics, operative details, and periprocedural morbidity were recorded. Mortality and reintervention were estimated using life-table analysis.\nFrom 2001 to 2011, 595 patients underwent TEVAR, of whom 457 had elective repair. Twenty-two (18 men, 82%) were identified who were treated electively with simultaneous T&E. Mean \u00b1 standard deviation age was 66 \u00b1 9 years, and median follow-up was 8.8 months (range, 1-34 months). Operative indications for the procedure included dissection-related pathology in 10 (45%) and various combinations of degenerative etiologies in 12 (55%). Compared with TA, T&E patients had significantly higher blood loss (P < .0001), contrast exposure (P < .0001), fluoroscopy time (P < .0001), and operative time (P < .0001). The temporary spinal cord ischemia rate was 13.6% (n = 3) for the T&E group and 6.0% for TA (P = .15); however, the permanent spinal cord ischemia rate was 4% for both groups (P = .96). The 30-day mortality for T&E was 4.5% (n = 1) compared with 2.1% (n = 10) for TA. Temporary renal injury (defined by a 25% increase over baseline creatinine) occurred in two T&E patients (9.1%), with none requiring permanent hemodialysis; no significant difference was noted between the two groups (P = .14). One-year mortality and freedom from reintervention in the T&E patients were 81% and 91%, respectively.\nAcceptable short-term morbidity and mortality can be achieved with T&E compared with TA, despite longer operative times, greater blood loss, and higher contrast exposure. There was a trend toward higher rates of renal and spinal cord injury, so implementation of strategies to reduce the potential of these complications or consideration of staged repair is recommended. Short-term reintervention rates are low, but longer follow-up and greater patient numbers are needed to determine procedural durability and applicability.",

Outcomes were compared between Shamblin class II and III CBTs treated with preoperative embolization (EMB group) and with no preoperative embolization (NEMB group).\nA total of 131 patients (80 women, 51 men), who were aged 48 years (range, 16-84 years), had resection of 144 CBTs and 12 concurrent cervical paragangliomas. This included 18 patients who had bilateral resections and 29 with familial CBTs. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDHx) mutations were confirmed in 17 patients. Mean tumor volume was 20.5 cm(3) (range, 0.8-101.3 cm(3)), and there were two biochemically active CBTs (1%). There were 71 Shamblin II and 33 Shamblin III. The EMB group underwent 33 CBT resections, and the NEMB group underwent 71. There were more patients in the EMB group with bilateral (48% vs 22%; P = .01) and familial (34% vs 14%; P = .01) CBT; otherwise, patient demographics, Shamblin class, and tumor diameter and volumes were similar. No strokes or other major complications occurred after preoperative embolization with polyvinyl alcohol particles 1 day before surgery. The EMB group required less extensive procedures (simple excision in 97% vs 82%, P = .03; internal carotid artery clamping in 15% vs 37%, P = .04) and had less blood loss (mean estimated blood loss, 263 vs 599 mL; P = .002) than the NEMB group. However, there were no significant differences in operative time (250 vs 265 minutes; P = .49), temporary cranial nerve injury (52% vs 38%; P = .21), clinically apparent cranial nerve deficits after 1 year (12% vs 7%; P = .46), deaths (0% vs 0%; P > .99), stroke (0% vs 1%; P > .99), or postoperative length of stay (4.1 vs 4.2 days; P = .91).\nLarge CBTs can be resected safely with or without preoperative embolization. Preoperative embolization may simplify the conduct of the operation and reduce blood loss but does not decrease rates of cranial nerve injury, although most are temporary.",

    "abstract": "This study presents the short-term and midterm results of direct percutaneous sac injection (DPSI) for postoperative endoleak treatment after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nBetween March 1994 and November 2011, EVAR was performed in 986 patients. The median follow-up was 63 \u00b1 45 months (range, 0-211 months). A retrospective analysis was performed. DPSI was used in 21 patients for 19 type II endoleaks and two endoleaks of undefined origin (EOUO), of which 12 (57%) were after failure of a previous endovascular treatment attempt.\nDPSI using thrombin (n = 16), coils (n = 7), gelfoam (n = 6), or glue (n = 3), or a combination, was technically feasible in all patients. Saccography during DPSI revealed a previously undetected type I endoleak in three patients. Immediate DPSI success was achieved in 16 of 18 procedures (88.9%), with two complications. Glue incidentally intravasated in the inferior vena cava, causing a clinically nonsignificant subsegmental pulmonary artery embolism in one patient, and the temporary development of a type III endoleak, possibly from graft puncture, in another. During a median follow-up of 39 months (interquartile range, 13-88 months) after DPSI, recurrent endoleaks were observed in nine patients (50.0%), one type I endoleak due to graft migration, five type II endoleaks, and three EOUO. The occurrence of a re-endoleak during follow-up was significantly associated with dual-antiplatelet medication (0% in patients without re-endoleak vs 44.4% in patients with re-endoleak; P = .023) and with a nonsignificant trend for the use of aspirin alone (33.3% in patients without re-endoleak vs 80% in patients with re-endoleak; P = .094). Re-endoleak occurred in 33.3% of the patients without antiplatelet medication and in 100% of patients with dual-antiplatelet medication (P = .026). Thrombin was used as the sole embolic agent during the initial DPSI in all patients with dual-antiplatelet therapy. No other factor was significantly associated with re-endoleaks. Reintervention was deemed necessary in six patients within a median of 10 months (interquartile range, 4-16 months) after DPSI, including six additional DPSI treatments in four patients with type II re-endoleaks, cuff placements in one type I endoleak, and endograft relining in one EOUO.\nThis initial experience suggests that DPSI is feasible as a technique for endoleak treatment after EVAR. However, complications and endoleak recurrence remain a concern. The role of antiplatelet therapy and different embolic agents on long-term embolization success needs to be studied in more detail.",

All patients treated with the Excluder endoprosthesis were included. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans were retrospectively analyzed preoperatively, at 30 days, and at the last follow-up using dedicated tridimensional reconstruction software. For patients with complications, all remaining CTAs were also analyzed. The primary end point was clinical success. Secondary end points were freedom from reintervention, sac growth, types I and III endoleak, migration, conversion to open repair, and AAA-related death or rupture. Neck dilatation, renal function, and overall survival were also analyzed.\nIncluded were 144 patients (88.2% men; mean age, 71.6 years). Aneurysms were ruptured in 4.9%. American Society of Anesthesiologists classification was III/IV in 61.8%. No patients were lost during a median follow-up of 5.0 years (interquartile range, 3.1-6.4; maximum, 11.2 years). Two patients died of medical complications \u2264 30 days after EVAR. The estimated primary clinical success rates at 5 and 10 years were 63.5% and 41.1%, and secondary clinical success rates were 78.3% and 58.3%, respectively. Sac growth was observed in 37 of 142 patients (26.1%). Cox regression showed type I endoleak during follow-up (hazard ratio, 3.74; P = .008), original design model (hazard ratio, 3.85; P = .001), and preoperative neck diameter (1.27 per mm increase, P = .006) were determinants of sac growth. Secondary interventions were required in 32 patients (22.5%). The estimated 10-year rate of AAA-related death or rupture was 2.1%. Overall life expectancy after AAA repair was 6.8 years.\nEVAR using the Excluder endoprosthesis provides a safe and lasting treatment for AAA, despite the need for maintained surveillance and secondary interventions. At up to 11 years, the risk of AAA-related death or postimplantation rupture is remarkably low. The incidences of postimplantation sac growth and secondary intervention were greatly reduced after the introduction of the low-permeability design in 2004.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms (IAAAs) have been traditionally managed with open repair. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was approved September of 1999. Some authors have suggested that EVAR is not an acceptable option for management of an IAAA. However, several recent reports have suggested EVAR is a reasonable management option in these patients. The purpose of our study was to review our experience with the contemporary management of IAAA involving both open and endovascular approaches.\nA retrospective review of all patients undergoing repair of IAAAs from 1999 to 2011 was conducted at three geographically separate institutions. Basic demographics, diagnostic workup, treatment, and outcomes were reviewed.\nBetween 1999 and 2011, 69 patients underwent surgical repair of IAAAs, 59 by open repair and 10 by EVAR. Eighty-three percent of patients were men with a mean age of 67. Aneurysm size was similar in both groups (6.3 cm open repair vs 5.9 cm EVAR). Follow-up for the open group was a mean of 42.6 months and 33.6 months for the EVAR group. Periaortic fibrosis decreased from a mean of 5.4 mm to 2.7 mm after EVAR. Hydronephrosis was present preoperatively in one patient and did not change after EVAR. Aneurysm size decreased in seven patients (70%) who underwent EVAR. Two patients had no change with one lost to follow-up. Mean aneurysm size decrease after EVAR was 1.12 cm (17.8%). There were no aneurysm-related deaths or major morbidities in the EVAR group. Twenty-two patients (37%) in the open surgical group suffered major complications, including myocardial infarction, renal failure, lower extremity amputation, sepsis, and prolonged ventilation.\nEndovascular repair for IAAA results in successful management with improvement of periaortic inflammation. EVAR should be considered as first-line therapy in which anatomic parameters are favorable.",

This series examines outcomes for tibial artery bypass using HePTFE and SVG over a contemporaneous time period.\nA retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted for 112 tibial bypasses (62 HePTFE, 50 SVG) performed from November 2006 to January 2009. Demographics for age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, and end-stage renal disease were similar. Indications for revascularization were also similar: disabling claudication, 9%; rest pain, 25%; and tissue loss, 66%. The HePTFE group included more reoperative procedures (45% vs 26%). All HePTFE bypasses were performed using an autologous vein patch at the distal anastomosis. Postoperative graft surveillance by pulse examination, ankle-brachial index, and duplex ultrasound imaging occurred at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 12 months. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis evaluated results in patients with no missing variables.\nHePTFE and SVG bypasses demonstrated no significant differences in target tibial artery distribution: anterior tibial (15 vs 17), dorsalis pedis (4 vs 5), posterior tibial (22 vs 16), and peroneal (21 vs 12). Graft occlusion occurred in 19 patients (16.9%) during follow-up. Primary patency at 1 year was 75.4% for HePTFE and 86.0% for SVG. There was no significant difference in primary patency due to sex (male, 78%; female, 84%), race (white, 82%; African American, 77%), or diabetes mellitus (no diabetes mellitus, 84%; diabetes mellitus, 76%). End-stage renal disease resulted in decreased patency (57%), with an eightfold reduction (95% confidence interval, 1.8%-39.8%; P = .006). SVG patients had a lower risk of occlusion/death (95% confidence interval, 14.2%-94.5%; P > .05). Sixteen amputations were performed, with no significant difference based on conduit.\nThis experience indicates a trend for single-segment quality saphenous vein to remain the conduit of choice for tibial artery bypass compared with HePTFE. Factors relevant to decreased 1-year patency for the entire cohort were end-stage renal disease and nonhealing ulceration as the indication for revascularization. Although relatively short-term, these results do support HePTFE as a viable alternative conduit for patients with absent or poor quality saphenous vein who need a tibial bypass.",

    "abstract": "Doxycycline and micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) modulate vein wall remodeling that may be associated with hypoxia in varicose veins (VVs), vein graft stenosis, and deep venous thrombosis. We recently reported that in vitro exposure of non-VV (NVVs) and VVs to hypoxic conditions activates the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. This study investigated the in vitro effects of doxycycline and MPFF on the HIF pathway in hypoxic NVVs and VVs.\nSix NVVs and six VVs obtained from surgery were used to prepare vein organ cultures, which were exposed to hypoxia (1% O(2)), with and without MPFF (10(-5) mol/L) or doxycycline (5 \u03bcg/mL) for 16 hours. The veins were analyzed for HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, and their target gene expression, with real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The differences between gene expressions were tested with one-way analysis of variance with repeated measures, followed by the Dunnett test for multiple comparisons. P < .05 was considered significant.\nTreatment of NVV organ cultures exposed to hypoxia with doxycycline or MPFF did not significantly alter the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 messenger (m)RNA and protein compared with untreated. Doxycycline also did not significantly affect the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 mRNA and protein in VVs exposed to hypoxia compared with untreated VVs. However, MPFF significantly reduced the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 but not HIF-2\u03b1 mRNA in VVs exposed to hypoxia compared with untreated VVs. Interestingly, the reduction of the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA in VVs by MPFF was not reflected at the protein level. The mRNA expression of HIF target genes, namely glucose transporter-1, carbonic anhydrase-9, vascular endothelial growth factor, B-cell lymphoma 2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa protein-interacting protein 3, prolyl hydroxylase domain-2, and prolyl hydroxylase domain-3, was not significantly altered in NVVs and VVs exposed to hypoxia and treated with doxycycline or MPFF compared with those untreated.\nDoxycycline and MPFF at a concentration corresponding to a therapeutic dose do not alter the activation of the HIF pathway in NVV and VV organ cultures exposed to hypoxia. Our findings suggest vein wall remodeling actions in NVVs and VVs are likely not HIF-dependent.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the costs and comparative cost-effectiveness of two methods of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in the Open Versus Endovascular Repair (OVER) Veterans Affairs (VA) Cooperative Study, a multicenter randomized trial of 881 patients.\nThe primary outcomes of this analysis were mean total health care cost per life-year and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) from randomization to 2 years after. QALYs were calculated from EuroQol (EQ)-5D questionnaires collected at baseline and annually. Health care utilization data were obtained directly from patients and from national VA and Medicare data sources. VA costs were obtained from national VA sources using methods previously developed by the VA Health Economics Resource Center. Costs for non-VA care were determined from Medicare claims data or billing data from the patient's health care providers.\nAfter 2 years of follow-up, mean life-years were 1.78 in the endovascular repair group and 1.74 in the open repair group (difference, 0.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.03 to 0.09; P = .29). Mean QALYs were 1.462 in the endovascular group and 1.461 in the open group (difference adjusting for baseline EQ-5D score, 0.006; 95% CI, -0.038 to 0.052; P = .78). Mean graft costs were higher in the endovascular group ($14,052 vs $1363; P < .001), but length of stay was shorter (5.0 vs 10.5 days; P < .001), resulting in a lower mean cost of the hospital admission for the AAA procedure in the endovascular repair group of $37,068 vs $42,970 (difference, -$5901; 95% CI, -$12,135 to -$821; P = .04). After 2 years, total health care costs remained lower in the endovascular group, but the difference was no longer significant (-$5019; 95% CI, -$16,720 to $4928; P = .35). The probability of endovascular repair being less costly and more effective was 70.9% for life-years and 51.4% for QALYs.\nIn this multicenter randomized trial, endovascular AAA repair resulted in lower cost and better survival than open repair after the initial hospitalization for repair; but after 2 years, survival, quality of life, and costs were not significantly different between the two treatments.",

    "abstract": "Optimal selection of a revascularization strategy in femoropopliteal occlusive disease (FPOD) remains controversial. Among endovascular treatment options for FPOD, covered stent placement has become increasingly used. We sought to examine the influence of clinical, anatomic, and device-related characteristics on the clinical performance of these devices.\nThis was a retrospective, single-center study of consecutively treated limbs that underwent Viabahn (W. L. Gore, Flagstaff, Ariz) stent graft placement for FPOD from 2005 to 2010. Clinical, anatomic, and device-related characteristics were obtained from review of medical records and angiograms. End points were occurrence of any reintervention, major adverse limb event (eg, major amputation, thrombolysis/thrombectomy, or open bypass surgery), or thrombolysis/thrombectomy treatment alone. Univariate predictors were calculated and multivariate models constructed for each clinical end point using Cox proportional hazards models.\nThe study cohort included 87 limbs in 77 unique patients, with a median follow-up time of 382 days. The indication for intervention was claudication in 56%. In 25 cases (29%), the index procedure was a secondary intervention for FPOD, including treatment of in-stent restenosis in 22 cases (25%). Lesions treated included 45% TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II D and 58% chronic total occlusions. The observed Kaplan-Meier 1-year event rates for reintervention, major adverse limb event (MALE), and thrombolysis were 43%, 28%, and 17%, respectively. MALE occurred in 18 patients, nine of whom presented with acute limb ischemia; no patient underwent major amputation. Univariate predictors of negative outcomes included lack of dual-antiplatelet usage, advanced TASC II classification, smaller implant diameter, increased number of devices used, longer total implant length, and coverage of a patent distal collateral vessel. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of dual-antiplatelet usage was protective against all three outcomes, 5-mm device diameter was a risk factor for both reintervention and MALE, and the use of multiple devices and distal collateral coverage were significant risk factors for thrombolysis events.\nReintervention is common in the first year after Viabahn placement for FPOD, with more than half of the events being a MALE. Procedural factors such as antiplatelet therapy, stent graft diameter, implant length/number, and distal collateral coverage are strongly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. These factors should be carefully considered to optimize patient selection and intraoperative decision making for this procedure.",

    "abstract": "The published correlations between treadmill performance and the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) score are generally fair. We hypothesized that the slope of the relationship of maximal treadmill walking time to WIQ would be lower in older than in younger patients, resulting in (1) a fair correlation in the population considered as a whole and (2) different cutoff points of the WIQ score to predict the ability to complete 5 minutes of treadmill walking in different age groups.\nA 9-month prospective study was performed among patients referred for vascular-type claudication. Patients were divided into three age groups by years: <60 (group 1, n = 91), 60 to 70 (group 2, n = 80), and >70 (group 3, n = 77). Patients self-completed the WIQ, which was corrected with a nurse, if necessary, and then completed a treadmill test. We calculated the correlation coefficient and slope of the relationship between the WIQ and maximal treadmill walking time. We used receiver operating characteristics curve analysis to estimate the accuracy of the WIQ score to determine the ability of the patients to complete 5 minutes of treadmill walking.\nDifferences in slopes were significant between groups 1 vs 2 (P = .02), 2 vs 3 (P < .002), and 1 vs 3 (P < .001). The R(2) for the regression lines also tended to decrease but was only significant between two extremes (1 vs 2, P = .11; 2 vs 3, P = .07; 1 vs 3, P < .001). In patients aged <60 years (group 1), a WIQ score of 47 predicted the ability to complete a 5-minute test on treadmill with 86.8% accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.906; P < .001). The accuracy in predicting treadmill results from the WIQ score was fair in group 2 and nonsignificant in group 3.\nPrediction of treadmill walking capacity from the WIQ score should account for age. The TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus suggests that self-reported limitation has an equal weight as measured walking distance in the treatment choices and follow-up of patients with peripheral arterial disease. The WIQ should probably be used with caution in clinical routine, and constant-load treadmill testing is probably not the ideal candidate in elderly patients. New or adapted tools are likely needed in such patients but remain to be studied.",

    "abstract": "We sought to determine the safety and efficacy of two different treatment strategies for patients with primary infected aortic aneurysms, including antibiotic treatment alone and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with aggressive antibiotic treatment, as alternatives to the established treatment of open surgical repair.\nWe conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who were treated for infected aortic aneurysm without undergoing aortic resection from January 2000 to December 2010 at a single institution.\nA total of 40 patients underwent traditional open repair during the study period. Sixteen patients with infected aortic aneurysm (11 men; median age, 70; range, 44-80 years) were identified as not having undergone aortic resection during the 11 years reviewed in the study. Nine patients received antibiotic treatment only (group I) and seven patients underwent EVAR with aggressive antibiotic treatment (group II). Salmonella species were isolated from seven patients in group I, and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the remaining two patients. In group II, six patients had blood culture results showing Salmonella species and one patient had a blood culture result showing Escherichia coli. Group I (7 of 9 patients; 78%) had a higher hospital mortality rate than group II (0%; P = .003). Mean follow-up among survivors was 10 \u00b1 15 months (range, 1-37 months). One patient in group II developed a reinfection episode (14%). There was no significant difference between group I (67%; SE, 27.2%) and group II (86%; SE, 13.2%) in the 3-month survival rates (log-rank, P = .39).\nOur results support the premise that EVAR is beneficial for the patients with infected aortic aneurysm. Treating an infected aortic aneurysm with antibiotics alone could not stop aneurysm expansion and eradicate the aortic infection before the aneurysm ruptures. For the patients with infected aortic aneurysms who have limited life expectancy and multiple comorbidities, EVAR with aggressive antibiotic treatment should be considered preferentially over antibiotic treatment alone.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze our experience of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in patients with traumatic aortic transection.\nThis was a single-center consecutive case series that was conducted at the Uppsala University Hospital, Tertiary Referral Center. There were a total of 17 consecutive patients undergoing TEVAR for traumatic thoracic aortic transection. All patients undergoing TEVAR for aortic transection were registered prospectively and their medical records were reviewed regarding technical details, mechanism of injury, and concomitant injuries. Long-term outcome was analyzed with respect to need for reintervention and survival.\nBetween 2001 and 2010, 17 patients underwent TEVAR for traumatic aortic injury. Median age was 42 years (range, 18-77 years), and 15 of 17 patients (88%) were men. Fourteen patients had been involved in motor vehicle accidents, two had fallen from heights, and one fell off a bicycle on a slope. In all cases, the aortic injury was located in the proximity of the origin of the left subclavian artery. All patients had concomitant injuries. In all patients, a single stent graft was sufficient to exclude the injured part of the aorta. The median cover length was 120 mm (range, 100-200 mm). In-hospital mortality was 24% (4 of 17 patients). One patient died perioperatively and three postoperatively, two from brain injuries and one from multiorgan failure. After a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 10-98 months), three patients underwent reintervention (18%), each patient only once; one for a type I endoleak, and two for pseudocoarctation secondary to stent graft infolding. Two were treated endovascularly, and one had a stent graft explantation.\nEndovascular repair allows rapid and minimally invasive therapy in patients with traumatic aortic injury with good technical results. The outcome is highly dependent on the severity of other concurrent injuries.",

Fourteen patients had been involved in motor vehicle accidents, two had fallen from heights, and one fell off a bicycle on a slope. In all cases, the aortic injury was located in the proximity of the origin of the left subclavian artery. All patients had concomitant injuries. In all patients, a single stent graft was sufficient to exclude the injured part of the aorta. The median cover length was 120 mm (range, 100-200 mm). In-hospital mortality was 24% (4 of 17 patients). One patient died perioperatively and three postoperatively, two from brain injuries and one from multiorgan failure. After a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 10-98 months), three patients underwent reintervention (18%), each patient only once; one for a type I endoleak, and two for pseudocoarctation secondary to stent graft infolding. Two were treated endovascularly, and one had a stent graft explantation.",

    "abstract": "Several published studies have reported differing results of renal duplex ultrasound (RDU) imaging in detecting significant renal artery stenosis (RAS) using different Doppler parameters. This study is the largest to date to compare RDU imaging vs angiography and assess various published Doppler criteria.\nRDU imaging and angiography were both done in 313 patients (606 renal arteries). RAS was classified as normal, <60%, \u2265 60% to 99%, and occlusion. Main outcome measurements included renal peak systolic velocity (PSV), systolic renal-to-aortic ratio (RAR), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), and kidney lengths.\nThe mean PSVs and RARs for normal, <60%, and \u2265 60% stenosis were 173, 236, and 324 cm/s (P < .0001), and 2.2, 2.9, and 4.5, respectively (P < .0001). The PSV cutoff value that provided the best overall accuracy for \u2265 60% stenosis was 285 cm/s, with a sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 67%, 90%, and 81%, respectively. The RAR cutoff value with the best overall accuracy for \u2265 60% stenosis was 3.7, with a sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 69%, 91%, and 82%, respectively. A PSV of \u2265 180 cm/s and RAR of \u2265 3.5 had a sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 72%, 81%, and 78% in detecting \u2265 60% stenosis. A PSV of \u2265 200 cm/s with an RAR of \u2265 3.5 had a sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 72%, 83%, and 78% in detecting \u2265 60% stenosis. A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the PSV and RAR were better than the EDV in detecting \u2265 60% stenosis: PSV area under the curve (AUC) was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.88), EDV AUC was 0.71, and RAR AUC was 0.82 (PSV vs EDV, P < .0001; PSV vs RAR, P = .075; EDV vs RAR, P < .0001). A PSV of 285 cm/s or RAR of 3.7 alone were better than any combination of PSVs, EDVs, or RARs in detecting \u2265 60% stenosis. The mean kidney length was 10.4 cm in patients with \u2265 60% stenosis vs 11.0 cm in patients with <60% stenosis (P < .0001). Twelve percent of patients with \u2265 60% stenosis had a kidney length of \u2264 8.5 cm vs 4% in patients with <60% stenosis (P = .0003), and 5.6% (34 of 606) had accessory renal arteries on angiography, with six detected on RDU imaging. The presence of accessory renal arteries, solitary kidneys, or renal fibromuscular dysplasia had no influence on overall accuracy of using PSV values for detecting \u2265 60% stenosis.\nA PSV of 285 cm/s or an RAR of 3.7 alone can be used in detecting \u2265 60% RAS. Previously published data must be validated in individual vascular laboratories.",

    "abstract": "During endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), blood is trapped in the aneurysm sac at the moment the endograft is deployed. It is generally assumed that this blood will coagulate and evolve into an organized thrombus. It is unknown whether this process always occurs, what its time span is, and how it influences aneurysm shrinkage. With magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), quantitative analysis of the aneurysm sac is possible in terms of endoleak volume as well as unorganized thrombus volume and organized thrombus volume. We investigated the presence of unorganized thrombus in nonshrinking aneurysms years after EVAR.\nFourteen patients with a nonshrinking aneurysm without endoleak on computed tomography/computed tomography angiography underwent MRI with a blood pool agent (gadofosveset trisodium). Precontrast T1-, precontrast T2-, and postcontrast T1-weighted images (3 and 30 minutes after injection) were acquired and evaluated for the presence of endoleak. The aneurysm sac was segmented into endoleak, unorganized thrombus, and organized thrombus by interactively thresholding the differently weighted images. The classification was visualized in real-time as a color overlay on the MR images. The volumes of endoleak, unorganized thrombus, and organized thrombus were calculated.\nMedian time after EVAR was 2 years (range, 1-8.2 years). The average aneurysm sac volume of the patients was 167 \u00b1 107 mL (mean \u00b1 standard deviation). Nine patients had an endoleak on the postcontrast T1-w images 30 minutes after injection. On average, the aneurysm sac contained 78 \u00b1 61 mL unorganized thrombus, which corresponded to 51 \u00b1 21 volume-percentage, irrespective of the presence of an endoleak on the blood pool agent enhanced MRI images (independent t-test, P = .8).\nIn our study group, half of the nonshrinking aneurysm sac contents consisted of unorganized thrombus years after EVAR.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) vs endarterectomy (CEA) remains controversial and has been the topic of recent randomized controlled trials. The purpose of this study was to compare the practice and outcomes of CAS and CEA in a real world setting.\nThis is a retrospective analysis of 7649 CEA and 430 CAS performed at 17 centers from 2003 to 2010 within the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE). The primary outcome measures were (1) any in-hospital stroke or death and (2) any stroke, death, or myocardial infarction (MI). Patients undergoing CEA in conjunction with cardiac surgery were excluded. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of stroke or death in patients undergoing CAS.\nCEA was performed in 17 centers by 111 surgeons, while CAS was performed in 6 centers by 30 surgeons and 8 interventionalists. Patient characteristics varied by procedure. Patients undergoing CAS had a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and prior ipsilateral CEA. Embolic protection was used in 97% of CAS. Shunts were used in 48% and patches in 86% of CEA. The overall in-hospital stroke or death rate was higher among patients undergoing CAS (2.3% vs 1.1%; P = .03). Overall stroke, death, or MI (2.8% CAS vs 2.1% CEA; P = .32) were not different. Asymptomatic patients had similar rates of stroke or death (CAS 0.73% vs CEA 0.89%; P = .78) and stroke, death, or MI (CAS 1.1% vs CEA 1.8%; P = .40). Symptomatic patients undergoing CAS had higher rates of stroke or death (5.1% vs 1.6%; P = .001), and stroke, death, or MI (5.8% vs 2.7%; P = .02). By multivariate analysis, major stroke (odds ratio, 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-10.8), minor stroke (2.7; CI, 1.5-4.8), prior ipsilateral CEA (3.2, CI, 1.7-6.1), age >80 (2.1; CI, 1.3-3.4), hypertension (2.6; CI, 1.0-6.3), and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.6; CI, 1.0-2.4) were predictors of stroke or death in patients undergoing carotid revascularization.\nIn our regional vascular surgical practices, the overall outcomes of CAS and CEA are similar for asymptomatic patients.

    "abstract": "Amniotic membrane, as a natural biomaterial, has many advantages, such as low immunogenicity, anti-inflammation, antifibrosis, and rich extracellular matrix components, which make it a promising source for vascular tissue engineering. This study assessed the feasibility of constructing a vein conduit from the amniotic membrane and implanting it in the external jugular vein of juvenile sheep.\nHuman amniotic membrane was prepared using fresh human placenta. For construction of a tube such as a vein, the membrane was rolled around a tube and amniotic membrane-constructed conduits were interposed to the external jugular vein by end-to-end anastomosis. Grafts were assessed for patency at weeks 5 and 48 and explanted for evaluation with histologic and microscopic techniques.\nAt 5 weeks after implantation, the grafts were completely patent and displayed no signs of dilation. The internal surface was smooth and shiny, without any evidence of thrombus formation.

    "abstract": "Walking with high-heeled shoes is a common cause of venous complaints such as pain, fatigue, and heavy-feeling legs. The aim of the study was to clarify the influence of high-heeled shoes on the venous return and test the hypothesis that women wearing different styles of high-heeled shoes present an impaired venous return when compared with their values when they are barefoot.\nThirty asymptomatic women (mean age, 26.4 years) wearing appropriately sized shoes were evaluated by air plethysmography (APG), a test that measures changes in air volume on a cuff placed on the calf, while they performed orthostatic flexion and extension foot movements and altered standing up and lying down. The test was repeated in four situations: barefoot (0 cm), medium heels (3.5 cm), stiletto high heels (7 cm), and platform high heels (7 cm). The APG values of venous filling index (VFI), ejection fraction (EF), and residual volume fraction (RVF) were divided into four groups according to heel height and compared by repeated-measures analysis of variance.\nRVF was increased in the groups wearing high heels (stiletto and platform) compared with the barefoot group (P < .05). RVF was increased in the medium-heel group (3.5 cm) compared with the barefoot group (P < .05), and despite the lack of statistical significance, the medium-heel group showed lower values of RVF compared with the two high-heel groups. The EF parameter followed the opposite tendency, showing higher values for the barefoot group compared with the other three groups (P < .05). Values for VFI were similar in the three situations evaluated.\nHigh heels reduce muscle pump function, as demonstrated by reduced EF and increased RVF values. The continuous use of high heels tends to provoke venous hypertension in the lower limbs and may represent a causal factor of venous disease symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid repair of the transverse aortic arch may allow for aortic arch repair with reduced morbidity in patients who are suboptimal candidates for conventional open surgery. We present our results with an algorithmic approach to hybrid arch repair, based on the extent of aortic disease and patient comorbidities.\nBetween August 2005 and January 2012, 87 patients underwent hybrid arch repair by three principal procedures: zone 1 endograft coverage with extra-anatomic left carotid revascularization (zone 1; n = 19), zone 0 endograft coverage with aortic arch debranching (zone 0; n = 48), or total arch replacement with staged stented elephant trunk completion (stented elephant trunk; n = 20).\nThe mean patient age was 64 years, and the mean expected in-hospital mortality rate was 16.3% as calculated by the EuroSCORE II. Of operations, 22% (n = 19) were nonelective. Sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest were required in 78% (n = 68), 45% (n = 39), and 31% (n = 27) of patients to allow for total arch replacement, arch debranching, or other concomitant cardiac procedures, including ascending with or without hemiarch replacement in 17% (n = 8) of patients undergoing zone 0 repair. All stented elephant trunk procedures (n = 20) and 19% (n = 9) of zone 0 procedures were staged, with 41% (n = 12) of patients undergoing staged repair during a single hospitalization. The 30-day/in-hospital rates of stroke and permanent paraplegia or paraparesis were 4.6% (n = 4) and 1.2% (n = 1). Of 27 patients with native ascending aorta zone 0 proximal landing zone, three (11.1%) experienced retrograde type A dissection after endograft placement. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 5.7% (n = 5); however, 30-day/in-hospital mortality increased to 14.9% (n = 13) owing to eight 30-day out-of-hospital deaths. Native ascending aorta zone 0 endograft placement was found to be the only univariate predictor of 30-day in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 4.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-15.89; P = .02). Over a mean follow-up period of 28.5 \u00b1 22.2 months, 13% (n = 11) of patients required reintervention for type 1A (n = 4), type 2 (n = 6), or type 3 (n = 1) endoleak. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years were 73%, 60%, and 51%.\nHybrid aortic arch repair can be tailored to patient anatomy and comorbid status to allow complete repair of aortic pathology, frequently in a single stage, with acceptable outcomes. However, endograft placement in the native ascending aorta is associated with high rates of retrograde type A dissection and 30-day/in-hospital mortality and should be approached with caution.",

    "abstract": "Patients with aneurysmal and occlusive arterial disease have overlapping cardiovascular risk profiles. The question remains how atherosclerosis is related to the formation of aortic aneurysms. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) is an easily accessible and objective marker of early atherosclerosis. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether there is a difference in atherosclerotic burden as measured by CIMT between patients with aneurysmal and those with occlusive arterial disease.\nFrom 2004 to 2011, the CIMT was measured using B-mode ultrasound scanning in patients undergoing vascular surgery for aortic aneurysmal or occlusive arterial disease at the Erasmus University Medical Center. Cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and medication were recorded. Patients treated for combined aneurysmal and occlusive arterial disease and patients diagnosed with a genetic aneurysm syndrome were excluded. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to calculate differences in CIMT between aneurysmal and occlusive arterial disease.\nIn total, 904 patients were included in the study: 502 patients with aneurysmal disease (85% male; mean age, 72 years) and 402 patients with occlusive arterial disease (65% male; mean age, 64 years). The mean (standard deviation) CIMT in patients with aneurysmal disease was 0.97 (0.29) mm and was 1.07 (0.38) mm in patients with occlusive arterial disease (P < .001). Adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and medication showed a mean difference in CIMT of 0.15 mm (95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.20; P < .001).\nThe current study shows a lower CIMT in patients with aneurysmal disease than in those with occlusive arterial disease, indicating a lower atherosclerotic burden in patients with aneurysmal disease. These findings endorse the idea that additional pathogenic mechanisms are involved in aortic aneurysm formation. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of atherosclerosis in aortic aneurysm formation.",

We examined the effect of treatment patterns and outcomes, by race, for isolated thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA).\nUsing Medicare claims (1999-2007), we studied all patients undergoing repair of TAAs, via open surgery or thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR). We studied 30-day mortality and complications by race, procedure type, and hospital volume.\nWe studied 12,573 patients who underwent open TAA repair (4% of whom were black) and 2732 patients who underwent TEVAR (8% of whom were black). In open repair, black patients had higher 30-day mortality than white patients (18% vs 10%; P<.001), while mortality rates were similar with TEVAR (8% black vs 9% white; P=.56). For open repair, black patients were more likely to undergo surgery at low-volume hospitals, where overall operative mortality was highest (14% at very low-volume hospitals, 7% at very high-volume hospitals; P<.001). However, for TEVAR, black patients were not more likely to undergo repair at low-volume hospitals, and mortality differences were not evident across volume strata (9% at very low-volume hospitals, 7% at very high-volume hospitals; P=.328). Multivariable analyses adjusting for age, sex, race, comorbidity, and volume confirmed that increased perioperative mortality was associated with black race for open surgery (OR, 2.0, 95% CI, 1.5-2.5; P<.001) but not TEVAR (OR, 0.9, 95% CI, 0.6-1.5; P=.721).\nWhile racial disparities in surgical care have a significant effect on mortality with open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair, black patients undergoing TEVAR obtain similar outcomes as white patients.

In addition, we evaluated the relationship between reactive astrogliosis and gray or white matter injury after spinal cord ischemia with a 1\u00b0C reduction in body temperature or normothermia.\nRats were randomly divided into hypothermia (1\u00b0C decrease in body temperature to 36.3\u00b0C), normothermia (37.3\u00b0C), and sham surgery groups (n=6/group). Hypothermia was induced 15 minutes before ischemia and maintained during ischemia. Animals were then rewarmed to normothermia. Spinal cord ischemia was induced by a balloon catheter in the thoracic aorta, and the proximal mean arterial blood pressure was maintained at 40 mm Hg for 14 minutes. Hind limb motor function was assessed at 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after reperfusion. At 28 days after reperfusion, gray matter damage was assessed by counting the number of normal motor neurons and white matter damage by the extent of vacuolation. The glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive area fraction (GFAP%) was determined in white and gray matter structures to measure reactive astrogliosis.\nCompared with normothermia, hypothermia significantly improved hind limb function at all assessments (P<.01) and increased numbers of normal gray matter motor neurons (39\u00b120 vs 99\u00b113, respectively; P<.001), decreased the percentage area of white matter vacuolation (9.0%\u00b12.7% vs 1.6%\u00b11.3%, respectively; P=.001), and decreased the GFAP% in gray (P=.003) and white matter (P=.009).\nProphylactic mild hypothermia (1\u00b0C reduction in body temperature) preserved hind limb motor function and reduced neuronal death, white matter vacuolation, and astrogliosis in gray and white matter induced by spinal cord ischemia in rats. Thus, mild hypothermia may be useful for perioperative management of thoracoabdominal aortic surgery.",

    "abstract": "First rib resection and scalenectomy (FRRS) has been shown to improve short-term quality of life (QOL) in the treatment of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (NTOS). Long-term benefits are not well studied but are believed to decrease over time. Our objective was to evaluate long-term NTOS outcomes using validated QOL instruments.\nWe identified 162 NTOS patients aged \u226518 years treated by FRRS from 2003 to 2010 after they had not responded to conservative management. The patients were mailed three surveys to assess QOL (Short-Form 12 [SF-12], Brief Pain Inventory [BPI], and Cervical Brachial Symptom Questionnaire [CBSQ]), with five total outcomes measures including the SF-12 Physical Component Score (PCS), SF-12 Mental Component Score (MCS), BPI severity, BPI interference, and CBSQ score. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from patient records. Each FRRS was categorized based on postoperative clinical assessment as successful, failed, or leading to recurrent symptoms.\nSurvey yield was 53.7% (n\u00a0= 87) with mean follow-up of 44.7 months (range, 12.4-91.9 months). There was no significant difference in QOL scores associated with long-term compared with short-term follow-up. Significantly poorer scores on all instruments were associated with comorbid chronic pain syndromes, opioid use, and unfavorable clinical assessment (P\u00a0< .05). Significantly poorer scores on select instruments were associated with smoking (BPI both; P\u00a0< .02), age \u226540 years (SF-12 PCS, BPI interference, CBSQ; P\u00a0< .03), neck and/or shoulder disease (SF-12 both, BPI both; P\u00a0< .01), postoperative injections (BPI both, CBSQ; P\u00a0< .05), and complications (SF-12 PCS, CBSQ; P\u00a0< .05). A positive preoperative scalene block was not significantly associated with long-term QOL scores.\nThe QOL after FRRS shows no significant difference with longer follow-up. Clinical assessment reflects patient-reported outcomes and can gauge postoperative improvement. Patient factors, particularly comorbidities and opioid use, are more predictive of long-term QOL than is preoperative scalene block and should also be considered when selecting patients for surgical intervention.",

    "abstract": "Scoring systems for predicting mortality after repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAAs) have not been developed or tested in a United States population and may not be accurate in the endovascular era. Using prospectively collected data from the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE), we developed a practical risk score for in-hospital mortality after open repair of RAAAs and compared its performance to that of the Glasgow aneurysm score, Hardman index, Vancouver score, and Edinburg ruptured aneurysm score.\nUnivariate analysis followed by multivariable analysis of patient, prehospital, anatomic, and procedural characteristics identified significant predictors of in-hospital mortality. Integer points were derived from the odds ratio (OR) for mortality based on each independent predictor in order to generate a VSGNE RAAA risk score, which was internally validated using bootstrapping methodology. Discrimination and calibration of all models were assessed by calculating the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (C-statistic) and applying the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.\nFrom 2003 to 2009, 242 patients underwent open repair of RAAAs at 10 centers. In-hospital mortality was 38% (n\u00a0= 91). Independent predictors of mortality included age >76 years (OR, 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-10.1), preoperative cardiac arrest (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.6-12), loss of consciousness (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-6), and suprarenal aortic clamp (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.6). Patient stratification according to the VSGNE RAAA risk score (range, 0-6) accurately predicted mortality and identified those at low and high risk for death (8%, 25%, 37%, 60%, 80%, and 87% for scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and \u22655, respectively). Discrimination (C\u00a0= .79) and calibration (\u03c7(2)\u00a0= 1.96; P\u00a0= .85) were excellent in the derivation and bootstrap samples and superior to that of existing scoring systems. The Glasgow aneurysm score, Hardman index, Vancouver score, and Edinburg ruptured aneurysm score correlated with mortality in the VSGNE cohort but failed to identify accurately patients with a risk of mortality >65%.\nExisting scoring systems predict mortality after RAAA repair in this cohort but do not identify patients at highest risk. This parsimonious VSGNE RAAA risk score based on four variables readily assessed at the time of presentation allows accurate prediction of in-hospital mortality after open repair of RAAAs, including identification of those patients at highest risk for postoperative mortality.",

The design of the study was a systematic review of the literature pertaining to post-thrombotic syndrome.\nA systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines by a search of PubMed (1948 to September 2011) using the search terms \"post-thrombotic syndrome,\" \"postthrombotic syndrome,\" \"post-phlebitic syndrome,\" and \"postphlebitic syndrome.\" A manual reference list search was also carried out to identify further studies that would be appropriate for inclusion. The various scoring systems in use were identified and assessed against a list of criteria to determine their validity for use. For outcome measures, each scoring system was assessed for specific criteria, including interobserver reliability, association with ambulatory venous pressures, ability to assess severity of post-thrombotic syndrome, ability to assess change in condition over time, and association with patient-reported symptom severity.\nThe Villalta, Ginsberg, Brandjes, Widmer, CEAP, and Venous Clinical Severity Score systems all were assessed for the stated outcome measures. From their use in the literature, only the Villalta score was able to fulfill all the criteria described. The main criticism of the Villalta score in the literature appears to be its use of subjective measures. To that end, we propose that use of a venous disease-specific quality-of-life questionnaire in combination with the Villalta score may help standardize the subjective criteria.\nThe Villalta score, combined with a venous disease-specific quality-of-life questionnaire, should be considered the \"gold standard\" for the diagnosis and classification of post-thrombotic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) represents a social and health care problem because it affects working age populations, particularly in jobs requiring orthostasis, has no effective pharmacologic treatment, and requires surgery. Oxidative stress is present in varicose veins, but whether this is reflected in the plasma is controversial. We aimed to quantify plasma oxidative stress biomarkers in the early stages of CVI and calculate a global index of oxidative stress representative of the disease.\nPlasma was obtained from blood samples of nine patients with CEAP C2 stage CVI and 10 healthy controls. Biomarkers related to antioxidant defense systems (total thiols, reduced glutathione, uric acid, total antioxidant capacity, catalase), oxidative damage (malondialdehyde-bound protein, protein carbonyls, advanced oxidation products, and 3-nitrotyrosine), and activity of enzymes producing key free radicals (xanthine oxidase and myeloperoxidase) were assessed.\nCompared with the controls, CVI patients exhibited decreased catalase activity and thiol levels and increased malondialdehyde-bound protein and protein carbonyls. These parameters were used to calculate the global index of oxidative stress in CVI, which was significantly different between groups.\nIt is possible to detect significant changes in plasma oxidative stress biomarkers in early stages of CVI and to calculate a global index representative of the oxidative status in an individual. This index, with the appropriate validation in a larger population, could be used for early detection or progression of CVI.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether wall growth during aneurysm development spares the aortic wall between the intercostal or lumbar arteries or, alternatively, is uniform around the circumference.\nComputed tomography scans of 155 patients with aortic aneurysms (40 thoracic, 50 thoracoabdominal, and 65 abdominal) in a single hospital of a large academic institution were retrospectively inspected. Computed tomography studies of 100 control subjects (40 thoracic and 60 abdominal) were also reviewed. In all 255 patients, the ratio of the arc length between the origins of the intercostal or lumbar arteries (interbranch arc length) to the remainder of the aortic residual circumference was calculated. These ratios were compared between all subjects with aneurysms and the controls at each vertebral body level and between those with thoracic or thoracoabdominal or abdominal aneurysms and controls at each vertebral body level.\nInterbranch arc lengths and residual aortic circumferences were larger in aneurysm patients than in control subjects, but the differences were statistically significant only at T4 and from T8 to L4 (P\u00a0= .009 to P < .001) and from T4 to L4 (P < .001), respectively. The ratio of interbranch arc length to residual circumference in aneurysmal aortas was significantly smaller than that in controls at 12 out of 13 levels from T4 to L4 (P\u00a0= .004 to P < .001). There was a statistically significant smaller ratio at 8 out of 9 levels for thoracic aneurysms (P\u00a0= .006 to P < .001), 12 out of 13 levels for thoracoabdominal aneurysms (P\u00a0= .008 to P < .001), and 3 out of 4 levels for abdominal aneurysms compared with controls (P\u00a0= .006 to P < .001).\nWall growth in aortic aneurysms is asymmetric, with greater aneurysmal growth in the anterior aorta wall and relative sparing of the portion of aortic wall between the intercostal or lumbar arteries. The mechanisms effecting this asymmetric growth have not been fully characterized.",

    "abstract": "This single-center, prospective study aimed to investigate the technical success and outcome of intentional coverage of the left subclavian artery (LSA) in patients undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for traumatic rupture of the aortic isthmus at a tertiary care medical center.\nFrom January 2005 to June 2011, patients who presented with traumatic aortic transection underwent TEVAR with coverage of the LSA when the distance between the artery and the rupture was <2 cm. At 12, 24, and 72 hours postoperatively, clinical and neurologic evaluation including transcranial Doppler insonation of the brachial artery was performed. A decrease in peak systolic velocity (PSV) >60% with respect to the contralateral one was considered relevant. Functional status of the left arm was evaluated using a provocative test. Thoracoabdominal computerized tomographic angiography was performed postoperatively at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up.\nThirty-one patients (mean age 35 years) underwent emergency TEVAR for traumatic aortic transection with intentional LSA coverage during the study period. In four cases (12.9%) coverage was partial. Two patients (6.4%) died during the postoperative period due to associated lesions. No signs of vertebrobasilar insufficiency, stroke, or paraplegia were observed in any of the patients. Nine patients (36%) had severe arm claudication (ischemic pain within 60 seconds of beginning arm exercise and decrease of PSV between 50% and 60%). Risk factors for the condition were left vertebral artery diameter <3 mm (P < .0001). A significant correlation was found between the degree of PSV reduction and left arm symptoms (P < .0001). There was an improvement in ischemic arm symptoms (P < .0001) during mean follow-up of 36 months (range, 6-65 months), with only one patient (4.2%) presenting with severe claudication. Freedom from reintervention at 48 months was 93.5%. No signs of endoleaks or graft migrations were detected on computerized tomographic angiography control scans.\nCoverage of the LSA during TEVAR for traumatic aortic injuries appears to be a feasible, safe method for extending the endograft landing zone without increasing the risk of paraplegia, stroke, or left arm ischemia. Left vertebral artery diameter can be used to identify patients at risk for postoperative left arm ischemia.",

    "abstract": "To compare long-term results of percutaneous iliac artery stenting (PCIS) with aortobifemoral (ABF) grafting for patients with symptomatic iliac artery occlusions.\nA retrospective review of 229 patients (January 2000 to December 2011) with symptomatic iliac artery occlusions was performed. In 100 patients, 103 PCIS procedures were performed, and 101 patients underwent ABF grafting. Outcome data including periprocedural complications, improvement in ankle-brachial index, morbidity, and mortality were collected in a vascular registry. Kaplan-Meier estimates for patency and survival were analyzed. Univariate (Fisher exact test) and multivariate analyses of variables associated with the loss of primary patency were performed.\nPatients in the ABF grafting group were younger (60 \u00b1 0.9 years old vs 65 \u00b1 1.2 years old; P = .002) and more commonly had a history of nicotine abuse (97% vs 86%; P = .002), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (85% vs 70%; P = .02), and a greater incidence of superficial femoral artery disease (45% vs 24%; P = .001). The most common presenting symptoms in both groups consisted of intermittent claudication (66% ABF vs 71% PCIS), rest pain (20% ABF vs 17% PCIS), and ulceration or gangrene of toes (14% ABF vs 15% PCIS). At 72 months, the primary patency for ABF bypass was greater than for PCIS (91% vs 73%; P = .010). Secondary patency rates were equivalent in both groups (98% ABF vs 85% PCIS). Survival in the ABF bypass group was significantly greater than in the PCIS group (76% vs 68%; P = .013). Hyperlipidemia (hazard ratio, 2.55; P = .049) and concurrent superficial femoral artery lesion (hazard ratio, 2.61; P = .026) were factors associated with the loss of primary patency for the entire cohort. The average hospital stay was 7 \u00b1 2 days in the ABF group and 1 \u00b1 0.3 days in the PCIS group (P = .0001). There were no periprocedural deaths in the PCIS group; there were four deaths in the ABF group (P = .058). In the PCIS group, ankle-brachial index increased from 0.66 to 0.89, and in the ABF group, ankle-brachial index increased from 0.54 to 0.98 (both groups, P < .001).\nThis study demonstrates that PCIS remains a suitable, less invasive first-line therapy for iliac artery occlusions. PCIS has lower morbidity, shorter hospital length of stay, and equivalent secondary patency but inferior primary patency compared with ABF.",

    "abstract": "Certain races are known to be at increased risk for stroke, and the prevalence of carotid artery stenosis (CAS) is thought to vary by race. The goal of this report was to study the prevalence of CAS in different races by analyzing a population of subjects who underwent vascular screening examinations.\nThe study data were provided by Life Line Screening. The cohort consists of self-referred individuals who paid for vascular screening tests. Subjects\u00a0<40 and >100 years of age and those who reported a prior stroke or carotid artery intervention were excluded. Of the remaining 3,291,382 subjects, 3.7% did not self-identify a race. CAS was defined as stenosis in either internal carotid artery \u226550% by duplex ultrasound velocity criteria.\nThe 3,291,382 subjects available for analysis consisted of Caucasian (2,845,936 [90%]), African American (97,502 [3.1%]), Hispanic (75,240 [2.4%]), Asian (60,982 [1.9%]), and Native American (87,757 [2.8%]) individuals. The prevalence of CAS was 3.4% in females and 4.2% in males (P \u2264 .001). Controlling for gender and age, there was marked variation in the prevalence of CAS (P\u00a0< .001) by race. Native American subjects had the highest prevalence of CAS across all age categories and in both sexes. Caucasian subjects had the second highest prevalence of CAS across most age decades and in both sexes. Among males, African American individuals had the lowest prevalence of CAS in nearly all age categories. In contrast to males, Asian females had the lowest prevalence of CAS compared with females of other races in most age groups. Multivariate analysis adjusting for atherosclerotic risk factors in addition to age confirmed race as a significant independent predictor of CAS. Compared with Caucasian subjects, African American (odds ratio [OR], 0.65), Asian (OR, 0.69), and Hispanic (OR, 0.74) subjects had a significantly lower risk of CAS, whereas Native American (OR, 1.3) subjects had a significantly higher risk of CAS.\nThe prevalence of clinically significant CAS varies significantly by race. Native American and Caucasian individuals have the highest prevalence of CAS, whereas African American males and Asian females appear to have the lowest prevalence. This information adds evidence to the hypothesis that the increased stroke rate in African American subjects is likely not related to extracranial cerebrovascular disease. Furthermore, this is a novel report of an extremely high prevalence of CAS in the Native American population.",

The prevalence of CAS was 3.4% in females and 4.2% in males (P \u2264 .001). Controlling for gender and age, there was marked variation in the prevalence of CAS (P\u00a0< .001) by race. Native American subjects had the highest prevalence of CAS across all age categories and in both sexes. Caucasian subjects had the second highest prevalence of CAS across most age decades and in both sexes. Among males, African American individuals had the lowest prevalence of CAS in nearly all age categories. In contrast to males, Asian females had the lowest prevalence of CAS compared with females of other races in most age groups. Multivariate analysis adjusting for atherosclerotic risk factors in addition to age confirmed race as a significant independent predictor of CAS. Compared with Caucasian subjects, African American (odds ratio [OR], 0.65), Asian (OR, 0.69), and Hispanic (OR, 0.74) subjects had a significantly lower risk of CAS, whereas Native American (OR, 1.3) subjects had a significantly higher risk of CAS.",

    "abstract": "Reintervention rates after repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are higher for endovascular repair (EVAR) than for open repair, mostly due to treatment for endoleaks, whereas open surgical operations for bowel obstruction and abdominal hernias are higher after open repair. However, readmission rates after EVAR or open repair for nonoperative conditions and complications that do not require an intervention are not well documented. We sought to determine reasons for all-cause readmissions within the first year after open repair and EVAR.\nPatients who underwent elective AAA repair in California during a 6-year period were identified from the Health Care and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database. All patients who had a readmission in California \u22641 year of their index procedure were included for evaluation. Readmission rates and primary and secondary diagnoses associated with each readmission were analyzed and recorded.\nFrom 2003 to 2008, there were 15,736 operations for elective AAA repair, comprising 9356 EVARs (60%) and 6380 open repairs (40%). At 1 year postoperatively, the readmission rate was 52.1% after open repair and 55.4% after EVAR (P=.0003). The three most common principle diagnoses associated with readmission after any type of AAA repair were failure to thrive, cardiac issues, and infection. When stratified by repair type, patients who underwent open repair were more likely to be readmitted with primary diagnoses associated with failure to thrive, cardiac complications, and infection compared with EVAR (all P<.001). Those who underwent EVAR were more likely, however, to be readmitted with primary diagnoses of device-related complications (P=.05), cardiac complications, and infection.\nTotal readmission rates within 1 year after elective AAA repair are greater after EVAR than after open repair. Reasons for readmission vary between the two cohorts but are related to the magnitude of open surgery after open repair, device issues after EVAR, and the usual cardiac and infectious complications after either intervention. Systems-based analysis of these causes of readmission can potentially improve patient expectations and care after elective aneurysm repair.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair is being used increasingly to treat ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAAs). Approximately 25% of RAAAs undergo complete circulatory collapse before or during the procedure. Patient survival depends on obtaining and maintaining supraceliac balloon control until the endograft is fully deployed. This is accomplished with a sheath-supported compliant balloon inserted via the groin contralateral to the side to be used for insertion of the endograft main body. After the main body is fully deployed, a second balloon is placed within the endograft, and the first balloon is removed so that extension limbs can be placed in the contralateral side. A third balloon can be placed via the contralateral side and ipsilateral extensions deployed as necessary. This technique of supraceliac balloon control is important to achieving good outcomes with RAAAs. In addition to minimizing blood loss, this technique minimizes visceral ischemia and maintains aortic control until the aneurysm rupture site is fully excluded.",

    "abstract": "Endografts represent a relatively new treatment modality for occlusive disease of the superficial femoral artery, with promising results. However, endografts may occlude collateral arteries, which may affect outcome in case of failure. The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical outcome of failed endografts in patients with superficial femoral artery occlusive disease.\nAll patients treated with one or more polytetrafluorethylene-covered stents between November 2001 and December 2011 were prospectively included in a database. Patients with a failure of the endograft were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical and hemodynamic parameters were assessed before the initial procedure and at the time of failure. Outcome of secondary procedures was analyzed.\nAmong the 341 patients who were treated during the study period, 49 (14.4%) failed during follow-up. Mean (standard deviation) Rutherford category at failure did not differ from the category as scored before the initial procedure (3.1 [1.3] vs 3.3 [0.6]; P\u00a0= .33). Forty-three percent of patients (n\u00a0= 21) presented with the same Rutherford category as before the initial procedure, 37% (n\u00a0= 18) with an improved category, and 20% (n\u00a0= 10) with a deteriorated category. The ankle-brachial index was significantly lower at the time of failure (0.66 [0.19] vs 0.45 [0.19[; P <.002). Seventy-six percent of patients with a failure needed secondary surgery, of which 25% were below knee. The 1-year primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency rates of secondary bypasses were 55.1%, 62.3%, and 77.7%, respectively. The amputation rate was 4.1% (n\u00a0= 2).\nFailure of endografts is not associated with a deterioration in clinical state and is related to a low amputation rate. The hypothesis that covered stents do not affect options for secondary reconstructions could not be confirmed, as 25% of patients with a failure underwent a below-knee bypass. Secondary surgical bypasses are correlated with poor patency. The amputation rate after failure is low.",

    "abstract": "The latest guidelines recommend performance of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on asymptomatic patients with high-grade carotid stenosis, only if the combined perioperative stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), or death risk is \u22643%. Our objective was to develop and validate a risk index to estimate the combined risk of perioperative stroke, MI, or death in asymptomatic patients undergoing elective CEA.\nAsymptomatic patients who underwent an elective CEA (n\u00a0= 17,692) were identified from the 2005-2010 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, a multicenter, prospective database. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed with primary outcome of interest being the composite of any stroke, MI, or death during the 30-day periprocedural period. Bootstrapping was used for internal validation. A risk index was created by assigning weighted points to each predictor using the \u03b2-coefficients from the regression analysis.\nFifty-eight percent of the patients were men with a median age of 72 years. Thirty-day incidences of stroke, MI, and death were 0.9% (n\u00a0= 167), 0.6% (n\u00a0= 108), and 0.4% (n\u00a0= 72), respectively. The combined 30-day stroke, MI, or death incidence was 1.8% (n\u00a0= 324). On multivariable analysis, six independent predictors were identified and a risk index created by assigning weighted points to each predictor using the \u03b2-coefficients from the regression analysis. The predictors included age in years (<60: 0 point; 60-69: -1 point; 70-79: -1 point; \u226580: 2 points), dyspnea (2 points), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (3 points), previous peripheral revascularization or amputation (3 points), recent angina within 1 month (4 points), and dependent functional status (5 points). Patients were classified as low (<3%),\u00a0intermediate (3%-6%), or high (>6%) risk for combined 30-day stroke, MI, or death, based on a total point score of\u00a0<4, 4-7, and >7, respectively. There were 15,249 patients (86.2%) in the low-risk category, 2233 (12.6%) in the intermediate-risk category, and 210 (1.2%) in the high-risk category.\nThe validated risk index can help identify asymptomatic patients who are at greatest risk for 30-day stroke, MI, and death after CEA, thereby aiding patient selection.",

    "abstract": "Combined superficial femoral artery (SFA) and tibial angioplasty (TA) are a common treatment for critical limb ischemia. Poor tibial runoff significantly compromises durability and clinical effectiveness of SFA interventions. The aim of this study is to determine clinical and anatomic outcomes of SFA interventions in patients with equally compromised runoff, with and without concomitant TA.\nThe database of patients undergoing endovascular treatment of SFA (1999-2009) was retrospectively queried. Patients with poor runoff, scored>10 by modified Society for Vascular Surgery criteria, were selected. Preoperative angiograms were reviewed to assess distal popliteal and tibial runoff. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to assess time-dependent outcomes. Factor analyses were performed for time-dependent variables.\nA total of 162 limbs with a runoff score>10 (56% men; average age, 69 years) underwent endovascular intervention for symptomatic SFA disease: 61 (54% men) underwent TA but the remaining 101 (57% men) did not. The groups were matched for age, sex, and SFA anatomy (Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus II C/D lesions: 56% no TA vs 62% TA; P=.5). Presenting symptoms were similar between no TA and TA groups (rest pain: 40% vs 32%; tissue loss: 60% vs 68%; P=.3). Three-year survival favored the TA group (79%\u00b15%) vs no TA (68%\u00b15%; P=.06). Three-year anatomic outcomes in no TA vs TA group, including primary patency (45%\u00b16% vs 63%\u00b18%; P=.04), assisted primary patency (55%\u00b16% vs 75%\u00b17%; P=.03), and secondary patency (57%\u00b16% vs 77%\u00b17%; P=.03) were all superior in the TA group. Target vessel revascularization in no TA vs TA (61%\u00b16% vs 74%\u00b18%; P=.002) and target extremity revascularization (42%\u00b16% vs 59%\u00b18%; P=.06) also favored the TA group. However the comparison of no TA vs TA for clinical success (39%\u00b16% vs 47%\u00b18%; P=.6), freedom from recurrent symptoms (59%\u00b16% vs 60%\u00b19%; P=.1), amputation-free survival (46%\u00b15% vs 63%\u00b17%; P=.06), and limb salvage at 3 years (63%\u00b16% vs 74%\u00b17%; P=.6) were similar.\nTA in patients with poor runoff has a positive effect on SFA anatomic outcomes. However, clinical success was not affected. Concomitant TA appears not to add clinical benefit to SFA intervention in critical limb ischemia.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of primary balloon angioplasty (PBA) of cephalic veins with diameter\u22642 mm on patency and maturation time of autogenous radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) for hemodialysis.\nForty patients, all candidates for distal AVF, with a cephalic vein\u22642 mm, were randomized to two different surgical procedures: (1) PBA of a long segment of the cephalic vein from the wrist up to the elbow (n=19); and (2) hydrostatic dilatation (HD) of a short venous segment (5 cm) at the level of the anastomosis (n=21). PBA was performed using a standard balloon 4\u00d7150 mm. Primary end points were primary patency and reintervention rates. Secondary end points were maturation time and the rate of working AVF. Follow-up included physical and duplex ultrasound (DUS) examinations at 1,4, and 8 weeks, and every 3 months thereafter.\nRisk factors were homogeneously distributed between the two groups. Mean vein diameter was 1.8\u00b10.2 mm for the PBA group and 1.7\u00b10.2 mm for HD. Immediate success rate was 100% for PBA and 67% for HD groups (P=.04). Causes of failure in the HD group included early vein thrombosis in seven patients (33%). Mean fistula maturation time was 32 days in the PBA group and 55 days in the HD group (P=.04). During the mean follow-up of 7 months, three patients underwent drug-eluting balloon angioplasty for failure of AVF to mature due to stenosis (1 in the PBA group and 2 in the HD group). Six-month reintervention rate was significantly lower in the PBA group (5%) compared with the HD group (43%) (P=.02). At 6 months, primary patency rates were 95% in the PBA group and 57% in the HD group (P=.01). Working AVF rate was 100% in the PBA vs 90% in the HD group.\nPBA of very small cephalic veins during the creation of a distal AVF for hemodialysis is a safe and feasible procedure. This technique assures excellent primary patency, maturation time, and dramatically decreases reintervention rate.",

    "abstract": "Clinical pathways aimed at reducing hospital length of stay following vascular surgery have been broadly implemented to reduce costs. However, early hospital discharge may adversely affect the risk of readmission or mortality. To address this question, we examined the relationship between early discharge and 30-day outcomes among patients undergoing a high-risk vascular surgery procedure, thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) repair.\nUsing Medicare claims from 2000 to 2007, we identified all patients who were discharged home following elective thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) and open repair for nonruptured TAAs. For each procedure, we examined the correlation between early discharge (<3 days for TEVAR, <7 days for open TAA repair) and 30-day readmission, 30-day mortality, and hospital costs. Predictors of readmission were evaluated using logistic regression models controlling for patient comorbidities, perioperative complications, and discharge location.\nOur sample included 9764 patients, of which 7850 (80%) underwent open TAA repair, and 1914 (20%) underwent TEVAR. Patients discharged to home early were more likely to be female (66% early vs 56% late), Caucasian (94% early vs 91% late), younger (73 years early vs 74 years late), and have fewer comorbidities (mean Charlson score: 0.7 early vs 1.0 late) than patients discharged home late (all P < .01). As compared with patients who were discharged late, patients discharged home early following uncomplicated open TAA repair and TEVAR had significantly lower 30-day readmission rates ([open: 17% vs 24%; P < .001] [TEVAR: 12% vs 23%; P < .001]) and hospital costs ([open: $73,061 vs $136,480; P < .001] [TEVAR: $58,667 vs $128,478; P < .001]), without an observed increase in 30-day postdischarge mortality. In multivariable analysis, early hospital discharge was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of readmission following both open TAA repair (odds ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.85; P < .001) and TEVAR (odds ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.85; P < .01) procedures.\nDischarging patients home early following uncomplicated TEVAR or open TAA repair is associated with reduced hospital costs without adversely impacting 30-day readmission or mortality rates. These data support the safety and cost-effectiveness of programs aimed at early hospital discharge in selected vascular surgery patients.",

    "abstract": "Lower extremity peripheral artery disease occurs mostly in the elderly and is associated with high mortality. Limited data are available regarding long-term mortality in patients with premature lower extremity atherosclerosis (PLEA). Our objective was to determine the all-cause mortality and its predictors in younger PLEA patients.\nWe studied patients with severe PLEA who were <55 years of age at diagnosis and treated at a single academic vascular center between 1998 and 2010. Data were collected prospectively at the initial evaluation for vascular care. National Death Index and hospital records were used to determine all-cause mortality. Demographic and clinical characteristics were summarized using count (%), mean (standard deviation), or median (interquartile range), and associations with aspirin use were tested using \u03c72 test, t-test, or Wilcoxon test. Survival times were estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and associations with covariates were tested using simple and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.\nA total of 564 patients were analyzed (46% female; 20% nonwhite; mean age 49.4 [6.4] years). Ninety-five percent of patients had \u22652 cardiovascular risk factors, 31% had coronary artery disease (CAD), and 10% had a history of cancer. During median follow-up of 5.6 years (interquartile range, 2.3-8.3 years), 108 deaths (19%) were recorded. Two-year estimated mortality (standard error) was 6% (0.01), and 5-year estimated mortality was 16% (0.02). In univariate regression analysis, patient age (P=.04), prior amputation (P<.01), history of cancer (P=.03), and established CAD (P=.04) were associated with increased risk of mortality. Aspirin use and lipid-lowering therapy at the time of first evaluation were associated with improved survival (P<.01 and P=.02, respectively). A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model identified age (hazard ratio [HR] for 5-year increase, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.36; P=.04), prior amputation (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.18-3.34; P=.01), history of cancer (HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.36-4.07; P<.01), and CAD (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.16-2.67; P<.01) as independent predictors of mortality in patients with PLEA. Importantly, history of aspirin use had a significant protective effect (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.30-0.69; P<.01). The impact of lipid-lowering therapy was no longer significant in multivariable modeling.\nPatients with PLEA demonstrate high all-cause mortality. No traditional cardiovascular risk factors predicted mortality. Aspirin therapy at the time of first evaluation was a significant and independent predictor of improved survival in patients with PLEA.",

    "abstract": "Vascular surgery is a subspecialty that attracts future surgeons with challenging technical procedures and complex decision making. Despite its appeal, continued promotion of the field is necessary to recruit and retain the best and brightest candidates. Recruitment of medical students and residents may be limited by the lifestyle inherent to vascular surgery and the length of residency training. The young adults of the current applicant and resident pool differ from prior generations in their desire for hands-on mentoring, aspirations to affect change daily, a penchant for technology, and strong emphasis on work-life balance. Furthermore, the percentage of women pursuing careers in vascular surgery is not representative of the eligible workforce. Women are now the majority of graduates in all of higher education, and thus, vascular surgery may need to make a concerted effort to appeal to women in order to attract the most talented young professionals to the field. Recruiting strategies for both men and women of Generation Y should target a diverse group of potential candidates with an awareness of the unique characteristics and needs of this generation of rising surgeons.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophils have been shown to be involved in all stages of human and experimental abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development. The initial processes of neutrophil rolling and trapping in the intraluminal thrombus (ILT) are mediated mainly by P-selectin expressed by activated platelets. In the present study, we propose to evaluate the beneficial effect of fucoidan, a competitive binding agent of P-selectin, on aneurysmal growth in a rat model of aortic aneurysm with neutrophil enrichment of the ILT induced by repeated episodes of weak bacteremia.\nSixty Lewis rats with experimental AAAs, developed from decellularized aortic xenografts, were divided into four groups. Two groups were used as controls: group fucoidan control (FC) was treated with 200 mg of fucoidan (F) delivered by 2 mL, 4-week osmotic pumps placed intraperitoneally before closing the abdomen, and group C received saline instead of fucoidan. Two more groups were injected weekly with Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis [Pg]): group F+Pg received 200 mg of intraperitoneal fucoidan and group Pg received saline. AAAs were harvested after 4 weeks and peripheral blood was sampled at that time. Cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) and myeloperoxydase (MPO) antigen concentrations were determined in plasma and in AAA-conditioned media. Histology and P-selectin immunostaining were performed on AAA tissue samples.\nComparing rats injected with Pg, those receiving fucoidan presented reduced aneurysmal diameter. Histologic analysis of AAAs showed that fucoidan reduced the ILT thickness in Pg-injected rats, with fewer trapped neutrophils, and with signs of a healing process, as observed in control group C. Immunohistological analysis revealed a substantial decrease in P-selectin immunostaining at the luminal surface of aneurysms in fucoidan-treated rats compared to the other groups, suggesting an interaction between fucoidan and P-selectin. A significant decrease in MPO concentrations in both plasma and conditioned medium was induced by fucoidan treatment in Pg-injected rats, reflecting a pacification of the ILT biological activity. This effect was associated with a reduction in neutrophil activation and apoptosis, reflected by a significant decrease in cf-DNA concentration in both plasma and conditioned medium of fucoidan-treated rats.\nOur results suggest that fucoidan has a beneficial effect on experimental aneurysmal degeneration by decreasing neutrophil activation in the ILT enhanced by weak pathogen contamination. This effect seems to be related to its interaction with P-selectin, which may decrease the trapping of neutrophils into the ILT. Fucoidan could represent a therapeutic option in AAAs to decrease the neutrophil activation involved in the degenerative process of aneurysmal expansion and rupture.",

    "abstract": "The right and left sides of the brain play different roles in cognition. Therefore, the side of treatment should be taken into consideration when evaluating cognitive outcome following revascularization. Thus, we designed a study to evaluate changes in right hemisphere cognitive function in patients undergoing right carotid artery stentings (CAS) and left hemispheric cognitive function in patients undergoing left CAS. In addition, we studied CAS-related changes in regional cerebral blood flow to determine potential correlations with changes in cognitive function.\nWe performed a prospective assessment of 39 CAS patients, all of whom were right-handed. Patients with contralateral stenotic lesions were excluded. Twenty-one patients underwent CAS of the right internal carotid artery (Right CAS group) and 18 underwent CAS of the left internal carotid artery (Left CAS group). Neuropsychological testing was performed preoperatively and 6 months after endovascular treatment. Cerebral blood flow was determined by 123I-labeled N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography before and 6 months after CAS.\nIn the Right CAS group, postoperative performance intelligence quotient score (91.1\u00b118.2) was significantly improved compared with the preoperative score (84.9\u00b116.7; P<.001). In the Left CAS group, postoperative verbal intelligence quotient score (104.0\u00b118.8) was significantly higher than that before endovascular treatment (97.9\u00b115.8; P<.005). Postoperative regional cerebral blood flow was not significantly different from that before endovascular treatment in either group. However, regional cerebrovascular reactivity of the treated side showed significant improvement after treatment.\nAmelioration of cognitive function may be dependent on the side of revascularization. Performance intelligence quotient improved after CAS in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis on the right side. Verbal intelligence quotient also improved on the left side after endovascular treatment. These effects seemed to involve improvement in regional cerebrovascular reactivity by CAS.",

    "abstract": "In 2007, Medicare guidelines were established to identify persons at risk for the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 5-year outcomes of an AAA screening program in a regional Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system.\nData were extracted from a regional VA health care network identifying all veteran males 65 to 75 years of age who smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime. In 2007, an AAA screening mandate was implemented allowing patients meeting screening criteria to be evaluated for AAA as part of the patient's health maintenance. AAA is identified as an aortic diameter size of 3.0 cm or greater. Clinician adherence to screening protocols and referral to a vascular surgeon for aneurysms >5.5 cm were also evaluated.\nA total of 9751 patients (71.5 \u00b1 5.6 standard deviation years of age) were screened for an AAA over a 5-year period from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011. A total of 698 aneurysms (7.1%) were found. Referrals to a vascular surgeon were made on 45 patients with aneurysms >5.5 cm. Over a 5-year period, a total of 2754 patients (28.2%) were inappropriately screened: 416 patients were under 65 years old, 2243 patients were over 75 years old, 36 patients were women, and 123 patients without aneurysms had multiple screenings. In 2007, during the first year of implementation, 39.2% of patients were inappropriately screened. Over the next 4 years, inappropriate screenings decreased with 33.7% in 2008, 28.6% in 2009, 17.7% in 2010, and 14.3% in 2011.\nA large AAA screening program at the VA detects more aneurysms, but at smaller diameters than that published in clinical trials. Over time, the number of inappropriate AAA screenings has continued to decrease, demonstrating greater awareness and application of the AAA screening guidelines by primary care providers. Developing surveillance guidelines for small and medium aneurysms is a potential area for future research.",

    "abstract": "Thermal ablative techniques of varicose veins carry a risk of heat-related complications, including postoperative pain. Mechanochemical endovenous ablation (MOCA) might avoid these complications and reduce postoperative pain because of the absence of thermal energy. This study evaluated postoperative pain and quality of life after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and MOCA for great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence.\nSixty-eight patients with unilateral GSV incompetence were treated with either RFA or MOCA in this prospective observational study. Patients monitored their pain for the first 14 postoperative days on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). They also completed the general (RAND 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) and disease-specific (Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire) quality of life questionnaires before and 6 weeks after treatment.\nPatients treated with MOCA reported significantly less postoperative pain than patients treated with RFA during the first 14 days after treatment (4.8 \u00b1 9.7 mm vs 18.6 \u00b1 17.0 mm; P < .001) (mean VAS over 14 days). The lower postoperative pain score was associated with a significantly earlier return to normal activities (1.2 \u00b1 1.8 vs 2.4 \u00b1 2.8 days; P = .02) and work resumption (3.3 \u00b1 4.7 vs 5.6 \u00b1 5.8 days, respectively; P = .02). At 6 weeks, patients in both groups perceived an improved change in health status and an improved disease-specific quality of life.\nMOCA is associated with significantly less postoperative pain, faster recovery, and earlier work resumption compared with RFA in the treatment of GSV incompetence. MOCA and RFA are both related to a rapid improvement in quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Aortic injury is the second most common cause of death after blunt trauma. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has been rapidly adopted as an alternative to the traditional open repair (OR) for treatment of traumatic aortic injury (TAI). This paradigm shift has improved the outcomes in these patients. This study evaluated the outcomes of TEVAR compared with OR for patients with TAI.\nWe analyzed prospectively collected data from the institutional trauma registry between April 2002 and June 2010. These data were supplemented with a retrospective review of hospital financial accounts. The primary outcome was the presence or absence of any complication, including in-hospital death. Secondary outcomes included fixed, variable, and total hospital costs and intensive care unit (ICU), preoperative, postoperative and total hospital length of stay (LOS).\nAmongst 106 consecutive patients (74 men; mean age, 36.4 years), 56 underwent OR and 50 underwent TEVAR for treatment of TAI. The proportion of patients who underwent TEVAR compared with OR increased from 0% to 100% during the study period. The TEVAR patients were significantly older than the OR patients (41.1 vs 32.2 years, P=.012). For patients who underwent TEVAR, the estimated odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of complications, including in-hospital mortality was 0.33 (0.11-0.97; P=.045) compared with the OR group. The average number of complications, including in-hospital death, was higher in the OR group than in the TEVAR group (adjusted means, 1.29 vs 0.94). The OR group had a higher proportion of patients with complications, including in-hospital death, compared with the TEVAR group (69.6% vs 48%). Although, the mean adjusted variable costs were higher for TEVAR than for OR (P=.017), the mean adjusted fixed and total costs were not significantly different. Owing to a policy of delayed selective management, the adjusted preoperative LOS was significantly higher for TEVAR (9.8 vs 3.0 days, P=.022). The difference in the ICU or total hospital LOS was not significant. Although the proportion of uninsured patients was similar in both groups, the cohort (n=106) had a significantly higher proportion of uninsured patients (29% vs 5%) compared with the general vascular surgical population at our institution (0.29 vs 0.051, 95% confidence interval for difference in proportions, 0.22-0.40; P<.0001).\nCompared with TEVAR, patients who underwent OR had three times higher odds to face a complication or in-hospital death. The mean total cost of TEVAR was not significantly different than OR. The findings support the use of TEVAR over OR for patients with TAI.",

    "abstract": "The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program ranks hospitals according to risk-adjusted rates of postoperative complications. However, this approach does not consider the severity or number of complications that occurred. We sought to determine whether incorporating this information would alter hospital rankings.\nThe study examined data for the 39,519 patients who underwent major vascular surgery in 206 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program hospitals during 2008 to 2009. We categorized postoperative complications as minor or severe and evaluated the extent to which minor and severe complications increased a patient's risk of death and prolonged length of stay. We then ranked hospitals on two alternative approaches that included severity or number of complications. We determined the effect of these alternative methods by assessing the proportion of hospitals that moved out of the top and bottom 20% of hospitals compared with standard rankings.\nCompared with patients with minor complications, patients with severe complications had a higher mortality rate (16.2% vs 3.6%; P<.001) and prolonged length of stay (66.7% vs 53.3%; P<.001). Patients with two or more complications also had a higher mortality rate (23.7% vs 6.0%; P<.001) and prolonged length of stay (77.0% vs 50.1%; P<.001) than patients with only one complication. Compared with the current approach for assessing morbidity, ranking hospitals by severe complications resulted in 12 hospitals (29%) moving out of the top 20% and 10 hospitals (24%) moving out of the bottom 20%. A similar degree of reclassification was found when the current rankings were compared with an alternative approach that considered the number of different complications.\nAlthough the severity and number of postoperative complications affect mortality and length of stay, and subsequently, hospital rankings, existing measurement systems do not take this into account. Quality measurement platforms should consider weighting complications according to severity and number.",

We investigated the mechanism of late distal SINE, prevention strategies, proper size selection of the stent graft, and implantation sequence.\nFrom November 2006 to May 2011, 99 patients with aortic dissection underwent TEVAR with Zenith TX2 stent grafts (Cook, Bloomington, Ind) at our center. Among them, 27 distal SINEs were recognized. Eight of these patients with complicated distal SINE required intervention with new distal endografts, and all were enrolled for further analysis.\nEight of the 27 patients with distal SINE underwent a secondary endograft procedure from February 2011 to July 2011. All were successfully treated without any complications or deaths. A high taper ratio (35%\u00b111%) and excessive oversizing of the true lumen area at the distal stent level (293%\u00b176%) were noted among these patients.\nThe incidence of distal SINE seemed to be high; however, there were also low rates of death and complications after TEVAR for aortic dissection using stainless steel-based stent grafts. Complicated distal SINE can successfully be resolved by distal endograft implantation. Excessive oversizing of the distal stent graft, as measured by the true lumen area, may be a significant factor causing delayed distal SINE. Precise size selection is crucial for the distal end of the stent, especially for high taper ratio dissection pathology in which the implantation sequence of a distal small-sized stent graft first might be considered to prevent future distal SINE.",

    "abstract": "Management and follow-up of chronic aortic dissections continue to be a clinical challenge due to progressive dilatation and subsequent rupture. To predict complications, guidelines suggest follow-up of aortic diameter. However, dilatation is triggered by hemodynamic parameters (pressures/wall shear stresses) and geometry of false (FL) and true lumen (TL), information not captured by diameter alone. Therefore, we aimed at better understanding the influence of dissection anatomy on TL and FL hemodynamics.\nIn vitro studies were performed using pulsatile flow in realistic dissected latex/silicone geometries with varying tear number, size, and location. We assessed three different conformations: (1) proximal tear only; (2) distal tear only; (3) both proximal and distal tears. All possible combinations (n = 8) of small (10% of aortic diameter) and large (25% of aortic diameter) tears were considered. Pressure, velocity, and flow patterns were analyzed within the lumina (at proximal and distal sections) and at the tears. We also computed the FL mean pressure index (FPI(mean)%) as a percentage of the TL mean pressure, to compare pressures among models.\nThe presence of large tears equalized FL/TL pressures compared with models with only small tears (proximal FPI(mean)% 99.85 \u00b1 0.45 vs 92.73 \u00b1 3.63; distal FPI(mean)% 99.51 \u00b1 0.80 vs 96.35 \u00b1 1.96; P < .001). Thus, large tears resulted in slower velocities through the tears (systolic velocity <180 cm/s) and complex flows within the FL, whereas small tears resulted in lower FL pressures, higher tear velocities (systolic velocity >290 cm/s), and a well-defined flow. Additionally, both proximal and distal tears act as entry and exit. During systole, flow enters the FL through all tears simultaneously, while during diastole, flow leaves through all communications. Flow through the FL, from proximal to distal tears or vice versa, is minimal.\nOur results suggest that FL hemodynamics heavily depends on cumulative tear size, and thus, it is an important parameter to take into account when clinically assessing chronic aortic dissections.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is associated with a prothrombotic diathesis that may increase the risk of cardiovascular events. This diathesis is exacerbated in the short term by open aneurysm repair (OAR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). However, the effect of EVAR and OAR on coagulation and fibrinolysis in the medium and long term is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the medium-term effects of EVAR and OAR on thrombin generation, neutralization, and fibrinolysis.\nProthrombin fragment (PF)1+2, thrombin antithrombin (TAT) complex, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity, and tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen were measured in eight age-matched controls (AMCs), 29 patients with AAA immediately before (preoperatively) and 12 months after EVAR (post-EVAR), and in 11 patients at a mean of 16 months after OAR (post-OAR).\nPreoperatively, PF1+2 levels were significantly higher in patients with AAAs than in AMC. PF1+2 levels post-EVAR and post-OAR were significantly lower than preoperative values and similar to AMC. There was no significant difference in TAT, PAI, or t-PA between AMC, AAA preoperatively, and post-EVAR. Post-OAR, PAI activity was significantly higher than in preoperative patients.\nAAA is associated with increased thrombin generation without upregulation of fibrinolysis. The prothrombotic, hypofibrinolytic diathesis observed in patients with AAA returns toward normal in the medium term after EVAR and OAR, although there is a trend toward decreased fibrinolysis post-OAR.",

Clinical characteristics were compared between 35 adolescent patients (aged<21 years) and 154 adults (aged>21 years). Functional outcome measures were assessed before surgery and at 3- and 6-month follow-up using a composite NTOS Index combining the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) survey, the Cervical-Brachial Symptom Questionnaire (CBSQ), and a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) for pain.\nAdolescent and adult patients were not significantly different with respect to sex (overall 72.5% female), side affected (58.7% right, 60.3% dominant limb), bony anomalies (23.3%), previous injury (55.6%), coexisting pain disorders (11.1%), and positive responses to scalene muscle anesthetic blocks (95.6%). Compared with adults, adolescent patients had a significantly (P<.05) lower incidence of depression (11.4% vs 41.6%), motor vehicle injury (5.7% vs 20.1%), previous operations (11.4% vs 29.9%), preoperative use of opiate medications (17.1% vs 44.8%), and symptom duration>2 years (24.2% vs 50.0%).

    "abstract": "An association of intraluminal thrombus (ILT) with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) growth has been suggested. Previous in vitro experiments have demonstrated that aneurysm-associated thrombus may secrete proteolytic enzymes and may develop local hypoxia that might lead to the formation of tissue-damaging reactive oxygen species. In this study, we assessed the hypothesis that ventral ILT thickness is associated with markers of proteolysis and with lipid oxidation in the underlying AAA vessel wall.\nVentral AAA tissue was collected from asymptomatic patients at the site of maximal diameter during open aneurysm repair. Segments were divided, one part for biochemical measurements and one for histologic analyses. We measured total cathepsin B, cathepsin S levels, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activity. Myeloperoxidase and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were determined as measures of lipid oxidation. Histologic segments were analyzed semiquantitatively for the presence of collagen, elastin, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and inflammatory cells. Preoperative computed tomography angiography scans of 83 consecutive patients were analyzed. A three-dimensional reconstruction was obtained, and a center lumen line of the aorta was constructed. Ventral ILT thickness was measured in the anteroposterior direction at the level of maximal aneurysm diameter on the orthogonal slices.\nVentral ILT thickness was positively correlated with aortic diameter (r=0.25; P=.02) and with MMP-2 levels (r=0.27; P=.02). No biochemical correlations were observed with MMP-9 activity or cathepsin B and S expression. No correlation between ventral ILT thickness and myeloperoxidase or thiobarbituric acid reactive substances was observed. Ventral ILT thickness was negatively correlated with VSMCs (no staining, 18.5 [interquartile range, 12.0-25.5] mm; minor, 17.6 [10.7-22.1] mm; moderate, 14.5 [4.6-21.7] mm; and heavy, 8.0 [0.0-12.3] mm, respectively; P=.01) and the amount of elastin (no staining, 18.6 [12.2-30.0] mm; minor, 16.5 [9.0-22.1] mm; moderate, 11.7 [2.5-15.3] mm; and heavy 7.7 [0.0-7.7] mm, respectively; P=.01) in the medial aortic layer.\nILT thickness appeared to be associated with VSMCs apoptosis and elastin degradation and was positively associated with MMP-2 concentrations in the underlying wall. This suggests that ILT thickness affects AAA wall stability and might contribute to AAA growth and rupture. ILT thickness was not correlated with markers of lipid oxidation.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous endovascular aneurysm repair (PEVAR) has been shown to be feasible; however, technical success is variable, reported to be between 46.2% and 100%. The objective of this study was to quantify the learning curve of the PEVAR closure technique and identify predictors of closure failure.\nWe reviewed patient- and procedure-related characteristics in 99 consecutive patients who underwent PEVAR over a 30-month period in a single academic institution. A suture-mediated closure device (Proglide or Prostar XL) was used. Forward stepwise logistic regression was used to investigate associations between the failure of the closure technique and a number of patient and operative characteristics. To ensure objective assessment of the learning curve, a time-dependent covariate measuring time in calendar quarters was introduced in the model. Poisson regression was used to model the trend of observed failure events of the percutaneous technique over time.\nOverall PEVAR technical success was 82%. Type of closure device (P<.35), patient's body mass index (P<.86), type of anesthesia (P<.95), femoral artery diameter (P<.09), femoral artery calcification (P<.56), and sheath size as measured in Fr (P<.17) did not correlate with closure failure rates. There was a strong trend for a decreasing number of failure events over time (P<.007). The average decrease in the odds of technical failure was 24% per calendar quarter. The predicted probability of closure failure decreased from 45% per patient at the time of the initiation of our PEVAR program to 5% per patient at the end of the 30-month period. There were two postoperative access-related complications that required surgical repair. Need for surgical cutdown in the event of closure failure prolonged the operative time by a mean of 45 minutes (P<.001). No groin infections were seen in the percutaneous group or the failed group.\nTechnical failure can be reduced as the surgeon gains experience with the suture-mediated closure device utilized during PEVAR. Previous experience with the Proglide device does not seem to influence the learning curve.",

    "abstract": "Repair of saccular aortic aneurysms (SAAs) is frequently recommended based on a perceived predisposition to rupture, despite little evidence that these aneurysms have a more malignant natural history than fusiform aortic aneurysms.\nThe radiology database at a single university hospital was searched for the computed tomographic (CT) diagnosis of SAA between 2003 and 2011. Patient characteristics and clinical course, including the need for surgical intervention, were recorded. SAA evolution was assessed by follow-up CT, where available. Multivariate analysis was used to examine potential predictors of aneurysm growth rate.\nThree hundred twenty-two saccular aortic aneurysms were identified in 284 patients. There were 153 (53.7%) men and 131 women with a mean age of 73.5\u00b110.0 years. SAAs were located in the ascending aorta in two (0.6%) cases, the aortic arch in 23 (7.1%), the descending thoracic aorta in 219 (68.1%), and the abdominal aorta in 78 (24.2%). One hundred thirteen (39.8%) patients underwent surgical repair of SAA. Sixty-two patients (54.9%) underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair, 22 underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (19.5%), and 29 (25.6%) required open surgery. The average maximum diameter of SAA was 5.0\u00b11.6 cm. In repaired aneurysms, the mean diameter was 5.4\u00b11.4 cm; in unrepaired aneurysms, it was 4.4\u00b11.1 cm (P<.001). Eleven patients (3.9%) had ruptured SAAs on initial scan. Of the initial 284 patients, 50 patients (with 54 SAA) had CT follow-up after at least 3 months (23.2\u00b119.0 months). Fifteen patients (30.0%) ultimately underwent surgical intervention. Aneurysm growth rate was 2.8\u00b12.9 mm/yr, and was only weakly related to initial aortic diameter (R2=.19 by linear regression, P=.09 by multivariate regression). Decreased calcium burden (P=.03) and increased patient age (P=.05) predicted increased aneurysm growth by multivariate analysis.\nWhile SAA were not found to have a higher growth rate than their fusiform counterparts, both clinical and radiologic follow-up is necessary, as a significant number ultimately require surgical intervention. Further clinical research is necessary to determine the optimal management of SAA.",

    "abstract": "Intimal hyperplasia (IH) is the main cause of vein graft stenosis or failure after bypass surgery. Basic investigations are proceeding in an animal model of mechanically desquamated arteries, and numerous molecules for potential IH treatments have been identified; however, neither insights into the mechanism of IH nor substantially effective treatments for its suppression have been developed. The goals of the present study are to use human vein graft samples to identify therapeutic target genes that control IH and to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of these candidate molecules in animal models.\nUsing microarray analysis of human vein graft samples, we identified two previously unrecognized IH-related genes, mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPKAPK3) and four-and-a-half LIM domains 5 (FHL5).\nTransfer of either candidate gene resulted in significantly elevated vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration. Interestingly, cotransfection of both genes increased VSMC proliferation in an additive manner. These genes activated cyclic adenosine monophosphate response-element (CRE) binding protein (CREB), but their mechanisms of activation were different. MAPKAPK3 phosphorylated CREB, but FHL5 bound directly to CREB. A CREB dominant-negative protein, KCREB, which blocks its ability to bind CRE, repressed VSMC proliferation and migration. In a wire-injury mouse model, gene transfer of KCREB plasmid significantly repressed IH. In this vessel tissue, CRE-activated gene expression was repressed. Furthermore, we confirmed the changes in MAPKAPK3 and FHL5 expression using vein graft samples from eight patients.\nWe successively identified two previously unrecognized IH activators, MAPKAPK3 and FHL5, using human vein graft samples. Gene transfer of KCREB repressed IH in an animal model. Inhibition of CREB function is a promising gene therapy strategy for IH.",

    "abstract": "Innate immunity drives numerous cardiovascular pathologies. Vein bypass grafting procedures are frequently accompanied by low-grade wound contamination. We hypothesized that a peri-graft innate immune challenge, via an outside-in route, augments inflammatory responses, which subsequently drive a component of negative vein graft wall adaptations; moreover, adipose tissue mediates this immune response.\nThe inferior vena cava from a donor mouse was implanted into the common carotid artery of a recipient mouse utilizing a validated cuff technique (9-week-old male C57BL/6J mice). Slow-release low-dose (5 \u03bcg) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (n = 9) or vehicle (n = 9) was applied peri-graft; morphologic analysis was completed (day 28). In parallel, vein-grafted mice received peri-graft LPS (n = 12), distant subcutaneous LPS (n = 6), or vehicle (n = 12), then day-1 and -3 harvest of grafts and adipose tissue for cytokines and toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling mRNA expression (qRT-PCR).\nAll recipient mice survived, and all vein grafts were patent. Acute low-dose local LPS challenge enhanced vein graft lumen loss (P = .04) and tended to augment intimal hyperplasia (P = .06). The surgical trauma of vein grafting universally upregulated key pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators within the day-1 graft wall, but varied on TLR signaling gene expression. Local and distant LPS accentuated these patterns until at least postoperative day 3. LPS challenge enhanced the inflammatory response in adipose tissue (locally > distantly); local LPS upregulated adipose TLR-4 dramatically.\nPerivascular and distant inflammatory challenges potentiate the magnitude and duration of inflammatory responses in the early vein graft wall, negatively modulating wall adaptations, and thus, potentially contribute to vein graft failure. Furthermore, surgery activates innate immunity in adipose tissue, which is augmented (regionally > systemically) by LPS. Modulation of these local and distant inflammatory signaling networks stands as a potential strategy to enhance the durability of vascular interventions such as vein grafts.",

    "abstract": "To examine the relationship between early renal duplex sonography (RDS) and restenosis after primary renal artery percutaneous angioplasty and stenting (RA-PTAS).\nConsecutive patients undergoing RA-PTAS for hemodynamically significant atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis with hypertension and/or ischemic nephropathy between September 2003 and July 2010 were identified from a prospective registry. Patients had renal RDS pre-RA-PTAS, within 1 week of RA-PTAS and follow-up RDS examinations after the first postoperative week for surveillance of restenosis. Restenosis was defined as a renal artery peak systolic velocity (PSV) \u2265 180 cm/s on follow-up RDS. Associations between RDS and restenosis were examined using proportional hazards regression.\nEighty-three patients (59% female; 12% nonwhite; mean age, 70 \u00b1 10 years; mean pre-RA-PTAS PSV, 276 \u00b1 107 cm/s) undergoing 91 RA-PTAS procedures comprised the sample for this study. All procedures included a completion arteriogram demonstrating no significant residual stenosis. Mean follow-up time was 14.9 \u00b1 10.8 months. Thirty-four renal arteries (RAs) demonstrated restenosis on follow-up with a median time to restenosis of 8.7 months. There was no significant difference in the mean PSV pre-RA-PTAS in those with and without restenosis (287 \u00b1 96 cm/s vs 269 \u00b1 113 cm/s; P = .455), and PSV pre-RA-PTAS was not predictive of restenosis. Within 1 week of RA-PTAS, mean renal artery PSV differed significantly for renal arteries with and without restenosis (112 \u00b1 27 cm/s vs 91 \u00b1 34 cm/s; P = .003). Proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated increased PSV on first post-RA-PTAS RDS was significantly and independently associated with subsequent restenosis during follow-up (hazard ratio for 30 cm/s increase, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-2.49; P = .0003). There was no difference in pre- minus postprocedural PSV in those with and without restenosis on follow-up (175 \u00b1 104 cm/s vs 179 \u00b1 124 cm/s; P = .88), nor was this associated with time to restenosis. Best subsets model selection identified first postprocedural RDS as the only factor predictive of follow-up restenosis. A receiver-operating characteristic curve was examined to assess the first week PSV post-RA-PTAS most predictive of restenosis during follow-up. The ideal cut point for RA-PSV was 87 cm/s or greater. This value was associated with a sensitivity of 82.4%, specificity of 52.6%, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 69.3%. Increased first postprocedural RA-PSV was predictive of lower estimated glomerular filtration rate in the first 2 years after the procedure (-1.6 \u00b1 0.7 mL/min/1.73 m(2) lower estimated glomerular filtration rate per 10 cm/s increase in RA-PSV; P = .010).\nEarly renal artery PSV within 1 week after RA-PTAS predicted renal artery restenosis and lower postprocedure renal function. Recurrent stenosis demonstrated no association with absolute elevation in PSV prior to RA-PTAS nor with the change in PSV after RA-PTAS. These data suggest that detectable differences exist in renal artery flow parameters following RA-PTAS that are predictive of restenosis during follow-up but are not apparent on completion arteriography or detectable by intra-arterial pressure measurements. Further study is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there are no well-established duplex ultrasound (DUS) criteria for the evaluation of the mesenteric arteries after stenting for occlusive disease. Previous studies suggested DUS velocity criteria in the native superior mesenteric artery (SMA) overestimate stenosis in stented arteries, but most studies have not evaluated DUS imaging after SMA stenting longitudinally. This study was undertaken to determine the accuracy of DUS after mesenteric artery revascularization and, in particular, to evaluate the utility of DUS imaging for the detection of in-stent stenosis (ISS) of the SMA.\nA retrospective record review was performed for all patients who underwent SMA stenting for chronic mesenteric ischemia at a single institution from January 2004 to May 2011.\nMesenteric artery occlusive disease resulted in 24 patients undergoing mesenteric stenting of the SMA alone (n = 20) or the SMA and celiac artery simultaneously (n = 3). The mean \u00b1 standard deviation peak systolic velocity (PSV) in 13 prestent DUS images of the SMA was 464 \u00b1 130 cm/s. Prestenting angiography revealed an average SMA stenosis of 79% \u00b1 14%. After stenting, completion angiography in each case revealed <20% residual stenosis. No significant correlation was identified between SMA PSV and angiographic stenosis before and after stenting (P > .05). Follow-up SMA DUS imaging showed an average PSV of 335 \u00b1 138 cm/s at 0.9 \u00b1 1.5 months, 360 \u00b1 143 cm/s at 4.8 \u00b12.6 months, and 389 \u00b1 95 cm/s at 14.4 \u00b1 5.1 months. A significant difference existed between the prestent and the first poststent mean SMA PSV (P < .05), but no significant difference existed between each poststenting interval. Eight reinterventions for SMA ISS were performed, with a mean elevated in-stent SMA PSV of 505 \u00b1 74 vs 341 \u00b1 145 cm/s in patients who did not undergo reintervention. Angiography before the eight reinterventions demonstrated an average SMA ISS of 53% \u00b1 25%. In-stent SMA PSV decreased from 505 \u00b1 74 to 398 \u00b1 108 cm/s after the reintervention (P < .05).\nConsistent with other reports, our data demonstrate the PSV in successfully stented SMAs remains higher than the PSV threshold of 275 cm/s used for the diagnosis of high-grade native SMA stenosis. In addition, in-stent SMA PSVs did not significantly change over DUS surveillance for patients who did not undergo reintervention. Thus, obtaining a baseline DUS early after mesenteric stenting should be considered to compare future surveillance DUS. An increase above this baseline or an in-stent SMA PSV approaching 500 cm/s should be considered suspicious for ISS, but larger prospective studies will be required to validate these preliminary findings.",

    "results": "Mesenteric artery occlusive disease resulted in 24 patients undergoing mesenteric stenting of the SMA alone (n = 20) or the SMA and celiac artery simultaneously (n = 3). The mean \u00b1 standard deviation peak systolic velocity (PSV) in 13 prestent DUS images of the SMA was 464 \u00b1 130 cm/s. Prestenting angiography revealed an average SMA stenosis of 79% \u00b1 14%. After stenting, completion angiography in each case revealed <20% residual stenosis. No significant correlation was identified between SMA PSV and angiographic stenosis before and after stenting (P > .05). Follow-up SMA DUS imaging showed an average PSV of 335 \u00b1 138 cm/s at 0.9 \u00b1 1.5 months, 360 \u00b1 143 cm/s at 4.8 \u00b12.6 months, and 389 \u00b1 95 cm/s at 14.4 \u00b1 5.1 months. A significant difference existed between the prestent and the first poststent mean SMA PSV (P < .05), but no significant difference existed between each poststenting interval. Eight reinterventions for SMA ISS were performed, with a mean elevated in-stent SMA PSV of 505 \u00b1 74 vs 341 \u00b1 145 cm/s in patients who did not undergo reintervention. Angiography before the eight reinterventions demonstrated an average SMA ISS of 53% \u00b1 25%. In-stent SMA PSV decreased from 505 \u00b1 74 to 398 \u00b1 108 cm/s after the reintervention (P < .05).",

    "abstract": "Vascular malformations are a rare and complex group of lesions which may present serious pitfalls in diagnosis and management. We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of our imaging protocol and therapeutic algorithm in the treatment of low-flow and high-flow vascular malformations in a large series of patients.\nA prospective database of all patients treated by the multidisciplinary vascular malformation team at our institution between 2006 and 2011 was reviewed. Management decisions were based on patients' clinical profile as well as critical lesion characteristics, and included conservative care, sclerotherapy, embolization, surgical resection, or a combination of these modalities. Treatment goals and expectations were established by the patient and physician at the time of initial evaluation. An outcomes grading system based on patient- and physician-derived treatment goals and assessment of response to management was applied (1 = worse; 2 = unchanged, 3 = significantly improved, 4 = completely resolved), and postprocedural complications were identified.\nThe 136 vascular malformations in 135 patients included 59 (43.7%) males and 76 (56.3%) females, ranging in age from under 1 year to 68 years (mean, 25.3 \u00b1 17.0 years). In order to facilitate application of the therapeutic algorithm, all patients underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to determine critical lesion characteristics, including flow quality and lesion extension. Of the 105 low-flow vascular malformations (LFVM), 23 (21.9%) were managed conservatively, 38 (36.2%) were treated with sclerotherapy (sodium tetradecyl sulfate, polidocanol, and/or ethanol), 18 (17.1%) were surgically resected, and eight (7.6%) were managed with a combination of modalities. Of the 31 high-flow vascular malformations (HFVM), eight (25.8%) were managed conservatively, eight (25.8%) were treated with transcatheter arterial embolization, six (19.4%) required embolization followed by sclerotherapy, and five (16.1%) were primarily resected. Patients in all groups managed conservatively had minimal alteration in status. Response to sclerotherapy in the LFVM group resulted in improvement in 32 (84.2%) patients, surgical resection resulted in improvement in 16 (88.9%) patients, and combination therapy resulted in improvement in eight (100%) patients. Treatment with embolization in the HFVM group resulted in improvement in seven (87.5%) patients, while combination therapy resulted in improvement in six (100%), and surgical resection led to improvement in four (80%). Complications were observed in six (6.8%) patients treated for LFVMs (0 with sodium tetradecyl sulfate or polidocanol, four with ethanol, two with resection), and two (7.4%) patients treated for HFVMs with embolization or combination therapy.\nIn this large cohort of vascular malformation patients, implementation of the proposed diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms in a multidisciplinary setting resulted in favorable outcomes with an acceptable complication rate in this challenging patient population.",

    "abstract": "Chyloperitoneum is an uncommon but serious complication of abdominal aortic surgery. There are no optimal guidelines for the management of chyloperitoneum. We present here our experiences regarding the treatment of chyloperitoneum with somatostatin for three patients who underwent surgery for abdominal aortic disease. Milky, odorless liquid was observed in the abdominal drain of these patients. The conservative treatment with total parenteral nutrition failed; therefore, in parallel, we initiated a somatostatin treatment as a continuous perfusion. Drain loss decreased in all up to the second day of treatment. The probable mechanisms of the somatostatin decrease the intestinal absorption of fats via the specific receptors, decrease triglyceride concentration in the thoracic duct, and attenuate lymph flow in the major lymphatic channels. The presented cases showed successful treatment using somatostatin and may be a new generation of effective treatments for chyloperitoneum.",

    "abstract": "We report the 5-year outcomes of thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) using the Medtronic Vascular Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, Calif) in patients considered low or moderate risk for open surgical repair.\nThe Evaluation of the Medtronic Vascular Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System for the Treatment of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms (VALOR) trial was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, pivotal study conducted at 38 U.S. sites. Between December 2003 and June 2005, VALOR enrolled 195 patients who were low or moderate risk (0, 1, and 2) per the modified Society for Vascular Surgery and American Association for Vascular Surgery criteria. The patients had fusiform thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) and/or focal saccular TAAs/penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers. Standard follow-up interval examinations were conducted at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter.\nOver the 5-year follow-up, 76 deaths occurred (43.9%). Freedom from all-cause mortality was 83.9% at 1 year and 58.5% at 5 years. Most deaths were due to cardiac, pulmonary or cancer-related causes. Freedom from aneurysm-related mortality (ARM) was 96.9% at 1 year and 96.1% at 5 years. There was only 1 case of ARM after the first year of follow-up. Over the 5-year follow-up period, four patients were converted to open surgery and four patients experienced aneurysm rupture. The 5-year freedom from aneurysm rupture was 97.1% and the 5-year freedom from conversion to surgery was 97.1%. The incidence of stent graft migration (>10 mm) was \u2264 1.8% in each year of follow-up. The rate of type I endoleak was 4.6% at 1 month, 6.3% from 1 month to 1 year, and 3.8% during year 5. The rate of type III endoleak was 1.3% at 1 month, 1.9% from 1 month to 1 year, and 1.9% during year 5. Through 5 years, 28 patients (14.4%) underwent 31 additional endovascular procedures on the original target lesion. The 5-year freedom from secondary endovascular procedures was 81.5%.\nThrough 5-year follow-up in patients who were candidates for open surgical repair, TEVAR using the Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System has demonstrated sustained protection from ARM, aneurysm rupture, and conversion to surgery, and durable stent graft performance. Close patient follow-up remains essential after TEVAR.",

    "abstract": "Congenital abnormalities of the internal carotid artery (ICA) are infrequent and can be associated with aberrations of the Circle of Willis. A 47-year-old gentleman presented with transient neurological symptoms and cerebral infarction and carotid Doppler showed a stenotic right ICA. Subsequent computed tomographic angiography showed a hypoplastic ICA with a low-lying bifurcation at the C6 level and aplasia of the anterior communicating artery. This patient was commenced on aggressive medical therapy and at 7-month follow-up was symptom-free. This case report highlights the need for a centralized registry with long-term follow-up data in order to identify optimal management.",

Although CAS outcomes have improved during the last decade, the associated stroke rate remains higher when compared with carotid endarterectomy. Therefore, the pivotal role of embolic protection devices (EPDs) in minimizing stroke risk cannot be underestimated as a vital component of CAS. As technology advances, EPDs continue to be refined, and each device currently on the market has its own advantages and disadvantages. This review provides an overview of the current status of EPDs and highlights the unique features of each device, followed by suggestions for application in specific clinical scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The new integrated 0 + 5 vascular surgery (VS) training paradigm introduced in 2007 required program directors and faculty to reconsider recruiting methods and exposure of medical students to VS. As a means to identify variables important for recruitment of 0 + 5 VS applicants, we sought to analyze national 0 + 5 VS residency application trends and to compare medical school demographics of applicants to both our 0 + 5 residency and 5 + 2 fellowship programs.\nElectronic Residency Application Service and National Resident Matching Program online public databases were queried to evaluate nationwide trends in the number of applicants to integrated VS residency programs between 2007 and 2010. Demographic data from Electronic Residency Application Service applications submitted to our institution's 0 + 5 and 5 + 2 VS training programs during the same time period were reviewed.\nFrom 2008 to 2011, there were 190 applicants to our 0 + 5 VS residency program and 161 applicants to our 5 + 2 fellowship program, with 127 (66.8%) and 122 (75.8%) being United States medical graduates, respectively. Annual application volume to our programs over these years remained stable for both training pathways (range, 39-49 for 0 + 5 integrated; range, 39-43 for 5 + 2 traditional). Nationally, applications to 0 + 5 programs increased sixfold over the same time period (52 in 2007 to 340 applicants in 2010; P < .001), far exceeding the available training positions. Compared with applicants to the 5 + 2 VS fellowships, medical students applying to the 0 + 5 programs are more likely to be female, be slightly older, have additional postgraduate degrees and publications, have higher United States Medical Licensure Examination test scores, and are more likely to be in the top quartile of their medical school class.\nNationwide interest in the 0 + 5 vascular surgery residency training paradigm continues to significantly increase. Significant differences exist between the cohorts of 0 + 5 residency and 5 + 2 fellowship program applicants at the completion of medical school, suggesting that 0 + 5 VS residency programs are attracting a different medical student population to the VS specialty. VS program directors should continue to foster interest in this new applicant pool through early exposure, mentorship, and extracurricular research activities.",

    "abstract": "Delayed carotid endarterectomy (CEA) after a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) is associated with risks of recurrent neurologic symptoms. In an effort to preserve cerebral function, urgent early CEA has been recommended in many circumstances. We analyzed outcomes of different time intervals in early CEA in comparison with delayed treatment.\nRetrospective chart review from a single university hospital tertiary care center between April 1999 and November 2010 revealed 312 patients who underwent CEA following stroke or TIA. Of these 312 patients, 69 received their CEA within 30 days of symptom onset and 243 received their CEA after 30 days from symptom onset. The early CEA cohort was further stratified according to the timing of surgery: group A (27 patients), within 7 days; group B (17), between 8 and 14 days; group C (12), between 15 and 21 days; and group D (12), between 22 and 30 days. Demographic data as well as 30-day (mortality, stroke, TIA, and myocardial infarction) and long-term (all-cause mortality and stroke) adverse outcome rates were analyzed for each group. These were also analyzed for the entire early CEA cohort and compared against the delayed CEA group.\nDemographics and comorbid conditions were similar between groups. For 30-day outcomes, there were no deaths, 1 stroke (1.4%), 0 TIAs, and 0 myocardial infarctions in the early CEA cohort; in the delayed CEA cohort, there were 4 (1.6%), 4 (1.6%), 2 (0.8%), and 2 (0.8%) patients with these outcomes, respectively (P > .05 for all comparisons). Over the long term, the early group had one ipsilateral stroke at 17 months and the delayed group had two ipsilateral strokes at 3 and 12 months. For long-term outcomes, there were 16 deaths in the early CEA cohort (21%) and 74 deaths in the delayed CEA cohort (30%, P > .05). Mean follow-up times were 4.5 years in the early CEA cohort and 5.8 years in the delayed CEA cohort.\nThere were no differences in 30-day and long-term adverse outcome rates between the early and delayed CEA cohorts. In symptomatic carotid stenosis patients without evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage, carotid occlusion, or permanent neurologic deficits early carotid endarterectomy can be safely performed and is preferred over delaying operative treatment.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased morbidity and death after open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (OAR). This study highlights the effect of CKD on outcomes after endovascular AAA (EVAR) and OAR in contemporary practice.\nThe National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) Participant Use File (2005-2008) was queried by Current Procedural Terminology (American Medical Association, Chicago, Ill) code to identify EVAR or OAR patients, who were grouped by CKD class as having mild (CKD class 1 or 2), moderate (CKD class 3), or severe (CKD class 4 or 5) renal disease. Propensity score analysis was performed to match OAR and EVAR patients with mild CKD with those with moderate or severe CKD. Comparative analysis of mortality and clinical outcomes was performed based on CKD strata.\nWe identified 8701 patients who were treated with EVAR (n = 5811) or OAR (n = 2890) of intact AAAs. Mild, moderate, and severe CKD was present in 63%, 30%, and 7%, respectively. CKD increased (P < .01) overall mortality, with rates of 1.7% (mild), 5.3% (moderate), and 7.7% (severe) in unmatched patients undergoing EVAR or OAR. Operative mortality rates in patients with severe CKD were as high as 6.2% for EVAR and 10.3% for OAR. Severity of CKD was associated with increasing frequency of risk factors; therefore, propensity matching to control for comorbidities was performed, resulting in similar baseline clinical and demographic features of patients with mild compared with those with moderate or severe disease. In propensity-matched cohorts, moderate CKD increased the risk of 30-day mortality for EVAR (1.9% mild vs 3.2% moderate; P = .013) and OAR (3.1% mild vs 8.4% moderate; P < .0001). Moderate CKD was also associated with increased morbidity in patients treated with EVAR (8.3% mild vs 12.8% moderate; P < .0001) or OAR (25.2% mild vs 32.4% moderate; P = .001). Similarly, severe CKD increased the risk of 30-day mortality for EVAR (2.6% mild vs 5.7% severe; P = .0081) and OAR (4.1% mild vs 9.9% severe; P = .0057). Severe CKD was also associated with increased morbidity in patients treated with EVAR (10.6% mild vs 19.2% severe; P < .0001) or OAR (31.1% mild vs 39.6% severe; P = .04).\nThe presence of moderate or severe CKD in patients considered for AAA repair is associated with significantly increased mortality and therefore should figure prominently in clinical decision making. The high mortality of AAA repair in patients with severe CKD is such that elective repair in such patients is not advised, except in extenuating clinical circumstances.",

CKD increased (P < .01) overall mortality, with rates of 1.7% (mild), 5.3% (moderate), and 7.7% (severe) in unmatched patients undergoing EVAR or OAR. Operative mortality rates in patients with severe CKD were as high as 6.2% for EVAR and 10.3% for OAR. Severity of CKD was associated with increasing frequency of risk factors; therefore, propensity matching to control for comorbidities was performed, resulting in similar baseline clinical and demographic features of patients with mild compared with those with moderate or severe disease. In propensity-matched cohorts, moderate CKD increased the risk of 30-day mortality for EVAR (1.9% mild vs 3.2% moderate; P = .013) and OAR (3.1% mild vs 8.4% moderate; P < .0001). Moderate CKD was also associated with increased morbidity in patients treated with EVAR (8.3% mild vs 12.8% moderate; P < .0001) or OAR (25.2% mild vs 32.4% moderate; P = .001). Similarly, severe CKD increased the risk of 30-day mortality for EVAR (2.6% mild vs 5.7% severe; P = .0081) and OAR (4.1% mild vs 9.9% severe; P = .0057).

    "abstract": "We wanted to examine whether brain computed tomography (CT) perfusion can help to detect the reconstitution of cerebral hemodynamics and predict intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) after carotid stenting.\nFrom September 2002 to October 2009, data of 114 patients with carotid intervention were prospectively collected, and we retrospectively identified a total of 108 consecutive patients with unilateral carotid stenting. Brain CT perfusion was studied at three time points: 1 week before, and 1 week and 6 months after stenting. Cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow, and time to peak (TTP) of brain CT perfusion were examined at cortical and subcortical areas of middle cerebral artery (MCA) and posterior cerebral artery territory. The CBV, cerebral blood flow, and TTP ratios of stenting side/nonstenting side were used for comparison. The flow direction of ophthalmic artery was detected by sonography, and the presence of anterior communicating artery was examined on prestenting cerebral angiogram.\nAfter carotid stenting, CBV and TTP ratios improved significantly in both MCA cortical and subcortical areas in patients with unilateral carotid stenosis (P < .01) but not in patients with bilateral carotid stenosis. Patients with reversed ophthalmic flow had better improvement of TTP in both MCA and posterior cerebral artery territories (P < .05) than patients with forward flow. However, no significant difference was found between patients with and patients without anterior communicating artery collateral (P > .05). The prestenting TTP ratio in MCA subcortical area was significantly higher in patients with poststenting ICH than patients without ICH (P = .0191).\nCerebral hemodynamics can be reconstituted within a few days after carotid revascularization, especially in patients with reversed ophthalmic flow. Prolonged TTP in prestenting MCA subcortical area may suggest a high risk of poststenting ICH.",

    "abstract": "Contralateral carotid artery occlusion by itself carries an increased risk of stroke. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the presence of contralateral carotid artery occlusion has high reported rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Our objective was to determine if there is a clinical benefit to patients who receive carotid artery stenting (CAS) compared to CEA in the presence of contralateral carotid artery occlusion.\nWe conducted a retrospective medical chart review over a 4.5-year institutional experience of persons with contralateral carotid artery occlusion and ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis who underwent CAS or CEA. The main outcome measures were 30-day cardiac, stroke, and mortality rate, and midterm mortality.\nOf a total of 713 patients treated for carotid artery stenosis during this time period, 57 had contralateral occlusion (~8%). Thirty-nine of these patients were treated with CAS, and 18 with CEA. The most common indications for CAS were prior neck surgery (18), contralateral internal carotid occlusion (nine), and prior neck radiation (seven). The average age was 70 \u00b1 8.5 for CEA and 66.7 \u00b1 9.3 for CAS (P = .20). Both groups were predominantly men (CEA 12 of 18; CAS 28 of 39; P = .76), with similar prevalence of symptomatic lesions (CEA 8 of 18, CAS 20 of 39; P = .77). Two patients died within 30 days in the CAS group (5%). No deaths occurred within 30 days in the CEA group (P = .50); the mortality rate for CAS and CEA combined was 3.5%. No perioperative strokes or myocardial infarction occurred in either group. Two transient ischemic attacks occurred after CAS. At mean follow-up of 29.4 \u00b1 16 months (CEA) and 28 \u00b1 14.4 months (CAS; range, 1.5-48.5 months), seven deaths occurred in the CAS group and one in the CEA group (17.9% vs 5.5%; P = .40). There were two reinterventions in the CAS group for in-stent restenosis and there were no reoperations in the CEA group.\nAlthough CEA and CAS can both be performed with good perioperative results and acceptable midterm mortality, the observed outcomes do not support use of contralateral carotid artery occlusion as a selection criterion for CAS over CEA in the absence of other indications.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is known to have a survival benefit over open repair in patients with descending thoracic aneurysms and has become a mainstay of therapy. Because death before 1 year after TEVAR likely indicates an ineffective therapy, we have created a predictive model for death within 1 year using factors available in the preoperative setting.\nA registry of 526 TEVARs performed at the University of Florida between September 2000 and November 2010 was queried for patients with degenerative descending thoracic aneurysm as their primary pathology. Procedures with emergent or urgent indications were excluded. Preoperatively available variables, such as baseline comorbidities, anatomic-, and procedure-specific planning details, were recorded. Univariate predictors of death were analyzed with multivariable Cox proportional hazards to identify independent predictors of 30-day (death within 30 days) and 1-year mortality (death within 1 year) after TEVAR.\nA total of 224 patients were identified and evaluated. The 30-day mortality rate was 3% (n = 7) and the 1-year mortality rate was 15% (n = 33). Multivariable predictors of 1-year mortality (hazard ratios [95% confidence interval]) included: age >70 years (5.8 [2.1-16.0]; P = .001), adjunctive intraoperative procedures (eg, brachiocephalic or visceral stents, or both, concomitant arch debranching procedures; 4.5 [1.9-10.8]; P = .001), peripheral arterial disease (3.0 [1.4-6.7]; P = .006), coronary artery disease (2.4 [1.1-4.9]; P = .02), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.9 [1.0-3.9]; P = .06). A diagnosis of hyperlipidemia was protective (0.4 [0.2-0.7]; P = .006). When patients were grouped into those with one, two, three, or four or more of these risk factors, the predicted 1-year mortality was 1%, 3%, 10%, 27%, and 54%, respectively.\nFactors are available in the preoperative setting that are predictive of death within 1 year after TEVAR and can guide clinical decision making regarding the timing of repair. Patients with multiple risk factors, such as age \u2265 70 years, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a need for an extensive procedure involving adjunctive therapies, have a high predicted mortality within 1 year and may be best served by waiting for a larger aneurysm size to justify the risk of intervention.",

    "abstract": "Successful catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) for iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (IFDVT) reduces post-thrombotic morbidity and is a suggested treatment option by the American College of Chest Physicians for patients with IFDVT. Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (PMT) is also suggested to shorten treatment time and reduce the dose of plasminogen activator. However, concern remains that mechanical devices might damage vein valves. The purpose of this study is to examine whether PMT adversely affects venous valve function compared to CDT alone in IFDVT patients treated with catheter-based techniques.\nSixty-nine limbs in 54 patients (39 unilateral, 15 bilateral) who underwent catheter-based treatment for IFDVT form the basis of this study. Lytic success and degree of residual obstruction were analyzed by reviewing postprocedural phlebograms. All patients underwent bilateral postprocedure duplex to evaluate patency and valve function. Phlebograms and venous duplex examinations were interpreted in a blinded fashion. Limbs were analyzed based on the method of treatment: CDT alone (n = 20), PMT using rheolytic thrombolysis (n = 14), and isolated pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (n = 35). The validated outcome measures were compared between the treatment groups.\nSixty-nine limbs underwent CDT with or without PMT. The average patient age was 47 years (range, 16-78). Venous duplex was performed 44.4 months (mean) post-treatment. Of the limbs treated with CDT with drip technique, 65% demonstrated reflux vs 53% treated with PMT (P = .42). There was no difference in long-term valve function between patients treated with rheolytic and isolated pharmacomechanical thrombolysis. In the bilateral group, 87% (13/15) demonstrated reflux in at least one limb. In the unilateral group, 64% (25/39) had reflux in their treated limb and 36% (14/39) in their contralateral limb. There was no correlation effect of residual venous obstruction on valve function, although few patients had >50% residual obstruction.\nIn patients undergoing catheter-based intervention for IFDVT, PMT does not adversely affect valve function compared with CDT alone. A higher than expected number of patients had reflux in their uninvolved limb.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the remodeling of proximal neck (PN) angulations of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nA 64-row multidetector computed tomography scan of AAAs treated with EVAR was reviewed, and the PN angulation was measured on a volume-rendered three-dimensional image. The computed tomography scan was examined preoperatively, after EVAR at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years, 2 years, and then yearly. The study enrolled 78 patients, comprising 54 Zenith devices (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) and 24 Excluder devices (W. L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz).\nPN angulation was 50\u00b0 \u00b1 20\u00b0 preoperatively, and after EVAR was 36\u00b0 \u00b1 14\u00b0 at 1 week, 32\u00b0 \u00b1 14\u00b0 at 1 year, and 28\u00b0 \u00b1 13\u00b0 at 3 years. PN angulations \u2264 60\u00b0 (n = 70, 77%) were 41\u00b0 \u00b1 13\u00b0 preoperatively, 31\u00b0 \u00b1 12\u00b0 1 week after EVAR, 28\u00b0 \u00b1 12\u00b0 at 1 year, and 26\u00b0 \u00b1 13\u00b0 after 3 years. An angulation >60\u00b0 (n = 18, 23%) was 78\u00b0 \u00b1 14\u00b0 preoperatively, 51\u00b0 \u00b1 11\u00b0 1 week after EVAR, 44\u00b0 \u00b1 11\u00b0 at 1 year, and 40\u00b0 \u00b1 12\u00b0 after 3 years. The greater the preoperative PN angulation, the greater its reduction immediately after EVAR (r = .72, P < .001). The diameter shrinkage of AAAs with a PN angulation >60\u00b0 was 3 \u00b1 6 mm after 1 year; a significantly smaller shrinkage than with a PN angulation \u2264 60\u00b0 (7 \u00b1 7 mm, P < .05). AAAs with a PN angulation >60\u00b0 had a larger angulation reduction and a smaller diameter shrinkage after the EVAR procedure. The PN angulation of the 54 AAAs treated by Zenith was 49\u00b0 \u00b1 22\u00b0 preoperatively, 34\u00b0 \u00b1 14\u00b0 1 week after EVAR, and 25\u00b0 \u00b1 13\u00b0 after 3 years. The corresponding angulation of the 24 AAAs treated by Excluder devices was 52\u00b0 \u00b1 17\u00b0, 41\u00b0 \u00b1 14\u00b0, and 38\u00b0 \u00b1 9\u00b0, respectively. The PN angulation reduction of Zenith and Excluder was similar 1 week after the EVAR procedure. Unlike Excluder, however, the PN angulation in Zenith continued to reduce for a long period at a slow pace. There were no significant correlations between PN angulation reduction and diameter change and between PN length and diameter change (P = .86 and .18, respectively).\nAlthough the instructions for use of most commercially available stent grafts provide for a PN angulation of \u2264 60\u00b0, PN angulation was not a major issue in a midterm follow-up of AAAs with adequate PN length for patients in this series who received a Zenith or Excluder graft.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the safety and effectiveness of the infrainguinal use of the AngioJet rheolytic mechanical thrombectomy system (Possis Medical, Minneapolis, Minn) for the treatment of acute infrainguinal thromboembolism occurring during lower limb revascularization procedures.\nFor the interval between January 2000 and January 2011, our hospital's database was meticulously searched for all patients with acute thromboembolism that occurred during lower limb angioplasty, with or without stenting procedures, who were treated with infrainguinal AngioJet thrombectomy. Baseline patient demographics and procedural details were analyzed. Primary end points included technical success, defined as the complete revascularization of the acutely occluded vessel; clinical success, defined as the absence of death or amputation \u2264 60 days; and procedure-related complication. Secondary end points included embolized vessel primary patency and overall patient survival.\nDuring this 12-year period, 3147 peripheral percutaneous procedures of angioplasty, with or without stenting, were performed in our department. Intraoperative, clinically, and angiographically evident thromboembolism occurred in 18 of 3147 procedures (0.57%), and 14 (77.7%) were managed using the AngioJet thrombectomy system. In total, 22 arteries were treated (13 infrapopliteal, 3 femoropopliteal, and 6 popliteal arteries). All patients had a completion angiogram for the assessment of the runoff vessels' status. Technical and clinical success occurred in 13 of 14 (92.8%). Adjunctive local thrombolysis or clot trapping, or both, with stenting was used in 64.3% and 42.8% of the procedures, respectively. Mean time follow-up was 38.1 \u00b1 49.0 months. The 1-year embolized vessel primary patency rate was 50.9%, and the survival rate was 53.5% up to 11.5 years of follow-up, as estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The 1-year limb salvage rate was 92.3%. There were no procedure-related minor amputations and one (7.1%) procedure-related major above-knee amputation.\nThe use of AngioJet rheolytic thrombectomy and adjunctive local thrombolysis or stenting, or both, under filter protection, is safe and effective for the management of severe thromboembolic complications occurring in the femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal arteries during peripheral endovascular procedures.",

The Valiant stent graft is an evolution of the Talent thoracic stent graft (Medtronic Vascular).\nThe VALOR II (Evaluation of the Clinical Performance of the Valiant Thoracic Stent Graft System in the Treatment of Descending Thoracic Aneurysms of Degenerative Etiology in Subjects Who Are Candidates for Endovascular Repair) was a prospective, nonrandomized, pivotal trial conducted at 24 U.S. sites with enrollment between December 2006 and September 2009. Standard follow-up examinations, including physical examination, computed tomography, and chest radiography, were at 1, 6, and 12 months, and annually through 5 years. VALOR II outcomes were compared with those from the pivotal VALOR (Evaluation of the Medtronic Vascular Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System for the Treatment of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms) trial of the Talent stent graft, which enrolled 195 patients with similar enrollment criteria.\nVALOR II enrolled 160 patients. Compared with VALOR patients, VALOR II patients had similar age and sex distribution but higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors and significantly more severe modified Society for Vascular Surgery/American Association for Vascular Surgery risk scores. Stent graft delivery and deployment were successful in 154 patients (96.3%). Outcomes at 30 days in VALOR II were perioperative mortality, 3.1%; major adverse events, 38.1%; paraplegia, 0.6%; paraparesis, 1.9%; and stroke, 2.5%. At 12 months, after the minimum sample size was reached, 151 patients were evaluated: aneurysm-related mortality was 4.0%, stent graft migration was 2.9%, and endoleak was 13.0%. Through 12 months, there were no ruptures, conversions to open surgery, secondary procedures due to endoleak >30 days, or loss of stent graft patency. The Valiant stent graft was statistically noninferior to the Talent stent graft in 12-month all-cause mortality (12.6% vs 16.1%) and exceeded the primary effectiveness goal of 12-month successful aneurysm treatment, defined as absence of aneurysm growth >5 mm and of secondary procedures for type I/III endoleak (97.4% vs 80.0%).\nThe VALOR II 12-month results demonstrate that the Medtronic Valiant thoracic stent graft is a safe and effective treatment for patients with descending thoracic aortic aneurysms of degenerative etiology.",

    "abstract": "Despite surgical adjuncts, paralysis remains a devastating complication after thoracoabdominal aortic interventions. Dexmedetomidine, a selective \u03b1-2a agonist commonly used for sedation in the critical care setting, has been shown to have protective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injuries in multiple organ systems. We hypothesized that treatment with dexmedetomidine would attenuate spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury via \u03b1-2a receptor activation.\nAdult C57BL/6 mice underwent sternotomy, followed by occlusion of the aortic arch for 4 minutes. Eight experimental mice received pretreatment with intraperitoneal dexmedetomidine (25 \u03bcg/kg) and at 12-hour intervals after reperfusion. Eight control mice received an equivalent amount of 0.9% normal saline. Five mice underwent the same procedure with dexmedetomidine (25 \u03bcg/kg) and atipamezole (250 \u03bcg/kg), an \u03b1-2a receptor antagonist. Functional analysis of the mice was obtained at 12-hour intervals and scored using the Basso Mouse Scale for Locomotion until 60 hours. All mice were euthanized at 60 hours. Their spinal cords were removed en bloc and were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to assess cytoarchitecture and neuronal viability.\nMice treated with the \u03b1-2a agonist demonstrated preserved motor function compared with ischemic controls and with mice treated with the \u03b1-2a antagonist in addition to the agonist. Functional differences in the dexmedetomidine group were statistically significant from 24 hours through the remainder of the experiment (P < .05). In addition, the treated mice had preserved cytoarchitecture, decreased vacuolization, and improved neuronal viability compared with ischemic control mice and mice concurrently treated with atipamezole, the dexmedetomidine \u03b1-2a antagonist.\nTreatment of mice with the \u03b1-2a agonist dexmedetomidine preserves motor function and neuronal viability after aortic cross-clamping. In addition, mice exhibited almost complete reversal of the protective effect with the administration of the \u03b1-2a receptor antagonist atipamezole. Dexmedetomidine appears to attenuate spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury via \u03b1-2a receptor-mediated agonism.\nThere remains a significant risk of paraplegia after thoracoabdominal aortic interventions. This complication is devastating to the patient and the health care system. Pharmacologic adjuncts to further decrease this complication have been studied; however, few viable options exist. The \u03b1-2a agonists have been shown to improve outcomes after strokes but have not been studied in spinal cord ischemia. We show that dexmedetomidine, a commonly used \u03b1-2a agonist in the operating room, can preserve neurologic function in mice after aortic cross-clamping. Although the protective mechanism of dexmedetomidine remains unknown, it might prove to be beneficial in reducing the incidence of paraplegia after aortic interventions.",

    "abstract": "In addition to increased risks for aneurysm-related death, previous studies have determined that all-cause mortality in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients is excessive and equivalent to that associated with coronary heart disease. These studies largely preceded the current era of coronary heart disease risk factor management, however, and no recent study has examined contemporary mortality associated with early AAA disease (aneurysm diameter between 3 and 5 cm). As part of an ongoing natural history study of AAA, we report the mortality risk associated with presence of early disease.\nParticipants were recruited from three distinct health care systems in Northern California between 2006 and 2011. Aneurysm diameter, demographic information, comorbidities, medication history, and plasma for biomarker analysis were collected at study entry. Survival status was determined at follow-up. Data were analyzed with t-tests or \u03c7(2) tests where appropriate. Freedom from death was calculated via Cox proportional hazards modeling; the relevance of individual predictors on mortality was determined by log-rank test.\nThe study enrolled 634 AAA patients; age 76.4 \u00b1 8.0 years, aortic diameter 3.86 \u00b1 0.7 cm. Participants were mostly male (88.8%), not current smokers (81.6%), and taking statins (76.7%). Mean follow-up was 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 years. Estimated 1- and 3-year survival was 98.2% and 90.9%, respectively. Factors independently associated with mortality included larger aneurysm size (hazard ratio, 2.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-3.57 for diameter >4.0 cm) and diabetes (hazard ratio, 2.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-4.47). After adjusting for patient-level factors, health care system independently predicted mortality.\nContemporary all-cause mortality for patients with early AAA disease is lower than that previously reported. Further research is warranted to determine important factors that contribute to improved survival in early AAA disease.",

    "abstract": "The effect of diabetes type (noninsulin dependent vs insulin dependent) on outcomes after lower-extremity bypass (LEB) has not been clearly defined. Therefore, we analyzed associations between diabetes type and outcomes after LEB in patients with critical limb ischemia.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of 1977 infrainguinal LEB operations done for critical limb ischemia between 2003 and 2010 within the Vascular Study Group of New England. Patients were categorized as nondiabetic (ND), noninsulin-dependent diabetic (NIDD), or insulin-dependent diabetic (IDD) based on their preoperative medication regimen. Our main outcome measures were in-hospital mortality and major adverse events (MAEs)--a composite outcome, including myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, congestive heart failure, wound infection, renal insufficiency, and major amputation. We compared crude and adjusted rates of mortality and MAEs using logistic regression across diabetes categories.\nOverall, 41% of patients were ND, 28% were NIDD, and 31% were IDD. Crude rates of in-hospital mortality were similar across these groups (1.7% vs 3.1% vs 2.1%; P = .211). Adjusted analyses accounting for differences in patient characteristics showed that diabetes is not associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality. However, type of diabetes was associated with a higher risk of MAEs in both crude (15.1% for ND; 21.1% for NIDD; and 25.2% for IDD; P < .001) and adjusted analyses (odds ratio for NIDD, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-1.7; odds ratio for IDD, 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-1.8).\nDiabetes is a significant contributor to the risk of postoperative complications after LEB surgery, and insulin dependence is associated with higher risk. Quality measures aimed at limiting complications after LEB may have the most impact if these initiatives are focused on patients who are IDD.",

    "abstract": "Giant intracranial artery aneurysms (GIAAs) are often not amenable to neurosurgical clipping or endovascular coiling. Extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass, a procedure that has been essentially abandoned for the treatment of intracranial ischemic disease, followed by parent vessel occlusion, is often successful in treating these aneurysms. Vascular surgeons should be familiar with this operation, especially in centers with neurosurgical capability.\nA retrospective review of patients treated from 1990 to 2010 at New York University Medical Center was performed. Office and hospital records of all patients identified were reviewed with attention to the age and sex of the patient, presenting symptoms, preoperative testing, procedure performed, type of bypass conduit, graft patency, intraoperative and postoperative complications, length of follow-up, and overall outcome. EC-IC bypass was performed using a graft of great saphenous vein (GSV) or radial artery (RA). The vascular surgeon harvested the vascular conduit, tunneled the graft, and performed the extracranial anastomosis, and the intracranial anastomosis was performed by the neurosurgeon.\nA total of 36 patients (14 men, 22 women) underwent 37 EC-IC bypasses with 34 GSV and three RA grafts. The median age was 57 years (interquartile range, 49-66 years), and the median follow-up was 53 months (interquartile range, 29-77 months). Aneurysm location was the internal carotid artery in 30 patients, the basilar artery in three, and the middle cerebral artery in four. All 37 aneurysms were excluded from the cerebral circulation, with 33 grafts remaining patent at follow-up, as determined by serial cerebral or magnetic resonance angiogram. At follow-up, 33 of 34 of the GSV grafts (88%) and three of three (100%) of the RA grafts were patent. There were two deaths (5.6%), despite patent grafts. Postoperative graft occlusion led to homonymous hemianopsia in one patient and temporary hemiparesis in another (5.6%). Graft occlusions were asymptomatic in two patients.\nEC-IC bypass is a safe and effective treatment for GIAAs, with acceptable rates of morbidity (5.6%), mortality (5.6%), and graft patency (89.2%). We suggest that the technique described in this report should be routinely used for treatment of GIAAs in centers where neurosurgery and vascular surgery services are available and should be considered a standard procedure in the armamentarium of the vascular surgeon.",

    "abstract": "Autologous greater saphenous vein (GSV) graft is frequently used as a conduit during arterial bypass. Preoperative vein mapping has been traditionally used to assess conduit adequacy and define GSV anatomy, thereby decreasing operative time and reducing wound complications. The purpose of this study was to determine whether GSV mapping using computed tomography angiography (CTA) closely correlated with that of traditional duplex ultrasonography (US).\nFrom August 2009 through June 2011, 88 limbs from 51 patients underwent CTA of the lower extremities for the purpose of defining arterial anatomy with concurrent US for preoperative vein mapping. GSV diameters were measured by two blinded reviewers on CTA (both antero-posterior [AP] and lateral dimensions) and compared with US-based measurements at levels of the proximal thigh, mid-thigh, knee, mid-calf, and ankle. CTA and US measurements were compared at each anatomic level using linear regression. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. Charge reduction was calculated based on technical and professional fees for each imaging study.\nGSV diameter sequentially decreased from the proximal thigh to the mid-calf and then increased to the ankle as measured by CTA and US. CTA-based measurements of the GSV significantly correlated with US GSV diameters (R = 0.927 [lateral dimension], 0.922 [AP dimension]; P < .005). The strongest degree of correlation occurred in measurements at the proximal thigh, followed by the mid-thigh, mid-calf, knee, and ankle. GSV measurement by CTA was over 90% sensitive and accurate for detecting appropriate GSV diameter for bypass (diameter >2.0 mm). Eliminating preoperative US vein mapping for the study patients at our institution would have resulted in charge reductions of $49,316 over the study period.\nIndirect venography by CTA correlates well with US for GSV mapping in the lower extremity and offers significant reduction in imaging-related preoperative charges. CTA is sensitive and accurate for detecting GSVs that are appropriate for bypass. Furthermore, CTA allows AP and lateral evaluation of the GSV throughout its anatomic course. As CTA is often performed prior to arterial bypass, indirect evaluation of the GSV using preoperative CTA should be considered a promising alternative to the use of US.",

    "abstract": "Pulsatile flow in deep, perforating veins and varicose veins (VVs) has been described previously to support a hypothesis of arteriovenous (AV) fistulae in the pathogenesis of VVs. Its presence has also been suggested as a cause of failure of VV treatments. However, AV communications have never been adequately visualized and direct pressure tracings within leg veins have been inconclusive. The present study was observational aiming to investigate the prevalence and rate of spontaneous pulsation within the great saphenous vein (GSV) in volunteers and patients using color duplex and compare this to reflux and markers of disease severity.\nTwenty-seven consecutive patients (32 legs, median Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) = 5 [0-11]) attending the VV clinic and 23 consecutive ambulatory normal volunteers (46 legs) had their GSV assessed at midthigh using color duplex. Subjects were examined standing with the hips resting against an adjustable couch, bearing weight on the contralateral leg, with the test leg touching the ground. The presence of flow and reflux were initially determined using manual calf compression. Saphenous pulsation (SP) was defined as a cyclical change in velocity. The GSV diameter and SP rate were then recorded after 2 minutes of dependency. The number of pulsations was counted from video recordings.\nThe resting SP, if present, was discrete, monophasic, of variable amplitude, antegrade, and irregular, irrespective of respiration. Pulsation was detected in 2/44 (4.5%) legs with C(0-1) (C part of CEAP), 9/17 (52.9%) legs with C(2-3), and 16/17 (94.1%) legs with C(4-6) (P < .05, z test of column proportions). Reflux occurred in 8/32 (25%) legs without SP (C(0) = 2, C(1) = 1, C(2) = 3, C(3) = 2). The median GSV diameter was significantly elevated in the presence of SP (no pulse: 3.5 [range, 1.5-8.1] mm; pulse: 7 [range, 4-9.4] mm; P < .0005). The median refluxing GSV diameter in GSV pulsators compared with nonpulsators was 7 (range, 4-9.4) mm; vs 5.1 (range, 2.7-8.1) mm, respectively (P = .003). The median SP rate in refluxing GSVs was 52 (range, 22-95) beats per minute.\nThe high prevalence of pulsatile antegrade saphenous flow is a novel observation in patients with severe superficial chronic venous insufficiency. It is detectable in 75% of patients with GSV reflux and significantly increases with clinical severity and saphenous diameter. It may be a marker of advanced venous disease and, as it is easy to record, it could supplement duplex evaluations of reflux. Further work is needed to establish the clinical relevance of the SP in terms of disease progression, recurrence after treatment, and as a hemodynamic marker of severity.",

    "abstract": "Because vein graft neointimal hyperplasia engenders vein graft failure, and because most vein graft neointimal cells derive from outside the vein graft, we sought to determine whether vein graft neointimal hyperplasia is affected by activity of the CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4), which is important for bone marrow-derived cell migration.\nIn congenic Cxcr4(-/+) and wild-type (WT) recipient mice, we performed interposition grafting of the common carotid artery with the inferior vena cava (IVC) of either Cxcr4(-/+) or WT mice to create four surgically chimeric groups of mice (n \u2265 5 each), characterized by vein graft donor/recipient: WT/WT; Cxcr4(-/+)/WT; WT/Cxcr4(-/+); and Cxcr4(-/+)/Cxcr4(-/+); vein grafts were harvested 6 weeks postoperatively.\nThe agonist for CXCR4 is expressed by cells in the arterializing vein graft. Vein graft neointimal hyperplasia was reduced by reducing CXCR4 activity in vein graft-extrinsic cells, but not in vein graft-intrinsic cells: the rank order of neointimal hyperplasia was WT/WT \u2248 Cxcr4(-/+)/WT > WT/Cxcr4(-/+) \u2248 Cxcr4(-/+)/Cxcr4(-/+); CXCR4 deficiency in graft-extrinsic cells reduced neointimal hyperplasia by 39% to 47% (P < .05). Vein graft medial area was equivalent in all grafts except Cxcr4(-/+)/Cxcr4(-/+), in which the medial area was 60% \u00b1 20% greater (P < .05). Vein graft re-endothelialization was indistinguishable among all three vein graft groups. However, the prevalence of medial leukocytes was 40% \u00b1 10% lower in Cxcr4(-/+)/Cxcr4(-/+) than in WT/WT vein grafts (P < .05), and the prevalence of smooth muscle actin-positive cells was 45% \u00b1 20% higher (P < .05).\nWe conclude that CXCR4 contributes to vein graft neointimal hyperplasia through mechanisms that alter homing to the vein graft of graft-extrinsic cells, particularly leukocytes.\nThe utility of autologous vein grafts is severely reduced by neointimal hyperplasia, which accelerates subsequent graft atherosclerosis. Our study demonstrates that vein graft neointimal hyperplasia is aggravated by activity of the cell-surface \u201cCXC\u201d chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4), which is critical for recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells to sites of inflammation. Our model for CXCR4 deficiency used mice with heterozygous deficiency of Cxcr4. Consequently, our results suggest the possibility that a CXCR4 antagonist--like plerixafor, currently in clinical use--could be applied to vein grafts periadventitially, and perhaps achieve beneficial effects on vein graft neointimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the risk factors of incomplete thrombosis in the false lumen after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in patients with extensive acute type B aortic dissection.\nThis was a retrospective study at Zhongda Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, China. Between January 2005 and May 2008, patients with acute type B dissection who underwent TEVAR at two centers were reviewed and 124 who met the following criteria were included in this study: (1) dissection involving the aorta below the level of the celiac artery, (2) completely patent false lumen at the time of intervention, and (3) complete initial diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scans and all follow-up CT scans available. Exclusion criteria were (1) aortic dissection secondary to trauma, (2) intramural hematoma, and (3) Marfan patients. The main outcome measures were demographics, comorbidity profiles, technical details of procedures, anatomic characteristics of dissection, and false lumen status of thrombosis during follow-up. Ordinal regression analysis was performed with variables that reached P < .20 on univariate analysis to investigate independent risk factors of incomplete thrombosis in the false lumen.\nUnivariate analysis showed that the age at TEVAR, hypertension, maximum diameter of the abdominal aorta and false lumen at the abdominal level, re-entry tears, and visceral branches that arose partially or totally from the false lumen had a P < .20. Further analysis with an ordinal regression model showed that the visceral branches that arose partially or totally from the false lumen (odds ratio [OR], 10.054; P < .001), re-entry tears (OR, 30.661; P < .001), and maximum diameter of the false lumen on the abdominal aorta (OR, 1.265; P = .004) were the significant risk factors of incomplete thrombosis in the false lumen after TEVAR.\nVisceral branches that arose partially or totally from the false lumen, re-entry tears, and maximum diameter of the false lumen on the abdominal aorta were the risk factors of incomplete thrombosis in the false lumen after TEVAR in extensive acute type B dissection.",

    "abstract": "Risk prediction is important in medical management, especially to optimize patient management before surgical intervention. No quantitative risk scores or predictors are available for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Surgical risk and prognosis are usually based on anesthetic scores or clinical evaluation. We suggest that renal function is a better predictor of risk than other cardiovascular parameters. This study used the four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD-4)-calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to compare classical cardiovascular risk factors with prognosis and cardiovascular events of hospitalized PAD patients.\nThe study evaluated 204 patients who were admitted for vascular intervention and diagnosed with grade IIb, III, or IV PAD or with carotid or renal stenosis. Those with carotid or renal stenosis were excluded, leaving 188 patients who were randomized from 2004 to 2005 and monitored until 2010. We performed a life-table analysis with a 6-year follow-up period and one final checkpoint. The following risk factors were evaluated: age, sex, ischemic heart disease, ictus (as a manifestation of cerebrovascular disease related to systemic arterial disease), diabetes, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type of vascular intervention, and urea and creatinine plasma levels. The GFR was calculated using the MDRD-4 equation. Death, major cardiovascular events, and reintervention for arterial disease were recorded during the follow-up.\nPatients (73% men) were a mean age of 71.38 \u00b1 11.43 (standard deviation) years. PAD grade IIb was diagnosed in 41 (20%) and grade III-IV in 147 (72%). Forty-two minor amputations (20.6%), 21 major amputations (10.3%), and 102 revascularizations (50%) were performed. A major cardiovascular event occurred in 60 patients (29.4%), and 71 (34.8%) died. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the MDRD-4 GFR, age, and male sex were independent variables related to death and that the MDRD-4 GFR and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were related to major cardiovascular events. A statistically significant relationship was also found between serum creatinine levels and reintervention rates.\nThe MDRD-4 GFR was a better predictor of risk of death or infarction than classical cardiovascular risk factors in patients with PAD. This suggests that its routine use in the initial evaluation in patients with PAD is beneficial.",

    "abstract": "To assess technical feasibility and short-term outcome of a novel hypogastric preservation technique in patients with aortoiliac aneurysms using commercially available endografts without device modification.\nMulti-institution review of prospectively acquired database of patients undergoing double-barrel endograft repair of aortoiliac aneurysms.\nTwenty-two patients underwent endovascular aneurysm repair for aortoiliac aneurysms from 2010 to 2011, with 23 double-barrel hypogastric preservation procedures successfully completed in 21 patients. The technique involved bifurcated main body placement followed by simultaneous deployment of parallel endograft limbs into the external iliac (ipsilateral approach) and hypogastric (contralateral femoral or brachial approach) arteries. Bilateral hypogastric branches were performed in two patients, and unilateral branches with and without contralateral coil embolization were performed in nine and ten patients, respectively. Procedural success rate was 96%, technical success rate (successful implantation with immediate aneurysm exclusion and no observed endoleak) was 88%, and access was fully-percutaneous in 86%. Two type III endoleaks between branch components were noted on completion angiograms, but both resolved spontaneously on follow-up imaging. One type Ib endoleak was noted on postoperative imaging (contralateral to hypogastric branch, repaired with limb extension), as were three type II endoleaks (14%) without sac expansion. Early (<2 weeks) limb occlusion (one external iliac, two hypogastric) occurred in two patients, though no subsequent occlusions have occurred (mean follow-up, 7.2 months; range, 1-20 months). Primary patency for external iliac and hypogastric limbs at 6 months was 95% and 88%, respectively. There were no deaths; complications included groin hematoma in 10% and acute renal insufficiency in 5%. Buttock claudication (n = 4) only occurred in patients who had ipsilateral coil embolization of hypogastric arteries (n = 9) for bilateral iliac aneurysms in which only unilateral hypogastric preservation was performed, resulting in rate of 44% in these patients.\nThe double-barrel technique for hypogastric preservation is technically feasible across multiple interventionalists using commercially available endografts without device modification. These procedures are associated with minimal morbidity, acceptable short-term limb-patency rates, and reduced buttock claudication compared with those involving contralateral hypogastric embolization.",

    "results": "Twenty-two patients underwent endovascular aneurysm repair for aortoiliac aneurysms from 2010 to 2011, with 23 double-barrel hypogastric preservation procedures successfully completed in 21 patients. The technique involved bifurcated main body placement followed by simultaneous deployment of parallel endograft limbs into the external iliac (ipsilateral approach) and hypogastric (contralateral femoral or brachial approach) arteries. Bilateral hypogastric branches were performed in two patients, and unilateral branches with and without contralateral coil embolization were performed in nine and ten patients, respectively. Procedural success rate was 96%, technical success rate (successful implantation with immediate aneurysm exclusion and no observed endoleak) was 88%, and access was fully-percutaneous in 86%. Two type III endoleaks between branch components were noted on completion angiograms, but both resolved spontaneously on follow-up imaging. One type Ib endoleak was noted on postoperative imaging (contralateral to hypogastric branch, repaired with limb extension), as were three type II endoleaks (14%) without sac expansion. Early (<2 weeks) limb occlusion (one external iliac, two hypogastric) occurred in two patients, though no subsequent occlusions have occurred (mean follow-up, 7.2 months; range, 1-20 months). Primary patency for external iliac and hypogastric limbs at 6 months was 95% and 88%, respectively. There were no deaths; complications included groin hematoma in 10% and acute renal insufficiency in 5%.

The subsequent development or diagnosis of a TAA was noted and the association between AAA and TAA described.\nA total of 2196 patients with an AAA were reviewed. 1082 (49.3%) had a chest computed tomography (CT) during follow-up. 117 patients (10.8%) had a synchronous and 136 (12.6%) a metachronous TAA. Mean time to diagnosis was 2.3 years. Mean diameter was 4.7 \u00b1 1.4 cm for AAA, and 4.7 \u00b1 1.0 for TAA. Indications for the chest CT were variable. Most common were AAA (15%), pulmonary embolus (14%), and lung cancer (11%). Only 38% of AAAs and 14% of TAAs were repaired during the study period. Of all patients with known AAA who were found to have a TAA, 61/253 (24%) underwent repair, had a rupture, or had a TAA >5.5 cm.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the pathogenesis of arteriovenous (AV) fistula failure in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and tests the vascular protective effect of rosuvastatin on the fistulous communication of diabetic rats.\nDM was induced in rats by a single injection of streptozotocin. One week later, a fistula was created in the descending aorta and the adjacent inferior vena cava (aortocaval [AC] fistula). Rats were then randomly assigned to receive placebo or rosuvastatin (15 mg/kg/d) in chow for 2 weeks. Blood flow in the aortic segments of the fistula was measured. Circulating CD34+/KDR+ endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were determined 2 weeks after creation of the AC fistulas using flow cytometry. Vascular function of the AC fistulas was assessed by isometric force testing. The expression of proinflammatory genes and generation of superoxide anions in the fistulas were examined.\nThe number of EPCs was reduced in diabetic rats, and rosuvastatin significantly increased the number of circulating EPCs. Reduced blood flow and impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation in the AC fistula of animals with diabetes was significantly potentiated after treatment with rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin also attenuated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase and generation of superoxide anions in the fistula tissues isolated from diabetic rats.\nWe provide the first evidence demonstrating that rosuvastatin improves blood flow and endothelial function of AC fistulas in rats with DM by attenuating the activity of proinflammatory genes and generation of superoxide anions in the remodeled vasculature.\nArteriovenous (AV) fistula is the most common vascular access for hemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease. Studies have shown that blood flow in the AV fistula is significantly reduced in patients with diabetes and the period for maturation of an AV fistula is longer in these patients. The underlying mechanisms of AV fistula failure in diabetes are still poorly understood and there are limited therapeutic approaches that can increase the lifespan of these fistulas. The present study demonstrates that oral administration rosuvastatin improves blood flow and endothelial function of AC fistulas in rats with diabetes, which results from attenuating the activity of proinflammatory genes in the remodeled vasculature, thereby reducing the generation of tissue superoxide anions. Our results may thus enhance our ability to prevent and manage vascular access failure in patients with diabetes with chronic renal disease.",

    "abstract": "Blunt injury to the descending thoracic aorta is a potentially life-threatening condition necessitating rapid assessment and possible surgical intervention. The purpose of this study was to review outcomes of patients who sustained blunt thoracic aortic injury at a single institution.\nOur institutional Trauma Registry Database was searched for patients who sustained acute blunt descending thoracic aortic injury between July 1990 and July 2010. Individual injuries, anatomic and physiological measures of injury severity, and operative and hospital mortality were compared between patients undergoing open surgical and thoracic endovascular aortic repair. Additionally, aortic injury grade, management, and outcomes were reviewed for patients who did not undergo an aortic intervention.\nOf the 100 patients identified over the 20-year study period, 60 (60%) underwent conventional open repair, 26 (26%) underwent endovascular repair, and 14 (14%) did not undergo an aortic intervention. The overall hospital mortality rate for the entire patient cohort was 34%. Of the 14 patients who did not undergo an aortic intervention, five (36%) were successfully medically managed and four (80%) of these had grade I aortic injuries. One of the successfully medically managed patients required endovascular repair 9 months after injury. Four medically managed patients expired as a result of aortic rupture within 1 to 2.5 hours of presentation. Two expired immediately after diagnosis, and the other two could have potentially been treated with improvements in transfer and diagnosis times. Age, individual injuries, and measures of injury severity were similar between patients undergoing open surgical or endovascular repair. Patients who underwent endovascular repair experienced a significantly lower intraoperative (0% vs 18%; P < .05) and overall hospital mortality (12% vs 37%; P < .05). Additionally, endovascular repair was associated with reductions in operative time, estimated blood loss, and intraoperative blood transfusions. Five endovascular patients required secondary interventions to treat endograft-related complications, including malapposition to the aortic arch (n = 3), midendograft stenosis (n = 1), and left upper extremity ischemia (n = 1).\nBlunt thoracic aortic injury to the descending thoracic aorta is associated with a high overall hospital mortality. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair is associated with significantly lower operative times, procedural blood loss, intraoperative blood transfusion, as well as intraoperative and overall hospital mortality compared with conventional open surgical repair. Consideration of this form of therapy as the initial form of treatment is warranted in anatomically acceptable candidates.",

    "abstract": "To compare the safety and efficacy of coil embolization (COIL) to Amplatzer vascular plug embolization (PLUG) to achieve internal iliac artery (IIA) occlusion prior to endovascular aortiliac aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nData from consecutive patients who underwent IIA embolization prior to EVAR over a 6-year period (2004-2010) were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, treatment modalities, and outcomes were compared.\nFrom January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2010, a total of 53 patients underwent percutaneous embolization of 57 IIAs prior to EVAR. Twenty-nine IIAs underwent COIL and 28 IIAs underwent PLUG embolization. Patient demographics and risk factors were similar between the two groups. Patients underwent repair for aneurysmal dilation of the infrarenal aorta in conjunction with the common or internal iliac arteries (n = 35, 62%) or isolated iliac artery aneurysms (n = 19, 38%). A significantly greater number of embolization devices were used in the COIL group (5.8 \u00b1 3.8 vs 1.1 \u00b1 0.4; P < .0001). Patients undergoing PLUG embolization demonstrated significantly shorter procedure times (118.4 \u00b1 64.7 minutes vs 72.6 \u00b1 22.4 minutes; P = .008) and fluoroscopy times (32.6 \u00b1 14.6 vs 14.4 \u00b1 8.6 minutes; P = .002). However, radiation dose between the groups did not differ (COIL: 470,192.7 \u00b1 190,606.6 vs PLUG: 300,972.2 \u00b1 191,815.7 mGycm(2); P = .10). Overall periprocedural morbidity did not differ between the groups (COIL: 11% vs PLUG: 6%; P = 1.0), and there were no perioperative mortalities or severe complications. Nontarget embolization occurred in two COIL and no PLUG cases (COIL: 6.9% vs PLUG: 0%; P = .49). Patient-reported buttock claudication at 1 month was 17.2% for COIL and 39.3% for PLUG patients (P = .08). At last follow-up, persistent buttock claudication was reported in 13.8% of COIL and in 14.3% of PLUG embolizations (P = 1.0). There was no significant difference in charges for the embolization material, operating room, or overall hospital charges (COIL: 44,720 \u00b1 19,153 vs 37,367 \u00b1 10,915; P = .22). Lastly, zero endoleaks in the COIL group and three in the PLUG group (P = .40) were detected on the most recent follow-up computed tomography imaging. No endoleak was related to the site of IIA embolization.\nCOIL and PLUG embolization both provide effective IIA embolization with low complication rates when used for EVAR. Buttock claudication did occur in approximately one-third of patients but resolved in half of those affected. PLUG embolization took significantly less time to perform and required decreased fluoroscopy times. Based on outcomes and cost-analysis, COIL and PLUG embolization are equivalent methods to achieve IIA occlusion during EVAR.",

Patients undergoing PLUG embolization demonstrated significantly shorter procedure times (118.4 \u00b1 64.7 minutes vs 72.6 \u00b1 22.4 minutes; P = .008) and fluoroscopy times (32.6 \u00b1 14.6 vs 14.4 \u00b1 8.6 minutes; P = .002). However, radiation dose between the groups did not differ (COIL: 470,192.7 \u00b1 190,606.6 vs PLUG: 300,972.2 \u00b1 191,815.7 mGycm(2); P = .10). Overall periprocedural morbidity did not differ between the groups (COIL: 11% vs PLUG: 6%; P = 1.0), and there were no perioperative mortalities or severe complications. Nontarget embolization occurred in two COIL and no PLUG cases (COIL: 6.9% vs PLUG: 0%; P = .49). Patient-reported buttock claudication at 1 month was 17.2% for COIL and 39.3% for PLUG patients (P = .08). At last follow-up, persistent buttock claudication was reported in 13.8% of COIL and in 14.3% of PLUG embolizations (P = 1.0). There was no significant difference in charges for the embolization material, operating room, or overall hospital charges (COIL: 44,720 \u00b1 19,153 vs 37,367 \u00b1 10,915; P = .22). Lastly, zero endoleaks in the COIL group and three in the PLUG group (P = .40) were detected on the most recent follow-up computed tomography imaging. No endoleak was related to the site of IIA embolization.",

    "abstract": "To assess the influence of stent application on in-stent hemodynamics under standardized conditions.\nOvine common carotid arteries before and after stent (6 \u00d7 40 mm, sinus-Carotid-RXt, combined open-closed cell design; Optimed, Ettlingen, Germany) application were used. Plastic tubes, 10 mm in length, simulating stenosis were placed in the middle of the applied stent to induce different degrees of stenosis (moderate 57.8% and severe 76.4%). Flow velocity and dynamic compliance were, respectively, measured with ultrasound and laser scan; proximal, in-stent, and distal to the stented arterial segment (1 cm proximal and distal) in a pulsatile ex vivo circulation system.\nStent insertion caused the in-stent peak systolic velocity to increase 22% without stenosis, 31% with moderate stenosis, and 23% with severe stenosis. Stent insertion without stenosis caused no significant increase in in-stent end-diastolic velocity (EDV) but a 17% increase with moderate stenosis. In severe stenosis, EDV was increased 56% proximal to the stenosis. Compliance was reduced threefold in the middle of the stented arterial segment where flow velocity was significantly increased.\nWith or without stenosis, stent introduction caused the in-stent peak systolic velocity to become significantly elevated compared with a nonstented area. EDV was also increased by stent insertion in the case of moderate stenosis. The stent-induced compliance reduction may be causal for the increase in flow velocity since the stent-induced flow velocity elevation appeared in the stented area with low compliance. Because of altered hemodynamics caused by stent introduction when measured by duplex ultrasound, caution is prudent in concluding that carotid artery stenting is associated with a higher restenosis rate than carotid endarterectomy. Mistakenly upgrading moderate to severe restenosis could result in unnecessary reintervention.\nClinical experience and prior studies support the supposition that restenosis after carotid artery stenting in carotid lesions displays erroneously elevated velocity when evaluated by duplex ultrasound (DUS), thus contributing to misleading interpretation of the degree of stenosis. This study, in contrast to studies of other groups, employs exactly the same conditions to measure flow with DUS in an unstented and then stented section of the carotid artery. Since DUS is the first-choice tool for carotid artery evaluation, knowledge about inexactness of the method is essential to avoid errors in treatment or follow-up decisions.",

    "abstract": "The present randomized double-blind multicenter study was designed to assess the efficacy of a progressive compressive stocking (new concept with maximal pressure at calf), compared to a degressive compressive stocking graded 30 mm Hg, evaluating the improvement of lower leg symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) in ambulatory patients with moderate to severe chronic venous disease.\nBoth gender outpatients presenting symptomatic moderate to severe CVI were eligible for a treatment by compressive stockings. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either degressive compressive stockings (30 mm Hg at ankle, 21 mm Hg at upper calf) or progressive compressive stockings (10 mm Hg at ankle, 23 mm Hg at upper calf). The primary outcome, evaluated after 3 months, was a composite success outcome, including improvement of pain or heavy legs without onset of either ulcer, deep or superficial vein thrombosis of the lower limbs, or pulmonary embolism. The ease of application of the compressive stockings reported by patients was one of secondary outcome.\nOverall, 401 patients (199 in the progressive compressive stocking group and 202 in the degressive compressive stocking group) were randomized by 44 angiologists in France. Among them, 66% were classified in the C3 CEAP category. The rate of success was significantly higher in the progressive compressive stocking group compared to the degressive compressive stocking group (70.0% vs 59.6%; relative risk, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.37; P = .03). This was mainly due to more frequent symptom improvement in the progressive compressive stocking group. The compressive stockings were considered easy to apply by 81.3% of patients in the progressive compressive stocking group vs 49.7% of patients in the degressive compressive stocking group (P < .0001). The rate of related serious adverse events was low and similar in both groups.\nThis trial has demonstrated that progressive compressive stockings are more effective than usual degressive compressive stockings in the improvement of pain and lower leg symptoms in patients with CVI. Moreover, progressive compressive stockings were easier to apply, raising no safety concern at 3 months.",

The purpose of this study was to compare gender-specific early outcomes after endovascular aneurysm repair using a large international registry.\nOver the 2-year period ending in 2011, 1,262 patients (131 women, 10.4%; 1,131 men, 89.6%) with infrarenal aneurysms treated with the Endurant stent graft were prospectively enrolled in the ENGAGE registry and followed clinically and radiographically.\nWomen were older (75.5\u00a0\u00b1 7.0 vs 72.8\u00a0\u00b1 8.1; P\u00a0= .0003) and had smaller aneurysms (57.8\u00a0\u00b1 9.5 vs 60.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.9\u00a0mm; P\u00a0= .01).

More women had an infrarenal neck angle >60\u00b0 (19.2% vs 9.1%; P\u00a0= .001). Technical success was achieved in equal numbers of women and men (97.7% vs 99.2%; P\u00a0= .10).

At the 1-month follow-up, there were no differences between women and men with respect to endograft occlusion (2.5% vs 1.9%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.70), and differences observed in any endoleak (17.2% vs 11.4%; P\u00a0= .08) and type I endoleaks (3.3% vs 1.2%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.08) did not reach statistical significance.

Survival at 30 days (100% vs 98.6%) and 1 year (92.5% vs 91.6%; P\u00a0= .99) was similar for women and men.\nThis large multinational registry confirms the previously observed prevalence of suboptimal neck anatomy in women. Even though women have shorter and more angulated infrarenal necks, their technical outcomes at 30 days and clinical outcomes at 1 year were similar to those of men. Much longer follow-up is necessary to determine whether these outcomes proved durable.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to review retrospectively the records of patients treated with carotid artery stenting (CAS) to investigate the potential correlations between clinical variables, distal protection filter (DPF) type and characteristics, and 30-day peri-/postprocedural outcomes.\nThis is a multicenter, single-arm, nonrandomized retrospective study of patients who underwent filter-protected CAS in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, region between July 2000 and May 2011. Analysis of peri-/postprocedural complications included myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), stroke, death, and a composition of all adverse events (AEs). Filter characteristics for Accunet (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, Calif; n\u00a0= 429 [58.8%]), Angioguard (Cordis Endovascular, Miami Lakes, Fla; n\u00a0= 114 [15.6%]), FilterWire (Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass; n\u00a0= 113 [15.5%]), Spider (ev3 Endovascular, Plymouth, Minn; n\u00a0= 45 [6.2%]), and Emboshield (Abbott Vascular; n\u00a0= 24 [3.3%]) were previously determined in\u00a0vitro and were used to find correlations with CAS procedural outcomes. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, as well as goodness-of-fit tests to find multivariate correlations with procedural outcomes.\nIn total, 731 CAS procedures using six different DPFs were analyzed. Peri-/postprocedural AEs included 19 TIAs (2.6%), 38 strokes (5.2%), one myocardial infarction (0.1%), 19 deaths (3.6%), and a total of 61 patients with complications (8.3%). Univariate analysis for filter design characteristics showed that the composite of AE was negatively associated with\u00a0both vascular resistance (P\u00a0= .01) and eccentricity (P\u00a0= .02) and was positively associated with porosity (P\u00a0= .0007), number of pores (P\u00a0= .005), and pore density (P\u00a0= .001). Multivariate analysis and the goodness-of-fit test revealed that\u00a0patients with a history of congestive heart failure, stroke, and TIA (each with odds ratio >1) led to a good-fit model P\u00a0value of .72 for peri-/postprocedural AEs. Multivariate analysis was inconclusive for all filter design characteristics.\nThe following filter design characteristics are independently significant for minimizing peri-/postprocedural AEs: higher vascular resistance, concentric in shape, greater capture efficiency, lower porosity, lower number of pores, and lower pore density. Lower porosity and smaller wall apposition were also found to be independently significant for minimization of peri-/postprocedural TIAs. This information can be used when considering the desirable design characteristics of future DPFs.).",

    "abstract": "Chronic renal failure (CRF) is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, and medial vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) hypertrophy, proliferation, and calcification play a pivotal role in uremic vasculopathy. Glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) facilitates the transport of glucose into VSMCs, and GLUT1 overexpression associated with high glucose influx leads to a stimulation of VSMC proliferation. However, the role of GLUT1 in uremic vasculopathy remains unclear. This study aimed to identify changes in the expression of GLUT1 in VSMCs in the setting of experimental uremia and investigate whether Akt/tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 2 (TSC2)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/ribosomal S6 protein kinase (S6K) signaling, which plays a crucial role in VSMC proliferation and glucose metabolism, is involved in the regulation of GLUT1 expression.\nIn vivo experimental CRF was induced in Wistar rats by 5/6 nephrectomy, and the GLUT1 expression in aortic tissue was determined by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemical staining. Indoxyl sulfate (IS) is a uremic retention solute proven with pro-proliferative effect on rat VSMCs, and we further studied the expression of GLUT1 in rat A7r5 rat embryonic aortic cells stimulated by IS in the presence or absence of phloretin, a GLUT1 inhibitor, to explore the pathogenic role of GLUT1 in uremic vasculopathy. The contribution of Akt/TSC2/mTOR/S6K signaling in modifying the GLUT1 expression was also assessed.\nEight weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy, aortic tissue obtained from CRF rats exhibited increased wall thickness and VSMC hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and degeneration. Compared with the sham-operated control group, the messenger (m)RNA and protein abundance of GLUT1 were both markedly increased in CRF rats. In vitro, IS induced a significant increase in expression of GLUT1 protein as well as pro-proliferative cyclin D1 and p21 mRNA and a modest increase in expression of antiapoptotic p53 mRNA in A7r5 cells, whereas inhibition of GLUT1 mediated glucose influx reduced the pro-proliferative and antiapoptotic effects of IS. In addition to increased GLUT1 expression, IS significantly suppressed Akt and TSC2 phosphorylation after 6-hour and 12-hour treatment, but increased S6K phosphorylation after 3-hour treatment. Inactivation of mTOR downstream signaling by rapamycin treatment inhibited S6K phosphorylation and abolished the stimulatory effect of IS on GLUT1 expression.\nIn vivo and in vitro experimental CRF displayed prominent GLUT1 upregulation in VSMCs. The uremic toxin IS stimulated proliferation of VSMCs possibly through induction of GLUT1 expression. The Akt/TSC/mTOR/S6K signaling pathway may be one of the mechanisms underlying the upregulation of GLUT1 expression in uremic VSMCs.",

    "abstract": "Outcomes in the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST) did not differ between carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for the composite primary end point of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), or death during the periprocedural period or ipsilateral stroke within 4 years. Rigorous credentialing and training of interventionists, including vascular surgeons, were required for the randomization phase of CREST. Because the lead-in phase of CREST had suggested higher perioperative risks after CAS performed by vascular surgeons, the purpose of this analysis was to examine differences in outcomes after randomization between CAS and CEA performed by vascular surgeons.\nCREST is a prospective randomized controlled trial with blinded end point adjudication. Vascular surgeons performed 237 (21%) of the CAS procedures and 765 (65%) of the CEA procedures among 2320 patients who received their assigned treatment. Proportional hazards analyses were used to estimate the relative efficacy of CAS vs CEA for the\u00a0composite primary end point and also for stroke and death.\nAmong 2502 randomized patients, 1321 (53%) were symptomatic and 1181 (47%) were asymptomatic. For procedures performed exclusively by vascular surgeons, the primary end point did not differ between CAS and CEA at 4-year follow-up (6.2% vs 5.6%, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-2.41; P\u00a0= .41) In this subgroup, the periprocedural stroke and death rates were higher after CAS than CEA for symptomatic patients (6.1% vs 1.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.01). Asymptomatic patients also had slightly higher stroke and death rates after CAS (2.6% vs 1.1%; P\u00a0= .20), although\u00a0this difference did not reach statistical significance. Conversely, cranial nerve injuries (0.0% vs 5.0%; P\u00a0< .001) were less\u00a0frequent\u00a0after CAS than CEA. The MI rates were slightly lower after CAS (1.3% vs 2.6%; P\u00a0= .24). In performing CAS, vascular surgeons\u00a0had outcomes for the periprocedural primary end point comparable to the outcomes of all interventionists (HR, 0.99;\u00a095% CI, 0.50-2.00) after adjusting for age, sex, and symptomatic status. Vascular surgeons also had similar results after CEA for the periprocedural primary end point compared with other surgeons (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.42-1.27).\nWhen performed by surgeons, CAS and CEA have similar net outcomes, although the periprocedural risks\u00a0vary (lower stroke with CEA and lower MI with CAS). These data suggest that appropriately trained vascular surgeons may safely offer both CEA and CAS for the prevention of stroke. The remarkably low stroke and death rates after CEA\u00a0performed by vascular surgeons in CREST, particularly among symptomatic patients, represent the best outcomes ever reported after carotid interventions from a randomized controlled trial.

    "abstract": "An increasing number of abdominal aortic aneurysms with unfavorable proximal neck anatomy are treated with standard endograft devices. Skepticism exists with regard to the safety and efficacy of this practice.\nA systematic review of the literature was undertaken to identify all studies comparing the outcomes of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in patients with hostile and friendly infrarenal neck anatomy. Hostile neck conditions were defined as conditions that were not consistent with the instructions for use of the endograft devices employed in the selected studies. Outcome data were pooled, and combined overall effect sizes were calculated using fixed or random effects models.\nSeven observational studies reporting on 1559 patients (hostile anatomy group, 714 patients; friendly anatomy group, 845 patients) were included. Patients with hostile anatomy required an increased number of adjunctive procedures to achieve proximal seal compared with patients with friendly anatomy (odds ratio [OR], 3.050; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.884-4.938). Although patients with unfavorable neck anatomy had an increased risk of developing 30-day morbidity (OR, 2.278; 95% CI, 1.025-5.063), no significant differences in the incidence of type I endoleak and reintervention rates within 30 days of treatment between the two groups were identified (OR, 2.467 and 1.082; 95% CI, 0.562-10.823 and 0.096-12.186).

All data were collected prospectively. Patients were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis, and outcomes were evaluated by a logistic regression multivariable model. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare long-term survival.\nThe EVAR patients had a significantly lower 30-day mortality than did the OSR patients (29/120 [24.2%] vs 72/163 [44.2%]; P\u00a0< .005) and better cumulative 5-year survival (37% vs 26%; P\u00a0< .005). Men benefited more from EVAR (mortality: 20.9% for EVAR vs 44.3% for OSR; P\u00a0< .001) than did women (mortality: 32.4% vs 43.9%; P\u00a0= .39). Age \u226580 years was a significant predictor of death for EVAR (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; P\u00a0= .003) but not for OSR (OR, 1.04; P\u00a0= .056). Preexisting hypertension was a significant predictor of survival for both EVAR (OR, 0.17; P\u00a0< .001) and OSR (OR, 0.48; P\u00a0= .021). Almost one fourth of EVAR patients (21/91 [23.1%]) required secondary interventions. Survival advantage was maintained for EVAR patients to 5 years.\nFor r-AAA, EVAR reduces the 30-day mortality and improves long-term survival up to 5 years. However, whereas open survivors require few graft-related interventions, up to 23% of EVAR patients will require reintervention for endoleaks or graft migration. Close follow-up of all EVAR survivors is mandatory.",

    "abstract": "To survey the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) membership with regard to practice trends related to work effort, employment status, practice ownership, endovascular cases, and anticipated changes in practice in the near future.\nA survey questionnaire was developed to gather information about member demographics and practice, hours worked, full-time (FT) or part-time status, employment status, practice ownership, competition for referrals, proportion of endovascular vs open procedures, and anticipated changes in practice in the next 3 years. We used SurveyMonkey and distributed the survey to all active vascular surgeon (VS) members of the SVS.\nThe response rate was 207 of 2230 (10.7%). Two thirds were in private practice, and 21% were in solo practice. Twenty-four percent were employed by hospitals/health systems. Those VS under the age of 50 years were more likely to exclusively practice vascular surgery compared with VS over the age of 50 years (P\u00a0= .0003). Sixty-eight of the physicians (32.7%) were between 50 and 59 years old, 186 (90.3%) were men, 192 (92.8%) worked FT (>36 hours of patient care per week), and almost two thirds worked >60 hours per week.

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) has been associated with skeletal muscle pathology, including atrophy of the affected muscles. In addition, oxidative metabolism is impaired, muscle function is reduced, and gait and mobility are restricted. We hypothesized that greater severity of symptomatic PAD would be associated with lower levels of muscle mass, strength, and endurance, and that these musculoskeletal abnormalities in turn would impair functional performance and walking ability in patients with PAD.\nWe assessed 22 persons with intermittent claudication from PAD in this cross-sectional pilot study. Outcome assessments included initial claudication distance and absolute claudication distance via treadmill protocols and outcomes from the 6-minute walk (6MW). Secondary outcomes included one repetition maximum strength/endurance testing of hip extensors, hip abductors, quadriceps, hamstrings, plantar flexors, pectoral, and upper back muscle groups, as well as performance-based tests of function. Univariate and stepwise multiple regression models were constructed to evaluate relationships and are presented.\nTwenty-two participants (63.6% male; mean [standard deviation] age, 73.6 [8.2] years; range, 55-85 years) were studied. Mean (standard deviation) resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0.54 ([0.13]; range, 0.28-0.82), and participants ranged from having mild claudication to rest pain. Lower resting ABI was significantly associated with reduced bilateral hip extensor strength (r = 0.54; P = .007) and reduced whole body strength (r = 0.32; P = .05). In addition, lower ABI was associated with a shorter distance to first stop during the 6MW (r = 0.38; P = .05) and poorer single leg balance (r = 0.44; P = .03). Reduced bilateral hip extensor strength was also significantly associated with functional outcomes, including reduced 6MW distance to first stop (r = 0.74; P = .001), reduced 6MW distance (r = 0.75; P < .001), and reduced total short physical performance battery score (worse function; r = 0.75; P = .003).\nOur results suggest the existence of a causal pathway from a reduction in ABI to muscle atrophy and weakness, to whole body disability represented by claudication outcomes and performance-based tests of functional mobility in an older cohort with symptomatic PAD. Longitudinal outcomes from this study and future trials are required to investigate the effects of an anabolic intervention targeting the muscles involved in mobility and activities of daily living and whether an increase in muscle strength will improve symptoms of claudication and lead to improvements in other functional outcomes in patients with PAD.",

    "abstract": "The treatment goals of access-related hand ischemia (ARHI) are to reverse symptoms and salvage the access. Many procedures have been described, but the optimal treatment strategy remains unresolved. In an effort to guide clinical decision making, this study was undertaken to document our outcomes for distal revascularization and interval ligation (DRIL) and to identify predictors of bypass patency and patient mortality.\nA retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent DRIL at the University of Florida from 2002 to 2011. Diagnosis of ARHI was based primarily upon clinical symptoms with noninvasive studies used to corroborate in equivocal cases. Patient demographics, procedure-outcome variables, and reinterventions were recorded. Bypass patency and mortality were estimated using cumulative incidence and Kaplan-Meier methodology, respectively. Cumulative incidence and Cox regression analysis were performed to determine predictors of bypass patency and mortality, respectively.\nA total of 134 DRILs were performed in 126 patients (mean [standard deviation] age, 57 [12] years) following brachial artery-based access. The postoperative complication rate was 27% (19% wound), and 30-day mortality was 2%. The wrist-brachial index and digital brachial index increased 0.31 (0.25) and 0.25 (0.29), respectively. Symptoms resolved in 82% of patients, and 85% continued to use their access. Cumulative incidences (\u00b1 standard error of the mean) of loss of primary and primary-assisted patency rates were 5%\u00a0\u00b1 2% and 4%\u00a0\u00b1 2% at 1 year and 22%\u00a0\u00b1 5% and 18%\u00a0\u00b1 5% at 5 years, respectively, with mean follow-up of 14.8 months. Univariate predictors of primary patency failure were DRIL complications (odds ratio [OR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-8.9; P\u00a0= .02), configuration other than brachiobasilic/brachiocephalic autogenous access (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.4-8.3; P\u00a0= .009), and two or more prior access attempts (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.6-10.4; P\u00a0= .004). Brachiocephalic access configuration (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.04-0.8; P\u00a0=\u00a0.02) and autogenous vein conduit (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.06-0.58; P\u00a0= .004) were predictors of improved bypass patency. All-cause mortality was 28% and 79% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. Multivariable predictors of mortality were age >40 (hazard ratio [HR], 8.3; 95% CI, 2.5-33.3; P\u00a0= .0004), grade 3 ischemia (HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-4.6; P\u00a0= .0008), complication from DRIL (HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.5; P\u00a0= .004), and smoking history (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-4; P\u00a0=\u00a0.007). Patients with no prior access attempts had lower predicted mortality (HR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9; P\u00a0= .02).\nThe DRIL procedure effectively improves distal perfusion and reverses the symptoms of ARHI while salvaging the access, but the long-term survival of these patients is poor. Given the poor survival, preoperative risk stratification is critical. Patients at high risk for DRIL failure and mortality may be best served with alternate remedial procedures.",

The postoperative complication rate was 27% (19% wound), and 30-day mortality was 2%. The wrist-brachial index and digital brachial index increased 0.31 (0.25) and 0.25 (0.29), respectively. Symptoms resolved in 82% of patients, and 85% continued to use their access. Cumulative incidences (\u00b1 standard error of the mean) of loss of primary and primary-assisted patency rates were 5%\u00a0\u00b1 2% and 4%\u00a0\u00b1 2% at 1 year and 22%\u00a0\u00b1 5% and 18%\u00a0\u00b1 5% at 5 years, respectively, with mean follow-up of 14.8 months. Univariate predictors of primary patency failure were DRIL complications (odds ratio [OR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-8.9; P\u00a0= .02), configuration other than brachiobasilic/brachiocephalic autogenous access (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.4-8.3; P\u00a0= .009), and two or more prior access attempts (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.6-10.4; P\u00a0= .004).

    "abstract": "Among patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, carotid artery stenting (CAS) is associated with a higher risk of periprocedural stroke or death than carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Uncertainty remains whether the balance of risk changes with time since the most recent ischemic event.\nWe investigated the association of time between the qualifying ischemic event and treatment (0-7 days, 8-14 days, and >14 days) with the risk of stroke or death within 30 days after CAS or CEA in a pooled analysis of data from individual patients randomized in the Endarterectomy vs Angioplasty in Patients with Symptomatic Severe Carotid Stenosis (EVA-3S) trial, the Stent-Protected Angioplasty versus Carotid Endarterectomy (SPACE) trial, and the International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS). Data were analyzed with a fixed-effect binomial regression model adjusted for source trial.\nInformation on time of qualifying event was available for 2839 patients. In the first 30 days after intervention, any stroke or death occurred significantly more often in the CAS group (110/1434 [7.7%]) compared with the CEA group (54/1405 [3.8%]; crude risk ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.7). Patients undergoing CEA within the first 7 days of the qualifying event had the lowest periprocedural stroke or death rate (3/106 [2.8%]). Patients treated with CAS in the same period had a 9.4% risk of periprocedural stroke or death (13/138; risk ratio CAS vs CEA: 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-11.8; adjusted for age, sex, and type of qualifying event). Patients treated between 8 and 14 days showed a periprocedural stroke or death rate of 3.4% (7/208) and 8.1% (19/234), respectively, for CEA and CAS. The latest treatment group had 4% complications in the CEA group (44/1091) and 7.3% in the CAS group (78/1062).\nThe increase in risk of CAS compared with CEA appears to be greatest in patients treated within 7 days of symptoms. Early surgery might remain most effective in stroke prevention in patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Chimney grafts have proven useful for urgent endovascular repair of juxtarenal aortic aneurysms. Stenting of juxtarenal aortic occlusive disease is not routinely advocated due to the risk of visceral artery obstruction. We report on the potential applicability of chimney grafts in 10 patients with juxtarenal aortic stenosis or occlusion. To our best knowledge, chimney grafts have not been applied previously in this challenging setting.\nTen high-risk female patients (mean age, 68 years) with severe stenosis or occlusion of the aorta at the level of the visceral arteries were offered stenting. \"Chimney\" stents or stent grafts (20-40 mm long) were implanted from a brachial approach into visceral arteries that needed to be covered by the aortic stent. The chimney stents were then temporarily obstructed by balloon catheters to prevent visceral embolization until the aortic stent or stent graft was deployed.\nAll procedures were technically successful, and patency was obtained in all visceral arteries and the aorta without distal embolization. One patient died after 9 days of acute heart failure. The nine surviving patients presented no complications, and all stented vessels remained patent at up to 6 years. Another patient died after 5.5 years due to lung cancer. All three patients with renal impairment have improved renal function, and a reduction in antihypertensive medication has been possible.\nChimney grafts may allow stenting of juxtarenal aortic occlusive disease by protecting the patency of visceral arteries. Further evaluation with more patients and longer follow-up is required.",

    "abstract": "Vertebral artery injury (VAI) associated with cervical trauma is being increasingly recognized with more aggressive screening. Disparate results from previous literature have led to uncertainty of the significance, natural history, and optimal therapy for VAI.\nTo understand the natural history and treatment outcomes from our experience, we performed a retrospective, single-center review from a level I trauma center for the previous 10 years of all VAI. Injuries were identified from search of an administrative trauma database, a resident-run working database, and all radiology dictations for the same period. All VAI were classified according to segmental involvement, Denver grading scale, and laterality. Analysis of associated injuries, demographics, neurologic outcome, mortality, length of stay, treatment plan, and follow-up imaging was also performed.\nFifty-one patients with VAI were identified from 2001 to 2011 from a total of 36,942 trauma admissions (0.13% incidence). Associated injuries were significant with an average New Injury Severity Score of 29.6. Penetrating trauma occurred in 14%. Cervical spine fracture was present in 88% with VAI. Diagnosis was obtained with computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in 95%. Screening was prompted by injury pattern or high-risk mechanism in all cases. Injuries classified according to the Denver grading scale were grade I = 24%, grade II = 35%, grade III = 4%, grade IV = 35%, and grade V = 2%. Distribution across segments included V1 = 18%, V2 = 67%, V3 = 31%, and V4 = 6%. Only one posterior circulation stroke was attributable to VAI. Overall mortality was 8%, with each mortality being associated with significant other organ injuries. Treatment rendered for VAI was antiplatelet therapy (50%), observation (31%), warfarin (17%), and stent (2%). There were no significant differences between treatment groups on any variable with the exception of body mass index (P = .047). Follow-up was obtained for 13% (n = 6) of survivors. The CTA demonstrated injury stability in four patients and resolution in two patients. Accuracy of the administrative trauma database was 53% compared with 96% for the resident-run working database.\nNeurologic sequelae attributable to VAI were rare. Grade of VAI or vertebral artery segment did not correlate with morbidity. We did not observe any differences in short-term outcomes between systemic anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. Of those patients seen at follow-up, injury resolution or stability was documented by CTA. A conservative approach with either observation or antithrombotic therapy is suggested. If the natural history of VAI includes a very low stroke rate, then therapies with a lower therapeutic index, such as systemic anticoagulation, in the severely injured trauma patient are not supported. Our search strategy urges awareness of the limitations of administrative databases for retrospective vascular study.",

    "abstract": "Because of the prolonged healing time of diabetic foot ulcers, methods for identifying ways to expedite the ulcer healing process are needed. The angiosome concept delineates the body into three-dimensional blocks of tissue fed by specific source arteries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefit of infrapopliteal endovascular revascularization guided by an angiosome model of perfusion in the healing process of diabetic foot ulcers.\nA total of 250 consecutive legs with diabetic foot ulcers in 226 patients who had undergone infrapopliteal endovascular revascularization in a single center were evaluated. Patient records and periprocedural leg angiograms were reviewed. The legs were divided into two groups depending on whether direct arterial flow to the site of the foot ulcer based on the angiosome concept was achieved (direct group) or not achieved (indirect group). Ulcer healing time was compared between the two groups. A propensity score was used for adjustment of differences in pretreatment covariables in multivariate analysis and for 1:1 matching.\nDirect flow to the angiosome feeding the ulcer area was achieved in 121 legs (48%) compared with indirect revascularization in 129 legs. Foot ulcers treated with angiosome-targeted infrapopliteal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty healed better. The ulcer healing rate was mean (standard deviation) 72% (5%) at 12 months for the direct group compared with\u00a045% (6%) for the indirect group (P < .001). When adjusted for propensity score, the direct group still had a significantly better ulcer healing rate than the indirect group (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-2.90; P\u00a0=\u00a0.001).\nAttaining a direct arterial flow based on the angiosome model of perfusion to the foot ulcer appears to be important for ulcer healing in diabetic patients.",

    "abstract": "The use of bone marrow cells (BMCs) in therapeutic angiogenesis has been studied extensively. However, the critical paracrine effects of this treatment are still unclear. Therefore, we studied autotransfusable cells that produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), especially VEGF-C.\nMale C57BL/6 mice with hind limb ischemia were administered intramuscular injections of phosphate-buffered saline as controls, or unsorted BMCs, sorted CD11b(+), or CD11b(-) cells from BMCs, and recombinant VEGF-C. To evaluate the treatments, perfusion was measured by laser Doppler scanning performed on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. A functional assay was performed in parallel, with mice traversing an enclosed walkway. Capillary density was determined by directly counting vessels stained positive with von Willebrand factor at individual time points. Lymphangiogenesis was assessed by LYVE-1 positive cells.\nPostischemic recovery of hind limb perfusion significantly improved in BMC, CD11b(+), and VEGF-C treatment groups compared with the control groups, as assessed by laser Doppler scanning. On early operative days 1 and 3, the blood flow recovery ratio was higher in the CD11b(+)-treated group compared with BMC and VEGF-C treatment groups. In the functional assay, the VEGF-C group dramatically recovered compared with the control group. The capillary/myofiber ratio in the thigh muscle and number of LYVE-1 positive cells was higher in the CD11b(+) and VEGF-C groups than in controls. Furthermore, expression of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF receptor messenger ribonucleic acid and protein was observed in CD11b(+) cells.\nThe VEGF-C derived from CD11b(+) cells play a critical role in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in a murine model of hind limb ischemia. Consequently, treatment with self-CD11b(+) cells accelerated recovery from ischemia and may be a promising therapeutic strategy for peripheral arterial disease patients.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has become an attractive and well-accepted option for the management of the various thoracic aortic pathologies that vascular surgeons are confronted with. As in the abdominal aorta, current management trends include the treatment of younger patients with longer life expectancies, raising the issue of postoperative surveillance. There are several relevant differences between these anatomic areas when it comes to surveillance, including the relative inaccessibility of the thoracic aorta to ultrasound interrogation and the increased variability of thoracic aortic pathologies and post-TEVAR complications. In addition, concerns regarding radiation-induced carcinogenesis and contrast-induced nephropathy reduce the enthusiasm of many surgeons for regular computed tomography surveillance. Most agree that surveillance is important after TEVAR, but the method, duration, and frequency of that surveillance is much less clear and is the topic of this debate.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the effect of an open vascular simulation course on the surgical skill of junior surgical residents in performing a vascular end-to-side anastomosis and determined the course length required for effectiveness. We hypothesized that a 6-week course would significantly increase the surgical skill of junior residents in performing an end-to-side anastomosis, while a 3-week course would not.\nWe randomized 37 junior residents (postgraduate year 1 to 3) to a course consisting of three (short course, n = 18) or six (long course, n = 19) consecutive weekly 1-hour teaching sessions. Content focused on instrument recognition and performance of an end-to-side vascular anastomosis using a simulation model. A standardized 50-point vascular skills assessment (SVSA) measured knowledge and technical proficiency. Senior residents (postgraduate year 4 to 5) were tested at baseline. Junior residents were tested at baseline and at 1 and 16 weeks after course completion, and their scores were compared with baseline and senior resident scores. Residents and faculty completed a standardized anonymous evaluation of the course.\nBaseline scores between short-course and long-course participants were not different. At baseline, junior residents had significantly lower SVSA scores than senior residents (36\u00b17 vs 41.4\u00b12.5; P=.002). One week after course completion, SVSA scores for short-course (43.5\u00b12.9 vs 34.2\u00b17.5; P=.008) and long-course (43.9\u00b15.6 vs 38.3\u00b15.9; P=.006) participants were significantly improved from baseline. SVSA scores decreased slightly at 16 weeks but remained above baseline in short-course (39\u00b16.2 vs 34.2\u00b17.5; P=.03) and long-course (40\u00b14.5 vs 38.3\u00b15.9; P=.08) participants. Long vs short course length did not affect improvement in SVSA scores at 1 or 16 weeks. In short-course and long-course participants, SVSA scores at 1 and 16 weeks were not significantly different from senior resident scores. Course ratings were high, and 95% of residents indicated the course \"made them a better surgeon.\" Residents and faculty felt the educational benefit of the course merited the investment of resources.\nAn open vascular simulation course consisting of three weekly 1-hour sessions increased the surgical skill of junior residents in performing a vascular end-to-side anastomosis to that of senior residents on a standardized assessment. A 6-week course provided no additional benefit. This study supports the use of an open vascular simulation course to teach vascular surgical skills to junior residents. A course consisting of three 1-hour sessions is an effective and efficient component of a simulation program for junior surgical residents in a busy surgical center.",

    "abstract": "Robust guidelines exist for the treatment of carotid stenosis and intracranial aneurysms independently, however, the management of tandem carotid stenosis and intracranial aneurysms remains uncertain. Although the prevalence of tandem pathologies is small (1.9%-3.2%), treating carotid stenosis can alter intracranial hemodynamics potentially predisposing to aneurysm rupture. In this review, our aim was to assess the safety of intervention in this cohort, by analyzing outcomes from the published literature.\nThe preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to conduct the review. Articles from 1947 to 2012 were searched using EMBASE Classic and EMBASE (November, 1947 -March, 2012) and Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process and other NonIndexed Citations and Ovid MEDLINE(R) on Ovid SP, http://ClinicalTrials.gov, http://controlled-trials.com and the Cochrane review database using a predefined search strategy.\nOne hundred forty-one patients from 27 articles were included. Interventions ranged from single (n=104, 74%), staged (n=26, 18%) to simultaneous procedures (n=11, 8%). The largest cohort of patients was treated by carotid endarterectomy alone (n=92, 66%). The majority of patients presented with a symptomatic carotid stenosis and an asymptomatic ipsilateral intracranial aneurysm (n=70, 50%). Five subarachnoid hemorrhages occurred (4% [5/140], three within 30 days of the procedure and two thereafter) of which two were fatal. All five occurred in patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy as a single procedure (5%). Two of the five patients presented with ruptured posterior communicating artery aneurysms.\nPublished reports of perioperative aneurysm rupture are rare in individuals with tandem carotid stenosis and intracranial aneurysms. This is the first analysis of all published cases. However, it is limited by the small number of studies and the possible underreporting due to publication bias and underdiagnosis where angiography was not performed. Although we report a low incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage, analysis of registry data with a larger cohort is warranted to confirm these findings.",

The majority of patients presented with a symptomatic carotid stenosis and an asymptomatic ipsilateral intracranial aneurysm (n=70, 50%). Five subarachnoid hemorrhages occurred (4% [5/140], three within 30 days of the procedure and two thereafter) of which two were fatal.

    "abstract": "A growing body of literature in vascular surgery demonstrates disparities in the type of health care that racial/ethnic minorities receive in the United States. Numerous recommendations, including those of the Institute of Medicine, have been set forth, which identify increasing the number of minority health professionals as a key strategy to eliminating health disparities. The purpose of this study is to compare the racial/ethnic distribution of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) membership, the SVS leadership, vascular surgery trainees, and medical students. The results demonstrate that the racial/ethnic distribution of the SVS membership reflects a considerable lack of diversity with a paucity of diversity among the SVS leadership. An increasing rate of racial/ethnic diversity among vascular surgery trainees may indicate that the SVS will see an improvement in diversity in the future.",

    "abstract": "Surgical excision is the preferred definitive treatment for carotid body tumors, although postoperative morbidity rate as quoted in the literature is rather high. Morbidity includes cranial nerve dysfunction, stroke, and the majority severe blood loss. Embolization of the feeding branches of the external carotid artery can be performed a few days prior to surgery with the intention to decrease blood loss during operation, facilitate surgical resection, and reduce operating time and morbidity. The special risk of embolization is migration into the intracranial circulation. Poloxamer 407, a reverse-thermal polymer, is a nontoxic compound that is a viscous liquid at room temperatures but instantly changes to a firm water-soluble gel when warmed to body temperature. It dissolves spontaneously or can be dissolved at will by cooling. We describe an intraoperative technique for complete devascularization of carotid body tumor by using an intraarterial temporary occlusion technique with a poloxamer 407.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the impact of diabetes in the management of patients with small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).\nThree-hundred sixty patients with small AAA (4.1-5.4 cm), enrolled in a randomized trial comparing early endovascular repair versus surveillance and delayed repair (after achievement of >5.5 cm or growth>1 cm/yr), were analyzed with standard survival methods to assess the relation between diabetes and risk of all-cause mortality, complications, and aneurysm growth (on computed tomography as per trial protocol) at 36 months. Baseline covariates were selected with partial likelihood stepwise method to investigate factors (demographic, morphologic, medications) associated with risk of aneurysm growth during surveillance.\nPrevalence of diabetes was 13.6%. The hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality at 36 months was higher in diabetic compared with nondiabetic patients: (HR, 7.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55-35.13; P=.012). Baseline aneurysm diameter was comparable between diabetic and nondiabetic patients enrolled in the surveillance arm and was related to subsequent aneurysm growth in covariance analyses adjusted for diabetes (49.3 mm for nondiabetic; 50.2 mm for diabetic). Cox analyses found diabetes as the strongest independent negative predictor of 63% lower probability of aneurysm growth>5 mm during surveillance (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15-0.92; P=.003). Kaplan-Meier cumulative probability of aneurysm growth>5 mm at 36 months was 40.8% in diabetics versus 85.1% in nondiabetics (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.17-0.61).\nProgression of small AAA seems to be more than 60% lower in patients with diabetes. This may help to identify high-risk subgroups at higher likelihood of AAA enlargement, such as nondiabetics, for surveillance protocols in patients with small AAA.",

    "abstract": "In patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), the postimplantation syndrome (PIS), comprising fever and inflammation, occurs frequently. The cause of PIS is unclear, but graft composition and acute thrombus formation may play a role. The objective of this study was to evaluate these possible causes of the inflammatory response after EVAR.\nOne hundred forty-nine patients undergoing elective EVAR were included. Implanted stent grafts differed mainly in the type of fabric used: either woven polyester (n=82) or expanded polytetrafluorethylene (ePTFE; n=67). Tympanic temperature and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed daily during hospitalization. PIS was defined as the composite of a body temperature of \u226538\u00b0C coinciding with CRP>10 mg/L. Besides graft composition, the size of the grafts and the volume of new-onset thrombus were calculated using dedicated software, and results were correlated to PIS.\nImplantation of grafts made of polyester was associated with higher postoperative temperature (P<.001), CRP levels (P<.001), and incidence of PIS (56.1% vs 17.9%; P<.001) compared to ePFTE. After multivariate analysis, woven polyester stent grafts were independently associated with an increased risk of PIS (hazard ratio, 5.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-19.4; P=.007). Demographics, amount of graft material implanted, or new-onset thrombus had no association with PIS.\nThe composition of stent grafts may play a material role in the incidence of postimplantation syndrome in patients undergoing EVAR. Implantation of stent grafts based on woven polyester was independently associated with a stronger inflammatory response.",

    "abstract": "Although aortoiliofemoral bypass grafting is the optimal revascularization method for patients with severe aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD), previous studies have documented poor patency rates in young adults. This study investigated whether young patients with AIOD have worse outcomes in patency, limb salvage, and long-term survival rates after reconstructive surgery than their older counterparts.\nPatients aged\u226450 years undergoing reconstructive surgery at our institution for AIOD between 1995 and 2010 were compared with a cohort of randomly selected patients aged\u226560 years (two for each of the young patients, matched for year of operation), analyzing demographics, risk factors, indications for surgery, operative details, and outcomes.\nAmong 927 consecutive patients undergoing primary surgery for AIOD, 78 (8.4%) aged\u226450 years (mean age, 48.4 years) and 156 older control patients (mean age, 71.2 years) were identified. The younger patients were mainly men (81%) and 59% had surgery for limb salvage and 41% for disabling claudication (P=.02). Compared with older patients, they were significantly more likely to be smokers (90% vs 72%; P=.002) and had previously needed significantly more inflow procedures (28% vs 16%; P=.03). Only one death occurred perioperatively (30-day) among the control patients, and no major amputations or graft infections occurred in either group. The need for subsequent infrainguinal reconstructions was greater in the younger patients (18% vs 7%; P=.01). The primary patency rates were inferior in the younger patients at 5 years (82% and 75%) and 10 years (95% and 90%; P=.01), whereas assisted secondary patency (89% and 82% vs 96% and 91%; P=.08), secondary patency (93% and 86% vs 98% and 92%; P=.19), limb salvage (88% and 83% vs 95% and 91%; P=.13), and survival rates (87% and 76% vs 91% and 84%; P=.32) were comparable in the two groups.\nThis study shows that despite a higher primary graft failure rate than that in older patients, aortoiliofemoral revascularization for complex AIOD is a safe procedure for younger patients with disabling claudication or limb-threatening ischemia, providing they are willing to follow a regular protocol to complete their postoperative surveillance and to undergo graft revision as necessary.",

    "abstract": "Baroreflex sensitivity is lower in patients with echogenic carotid plaques compared with patients with echolucent ones. The purpose of our study was to compare the baroreflex function after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) between patients with different plaque echogenicity.\nSpontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (sBRS), heart rate, and systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were calculated in 51 patients with a severe carotid stenosis (70%-99%) 24 hours before CEA, as well as 24 and 48 hours after CEA. Carotid plaque echogenicity was graded from 1 to 4 according to Gray-Weale classification, after duplex examination, and the patients were divided into two groups: the echolucent (grade 1 or 2) and the echogenic (grade 3 or 4).\nThe postoperative mean systolic arterial pressure values in all 51 patients at 24 and 48 hours (143.2 and 135.5 mm Hg, respectively) were found to be significantly increased compared with the preoperative value (132.5 mm Hg; x2=32, P<.001). Mean sBRS value, in all patients, was significantly reduced postoperatively to 2.1 ms mm Hg(-1), from the mean preoperative value, 3.7 ms mm Hg(-1), independently of plaque echogenicity. Twenty patients (39%) were included in the echolucent group and 31 (61%) in the echogenic. The two groups had significant differences in two parameters: the rate of diabetes mellitus and the rate of symptomatic plaques. After adjusting the two groups for these differences, we found that the preoperative difference in sBRS between the two groups (F[1,51]=11, P<.003) was eliminated 24 and 48 hours after CEA (F[1,51]=.007, P<.9 and F[1,51]=.4, P<.5 for 24 and 48 hours, respectively).\nBefore the removal of carotid atheroma, baroreflex sensitivity, which is a well established cardiovascular risk factor, seems to be affected by carotid plaque echogenicity. However, CEA has as a result a similar baroreflex response in all patients, regardless of plaque echogenicity, implying no association of plaque morphology and postoperative baroreflex sensitivity.",

However, at the present time, the data regarding the risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is still scanty and conflicted. This study aimed to explore the frequency and association of DVT with RA using a population-based dataset.\nThis was a case-control study conducted in Taiwan. A total of 5193 patients with DVT were identified from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID2000) database. In total, 20,772 controls matched with cases in terms of gender, age, and year of index date were randomly selected. We used conditional logistic regression to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for having been previously diagnosed with RA between cases and controls.\nOf the total 25,965 sampled subjects, 235 (0.9%) had been previously diagnosed with RA. Seventy-seven of these previous diagnoses were found among cases (1.5%) and 158 among controls (0.8%). Conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that cases were more likely to have had prior RA than controls (OR, 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46-2.53; P<.001). After adjusting for hospitalization history, pregnancy, fracture, surgery, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia, and renal disease, there was still a significant association between DVT and prior RA (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.42-2.58; P<.001).\nWe found RA to be significantly associated with DVT. Appropriate management should be taken to minimize the risk of DVT in patients with RA. Further study is needed to confirm our findings.",

    "abstract": "While randomized trials have shown improved operative mortality with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) but similar long-term mortality rates, enthusiasm for EVAR persists, and rates of EVAR use continue to increase. Currently, knowledge of utilization rates of EVAR in Canada is limited.\nPatients who underwent nonruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and ruptured AAA (RAAA) repair, by either open surgical repair (OSR) or EVAR, in Canada were identified from hospital discharge abstract data. Trends in rates for OSR and EVAR were calculated by province and by year, and standardized per 100,000 persons over 65 years of age (per capita).\nBetween April 2004 and March 2009, 15,960 AAA procedures were performed in Canada, either by OSR (n=12,204) or EVAR (n=3756). The proportion of all elective AAA procedures by EVAR increased from 11.5% in 2005 to 35.5% in 2009, the highest current proportion of EVAR utilization in British Columbia (45.0%) and the lowest in Manitoba (15.8%). After standardization, the national rate of total procedures was steady, but the rate of RAAAs declined over the entire study period. Alberta consistently had the highest per capita rates of EVAR use (38.9), whereas Prince Edward Island had the lowest (8.4). Provincial variations in EVAR use did not correlate with differences in comorbidities. Compared with Canadian averages, Atlantic Provinces performed the most AAA procedures per capita (137.5 vs 93.4), had the highest rate of RAAAs per capita (29.7 vs 22.2), and had the lowest proportional rates of EVAR use.\nUse of EVAR in Canada for AAAs has increased in the past 5 years, without affecting overall AAA procedure volumes. Large discrepancies in EVAR use exist across Canada. The Atlantic Provinces had the highest rates of RAAAs despite having the highest rates for total AAA procedures, suggesting a population with higher susceptibility for AAAs. This region may also have the largest potential for future increased use of EVAR.",

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was evaluated during the entire hospitalization. AKI was defined by the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of function, End-stage renal disease) consensus criteria.\nThe study included 171 patients (80% men) who were a mean age of 69\u00b114 years (range, 18-87 years). AKI occurred in 24 patients (14%). Independent predictors of postoperative AKI were preoperative depressed eGFR, thoracoabdominal extent, and postoperative transfusion. Patients with AKI experienced major postoperative complications (P=.001), longer hospitalization (P=.008), and higher hospital mortality (29% vs 4%; P<.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a survival of 82%, 51%, and 51% at 1, 3, and 5 years for patients who developed AKI, which was significantly worse than the 99%, 89%, and 80% for patients who did not experience AKI (P=.001).\nPreoperative poor renal function, blood transfusions, and the thoracoabdominal extent of the aortic disease were the most important predictors for AKI.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated outcomes of remote endarterectomy (RE) vs endovascular (ENDO) interventions on TransAtlantic Inter-Societal Consensus (TASC)-II D femoropopliteal lesions and identified factors predictive of restenosis.\nFrom October 2004 to December 2008, 95 patients with TASC-II D lesions were randomized 1:1 to receive RE of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) with end point stenting (51 patients) or ENDO, consisting of subintimal angioplasty with stenting (44 patients). The groups were balanced for age, sex, atherosclerotic risk factors, and comorbidities. Categoric data were analyzed with \u03c72 tests, and time to event provided two-sided P values with a level of significance at .05 and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Survival curves for primary patency were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis for diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and critical ischemia was performed according to the Cox proportional hazards model.\nThe mean follow-up was 52.5 months (range, 35-75 months). Five RE patients and four ENDO patients were lost to follow-up (censored). Primary patency was 76.5% (39 of 51) in RE and 56.8% (25 of 44) in ENDO (hazard ratio [HR], 2.6; 95% CI, 0.99-4.2; P=.05) at 24 months and was 62.7% (32 of 46) in RE and 47.7% (21 of 40) in ENDO (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 0.94-3.78; P=.07) at 36 months. Assisted primary patency was 70.6% (36 of 51) in RE and 52.3% (23 of 44) in ENDO (HR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.20-5.02; P=.01). Secondary patency overlapped the primary comparison data at 12 and 24 months; at 36 months, there was a slight but significative advantage for RE (HR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.05-4.86; P=.03). Univariate analysis demonstrated that hypercholesterolemia and critical limb ischemia (CLI) were significantly related to patency failure, whereas diabetes was significant only in ENDO. These factors (hypercholesterolemia and CLI) were independent predictors of patency on Cox multivariate analysis.\nRE is a safe, effective, and durable procedure for TASC-II D lesions. Our data demonstrate a significantly higher primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency of RE vs ENDO procedures. Furthermore, overall secondary patency rates remain within the standard limits, although preoperative CLI and dyslipidemia continue to be associated with worse outcomes. Taken together, these data suggest that RE should be considered better than an endovascular procedure in SFA long-segment occlusion treatment.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have investigated the development of new ischemic brain lesions on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) after carotid artery stenting (CAS). The rate of ischemic brain injury after CAS for asymptomatic stenosis has not been extensively studied but is presumed to be less likely than in symptomatic patients. This study assessed the occurrence of cerebral embolization after CAS for asymptomatic vs symptomatic carotid stenosis.\nDuring an 18-month period, 40 patients undergoing CAS under filter embolic protection were prospectively evaluated. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) during CAS and preprocedural and 24-hour postprocedural DW-MRI were used to assess cerebral embolization. Univariate and nonparametric analyses were used to compare differences in cerebral embolization after CAS in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.\nCAS was performed for 23 asymptomatic (58%) and 17 symptomatic (42%) carotid stenoses. The median microembolic counts detected by TCD were 285 (interquartile range [IQR], 182-376) for asymptomatic and 313 (IQR, 170-426) for symptomatic carotid stenosis (P=.6). DW-MRI was available for assessment in 20 asymptomatic and 14 symptomatic patients. New acute cerebral emboli detected with DW-MRI occurred in 10 asymptomatic (50%) and 7 symptomatic patients (50%) undergoing CAS (P=.9). The ipsilateral and total median number of DW-MRI lesions between groups were not statistically significantly different at, respectively, 1 (IQR, 0-2.5) and 1.5 (IQR, 0-3) for asymptomatic vs 0.5 (IQR, 0-2) and 0.5 (IQR, 0-3) for symptomatic carotid stenosis (P>.5). One asymptomatic patient sustained a minor stroke after CAS. No new neurologic events occurred in symptomatic patients. The 30-day stroke-death rate was 2.5% in this series.\nCerebral embolization, as detected by TCD and DW-MRI, occurs with a similar frequency after CAS for asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis. Because postprocedural ischemic brain injury occurs in approximately half of asymptomatic patients, the safety of CAS under filter embolic protection for asymptomatic carotid stenosis is uncertain and warrants further study.",

    "abstract": "During the past 2 decades, atherosclerosis and its clinical sequelae have increasingly been recognized as an inflammatory disease. Examination of multiple circulating inflammatory biomarkers has shown that they independently predict cardiovascular risk in patients with and without overt cardiovascular disease. Among these, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein has proved to be most robust in adding to global risk prediction models. Statins, a class of drugs that reduce levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and other inflammatory biomarkers, have been the most thoroughly studied anti-inflammatory agents to reduce cardiovascular risk. However, all such trials are necessarily confounded by the ability of statins to markedly reduce cholesterol, a well-known causal risk factor for adverse vascular outcomes. Nevertheless, the provocative results of several key statin trials have provided the scientific basis to test the hypothesis that reducing inflammation will improve cardiovascular outcomes with novel and specific anti-inflammatory agents. These newer drugs promise to reduce inflammatory marker levels without affecting lipids, glucose, or blood pressure. The results of these trials will provide key data to help us understand the relationship between inflammation and vascular risk.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous techniques for crossing femoropopliteal chronic total occlusions (CTOs) offer an alternative to bypass surgery in patients deemed to be at increased risk due to advanced age or comorbidities. Recent reports document good success rates in catheters designed to reconstitute peripherally occluded arteries following failed guidewire passage. The Wildcat catheter (Avinger, Redwood City, Calif) is a novel device with a rotating distal tip and deployable wedges fashioned for channeling a passage through arterial occlusions. This report describes the results of a prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of the Wildcat device when crossing de novo or restenotic femoropopliteal CTOs.\nBetween August 2010 and April 2011, patients with peripheral arterial disease due to a femoropopliteal CTO>1 cm and \u226435 cm were evaluated for study enrollment at 15 U.S. sites. During treatment, the physician initially attempted to cross the CTO using conventional guidewires per protocol; if the guidewire successfully crossed, the patient was considered a screen failure and the Wildcat was not deployed. At 30 days, patients were reevaluated. The primary efficacy end point was successful crossing of the Wildcat into the distal true lumen as confirmed by angiography. Primary safety end points included no in-hospital or 30-day major adverse events, no clinically significant perforation or embolization, and no grade C or greater dissection. Additional data collected included lesion length, degree of calcification, and location.\nEighty-eight patients were enrolled in the trial. Of these, the Wildcat device was used in 84 patients (95%) per protocol. Successful CTO crossing was reported and confirmed by independent review in 89% (75/84) of cases with 5% (4/84) major adverse events as defined in the protocol (predominantly perforations sealed with balloon inflation). There were no clinically relevant events associated with any of the perforations. The mean CTO length was 174\u00b196 mm (range, 15-350 mm). Approximately 57% (n=48) of all lesions were categorized as containing at least moderate calcification. Eighty-nine percent (n=75) of vessels recanalized were superficial femoral arteries.\nIn this multicenter study, the Wildcat catheter demonstrated an 89% crossing success rate with little associated morbidity. The Wildcat catheter is a viable device for crossing moderately calcified femoropopliteal CTOs.",

    "abstract": "The effect of national quality initiatives aiming at limiting lower extremity amputations in diabetic patients remains uncertain. We therefore explored trends in amputation among Medicare diabetic patients with a focus on those at highest risk.\nThe Diabetes Analytical File, an enhanced sample of all diabetic patients from the Medicare 5% sample, was used to study the national incidence of amputation in diabetic patients. Within a cohort of \u223c5 million diabetic patients between 1999 and 2006, we compared the incidence of amputation in high-risk (end-stage renal disease or more than three comorbidities) and low-risk groups and by race.\nBetween 1999 and 2006, 23,976 amputations were performed, comprising 11,558 in high-risk and 12,418 in low-risk patients. The amputation rate declined over time from 4.8/1000 in 1999 to 4.4/1000 in 2006 (P<.001). High-risk patients represented a growing proportion of all amputations (33% in 1999, 50% in 2006; P<.001) despite representing 4% of diabetic patients in 1999 and 10% in 2006 (P<.001). The incidence of amputation was 29.6/1000 in the high-risk group vs 2.7/1000 in low-risk patients (P<.001). African Americans had higher rates of amputation in high-risk and low-risk groups.\nHigh-risk patients represent a minority of Medicare diabetic patients but account for 50% of all amputations, and this effect is magnified in African Americans. Future quality improvement efforts should focus on high-risk patients and African Americans.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is almost invariably associated with a generalized atherosclerotic involvement of the arterial tree and endothelial dysfunction. Previous short-term studies showed improvement of vascular reactivity and walking capacity in PAD patients by measures aimed at restoring nitric oxide (NO) production. NO is also known to prevent the progression of atherosclerosis. We wished to assess whether the prolonged administration of an NO-donating agent (NCX 4016) improves the functional capacity of PAD patients and affects the progression of atherosclerosis as assessed by carotid intima-media thickness (IMT).\nThis prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 442 patients with stable intermittent claudication who were randomized to NCX 4016 (800 mg, twice daily) or its placebo for 6 months. The primary study outcome was the absolute claudication distance on a constant treadmill test (10% incline, 3 km/h). The main secondary end point was the change of the mean far-wall right common carotid artery IMT.\nThe increase of absolute claudication distance at 6 months compared with baseline was 126\u00b1140 meters in the placebo-treated group and 117\u00b1137 meters in the NCX 4016-treated group, with no significant differences. Carotid IMT increased in the placebo-treated group (+0.01\u00b10.01 mm; P=.55) and decreased in the NCX 4016-treated group (-0.03\u00b10.01 mm; P=.0306). Other secondary end points did not differ between the two treatments.\nLong-term NO donation does not improve the claudication distance but does reduce progression of atherosclerosis in patients with PAD. Further studies aimed at assessing whether long-term NO donation may prevent ischemic cardiovascular events are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Fenestrated-branched stent grafts have been developed as a minimally invasive, endovascular alternative for the treatment of complex aortic aneurysms in high-risk patients. However, the manufacture of these devices can take as long as 6 to 12 weeks, and therefore, they cannot be used to treat aortic emergencies. We reviewed our experience with surgeon-modified, fenestrated-branched stent grafts (sm-FBSGs) in high-risk patients who presented as emergencies with ruptured or symptomatic complex aortic aneurysms.\nAll patients treated with sm-FBSGs at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patients presenting with acute symptoms or an emergency indication for repair were analyzed.\nTwelve high-risk patients (nine men), of which seven were at American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 and five were at class 3, presented with seven symptomatic and five ruptured aortic aneurysms. Mean age was 71 years (range, 52-86 years), and mean maximal aneurysm size was 8.1 cm (range, 5-12 cm). Six patients (50%) had prior aortic surgery or a hostile abdomen. Relevant comorbidities included coronary disease in all 12 patients, and seven (58%) had an ejection fraction\u226435%. Nine patients (75%) had severe pulmonary dysfunction. Four aneurysms were pararenal, and eight were thoracoabdominal (two type II, three type III, and three type IV). An average of three visceral vessels (range, 2-4) were treated per patient, with 35 branches targeted. Endografts were successfully implanted in all patients. There was no paraplegia or intraoperative death. One patient (8.3%) died of subarachnoid hemorrhage\u226430 days. Reintervention was necessary in two patients, for a type 3 endoleak and for evacuation of a retroperitoneal hematoma. Morbidity included one myocardial infarction, and two patients each with transient respiratory failure and transient renal insufficiency not requiring dialysis. Mean postoperative length of stay was 4 days in the intensive care unit and 8 days in the hospital. At a mean follow-up of 9 months (range, 3-18 months), two patients died of non-aneurysm-related causes. Branch vessel patency was 100%. No late reinterventions were necessary. No type I or III endoleaks occurred. One type II endoleak is under observation.\nSm-FBSG may play an important role in the treatment of select patients with symptomatic or ruptured complex aortic aneurysms who are at prohibitive risk for open surgery and in whom endovascular repair cannot be delayed to allow implantation of a custom-made commercial device. Until an off-the-shelf fenestrated-branched device is created that does not require a prolonged waiting period, this may be the best option to treat patients with symptomatic or ruptured complex aneurysms that are at excessively high surgical risk.",

    "abstract": "Concurrent iliac occlusion and abdominal aortic aneurysm is rare. Traditionally, the endovascular approach to these patients has consisted of aortouniiliac devices combined with femoral-femoral bypass. With improved facility of endovascular techniques, standard bifurcated endografts represent an alternative option in these patients. This study examined outcomes of patients undergoing iliac recanalization and traditional bifurcated endovascular aneurysm repair in the face of access vessel occlusion.\nOutcomes of patients at three academic tertiary referral centers who underwent attempted iliac recanalization of chronic iliac occlusions and concurrent endovascular aneurysm repair of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with acute iliac thrombosis and those with severely stenotic (but patent) iliac vessels were excluded.\nDuring a 6-year period, 15 occluded iliac arteries were treated in 14 patients (13 men). Mean age was 67.8 years (range, 52-80 years). Primary indication for intervention was disabling claudication in four patients, size of abdominal aortic aneurysm in nine, and symptomatic aneurysm in one. Seven patients presented with a unilateral common iliac artery (CIA) occlusion, four with a unilateral external iliac artery (EIA) occlusion, three with a unilateral combined CIA and EIA occlusion, and one with bilateral CIA occlusions. Stents had been placed previously in two of the occluded CIAs and in one of the occluded EIAs. Average length of the occluded segment was 7.5 cm (range, 2-17 cm). The occluded CIAs and EIAs had mean diameters of 8.6 and 5.7 mm, respectively. Successful recanalization was achieved in 14 of the 15 vessels (93.3%). One EIA ruptured during recanalization but was easily controlled with a covered stent. A re-entry device was used in two cases. Overall, 13 bifurcated devices were successfully implanted. Bilateral iliac occlusions in one patient were recanalized. One Talent (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif), eight Excluder (W. L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz), and four Zenith (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) devices were used. Mean length of stay was 2.3 days (range, 1-6 days). No major perioperative complications or deaths occurred. During a mean follow-up of 28.2 months (range, 1-86 months), there was 100% primary patency of successfully recanalized iliac arteries. Aneurysm sac size decreased from a mean of 5.1 cm (range, 3.1-7.6 cm) preoperatively to 4.4 cm (range, 2.8-7.1 cm) at follow-up. No aneurysms grew or ruptured. Three type II endoleaks occurred, one of which required coiling at 15 months. Two late deaths occurred: one at 36 months secondary to complications from a coronary artery bypass graft/mitral valve replacement and one at 34 months from a myocardial infarction.\nThe use of bifurcated endovascular devices after recanalization of an occluded iliac system is technically feasible and durable at midterm follow-up. This technique re-establishes aortoiliac inflow to both lower extremities, obviates the need for extra-anatomic bypass, and may preserve hypogastric perfusion in some patients.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular matrix dysregulation in the aortic media has been considered as the intrinsic factor for the formation of thoracic aortic dissection. However, the mechanisms of extracellular matrix disorders in the dissected aortic media remain unclear. This study was designed to investigate the relevance between smooth muscle cell phenotypes and extracellular matrix disorders in the dissected media. Their interaction may account for the pathogenesis of thoracic aortic dissection.\nThoracic aortic samples were collected from 10 patients with thoracic aortic dissection and 10 controls. Primary cultures of aortic medial smooth muscle cells were obtained with optimized explant technique. In this study, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 2, and smoothelin were applied as the contractile phenotypic markers and osteopontin was applied as the synthetic marker. Compared with controls, immunostaining and immunoblotting demonstrated that in vivo expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 2, and smoothelin were significantly decreased in the dissected media, whereas that of osteopontin was elevated (P<.01 for all). In vitro expression of the phenotypic markers showed the similar patterns. Furthermore, smooth muscle cells derived from the dissected media exhibited enhanced proliferation (P<.01), increased collagens I and III synthesis (2.6- and 4.4-fold, respectively; P<.01 for both), and elevated matrix metalloproteinase-2 production (4.2-fold; P<.01). Consistently, the protein levels of type I and III collagens and matrix metalloproteinase-2 in the dissected media were raised by 4.6-, 4.0-, and 3.7-fold, respectively (P<.01 for all). Collagen deposition was correspondingly increased and elastic fibers were decreased and disrupted.\nSmooth muscle cells in the dissected media exhibit phenotypic switching from the contractile to the synthetic type. The synthetic smooth muscle cells increase collagen synthesis and matrix metalloproteinase-2 production, both of which can promote collagen deposition and elastin degradation in thoracic aortic dissection.",

The goal of this study was to compare the incidence of new ischemic cerebral lesions on diffusion-perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences after transcervical CAS performed with carotid flow reversal vs stenting via transfemoral approach with distal filter protection.\nDuring a 26-month period, 64 consecutive patients diagnosed with significant carotid stenosis by ultrasound imaging were assigned to transcervical CAS with carotid flow reversal or a transfemoral approach with a distal filter. The Rankin stroke scale was administered by an independent neurologist, and diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) studies were performed \u226424 hours before and \u226424 to 48 hours after the procedure. DW-MRI studies were compared by two neuroradiologists not involved in the study and blinded for time, clinical status, and treatment option. Hyperintense DW-MRI signals found after the procedure were interpreted as postoperative ischemic infarcts. All patients were assessed at 1, 6, and 12 months after the intervention.\nThe distribution of demographic and pathologic variables was similar in both groups. All procedures were technically successful, with a mean carotid flow reversal time of 22 minutes. Twenty-one (70%) and 23 patients (69.69%) were symptomatic in the transcervical and transfemoral groups, respectively (P=.869). After intervention, new postprocedural DW-MRI ischemic infarcts were found in four transcervical (12.9%) and in 11 transfemoral (33.3%) patients (P=.03), without new neurologic symptoms. No major adverse events occurred at 30 days after the intervention. All patients remained neurologically intact, without an increase in stroke scale scoring. All stents remained patent, and all patients remained stroke-free during follow-up. In multivariate analysis, age (relative risk [RR], 1.022; P<.001), symptomatic status (RR, 4.109; P<.001), and open-cell vs closed-cell stent design (RR, 2.01; P<.001) were associated with a higher risk of embolization in the transfemoral group but not in the transcervical group.\nThese data suggest that transcervical carotid stenting with carotid flow reversal carries a significantly lower incidence of new ischemic brain infarcts than that resulting from transfemoral CAS with a distal filter. The transcervical approach with carotid flow reversal may improve the safety of CAS and has the potential to improve results in especially vulnerable patients such as the elderly and symptomatic.",

    "abstract": "The natural history of patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) undergoing hemodialysis access placement is unknown. MetS has previously been found as a risk factor for poor outcomes for vascular surgery patients undergoing other interventions. The aim of this is study is to describe the outcomes of MetS patients undergoing primary hemodialysis access placement.\nThe medical records of the 187 patients who underwent hemodialysis access placement between 1999 and 2009 at the Veterans Administration Connecticut Healthcare System were reviewed. Survival, primary patency, and secondary patency were evaluated using the Gehan-Breslow test for survival. MetS was defined as the presence of three or more of the following: blood pressure\u2265130/90 mm Hg; triglycerides\u2265150 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein\u226450 mg/dL for women and \u226440 mg/dL for men; body mass index\u226530 kg/m2; or fasting blood glucose\u2265110 mg/dL.\nOf the 187 patients who underwent hemodialysis access placement, 115 (61%) were identified to have MetS. The distribution of MetS factors among all patients was hypertension in 98%, diabetes in 58%, elevated triclyceride in 39%, decreased high-density lipoprotein in 60%, elevated body mass index in 36%, and 39% were currently receiving hemodialysis. Patients were a mean age of 66 years. The median length of follow-up was 4.2 years. The forearm was site of fistula placement in 53%; no difference existed between groups (MetS, 57%; no MetS, 50%; P=.388). The median time to primary failure was 0.46 years for all patients (MetS, 0.555 years; no MetS, 0.436 years; P=.255). Secondary patency was 50% at 1.18 years for all patients (no MetS, 1.94 years; MetS, 0.72 years; P=.024). Median survival duration for all patients was 4.15 years (no MetS, 5.07 years; MetS, 3.63 years; P=.019).\nMetS is prevalent among patients undergoing hemodialysis access placement. Patients with MetS have equivalent primary patency rates; however, their survival and cumulative patency rates are significantly lower than in patients without MetS. Patients with MetS form a high-risk group that needs intensive surveillance protocols.",

    "abstract": "Distal cerebral embolization is a known complication of carotid interventions. We prospectively investigated whether subclinical microembolization seen on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) leads to cognitive deficits in patients undergoing carotid revascularization procedures.\nPatients undergoing carotid interventions and eligible for MRI scanning were recruited. Among 247 patients who received preoperative and postoperative MRI evaluations, 51 also completed neuropsychologic testing before and at 1 month after their procedure. Cognitive evaluation included the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) for memory evaluation and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for general cognitive impairment screening.\nThe 51 patients (all men), comprising 16 with carotid artery stenting (CAS) and 35 with carotid endarterectomy (CEA), were a mean age of 71 years (range, 54-89 years). Among them, 27 patients (53%) were symptomatic preoperatively, including 11 who had prior stroke and 16 who had prior preoperative transient ischemic attack symptoms. Most patients had significant medical comorbidities, including hypertension (96%), diabetes (31.3%), coronary artery disease (47%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (15.7%). Two patients (4%) had prior ipsilateral CEA and eight had contralateral carotid occlusion (15.7%). Memory decline evident on RAVLT was identified in eight CAS patients and 13 CEA patients. Eleven patients had evidence of procedure-related microemboli. Although there was no significant difference in baseline cognitive function or memory change between the CEA and CAS cohorts, the CAS cohort had a significantly higher incidence of microembolic lesions. Multivariate regression analysis showed that procedure-related microembolization was associated with memory decline (P = .016) as evident by change in RAVLT. A history of neurologic symptoms was significantly associated with poor baseline cognitive function (MMSE; P = .03) and overall cognitive deterioration (change in MMSE; P = .026), as determined by Wilcoxon rank sum test and linear regression analysis, respectively.\nAlthough CEA and CAS are effective in stroke prevention, with minimal neurologic complication, neurocognitive effects remain uncertain. Procedure-associated microembolization and pre-existing neurologic symptoms are associated with poor baseline cognitive function and memory decline after the procedures. Further comprehensive cognitive evaluation to determine the benefit of carotid interventions is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Fenestrated endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (f-EVAR) of juxtarenal aneurysms requiring cannulation of the superior mesenteric artery and renal arteries is technically challenging, has a long operating time, and requires bilateral large-caliber sheath insertion into the femoral arteries. Consequently, the risk of lower limb ischemia and subsequent reperfusion injury is increased. We describe the use of an adjunct temporary axillobifemoral bypass graft (TABFBG) for f-EVAR and propose that it be used as a strategy to avoid ischemia-reperfusion injury in patients anticipated as being at increased risk.\nConsecutive patients from a tertiary referral center undergoing f-EVAR, between October 2008 and August 2011, were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with lower limb arterial occlusive disease and those with difficult anatomy had an adjunct TABFBG.\nAll patients presenting with a juxtarenal aortic aneurysm were treated endovascularly, regardless of aneurysm anatomy and technical difficulties. There were 37 patients without TABFBG (group 1) and 27 with TABFBG (group 2). No patients required open conversion. Sex and age were not significantly different between the groups. The median ankle-brachial pressure index was significantly higher in group 1 (P=.0001). The groups had similar median blood loss, percentage of target vessel cannulation, and median stay in the intensive therapy unit. Morbidities were similar in both groups. There were no significant differences in cardiac, renal, or respiratory complications between the groups. The 30-day mortality was 10.8% (n=4) in group 1 and 0% in group 2 (P=.046).\nOur series has demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality (10.8% absolute risk reduction) and no increase in morbidity with the use of a TABFBG for fenestrated grafts. This is likely a result of the reduction in ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury in these patients. We therefore recommend the use of TABFBG in patients with proximal severe stenotic or occlusive disease and those in whom an operative time of >4 hours is predicted (typically those for whom three or more target fenestrations is planned).",

    "abstract": "Aortic aneurysm repair is a high-risk surgical procedure. Patients are often elderly, with multiple comorbidities that predispose them to perioperative morbidity. Use of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has increased due to reduced early perioperative risk. This study assessed whether preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) could be used to predict morbidity and hospital length of stay (LOS) after aortic aneurysm repair.\nA total of 185 patients underwent surgical repair (84 open repairs, 101 EVAR) and had adequate determination of a submaximal CPET parameter (anaerobic threshold).\nPatient comorbidities and cardiorespiratory fitness, derived from CPET, were similar between surgical procedures. Patients undergoing EVAR had fewer complications (10% vs 32%; P<.0001) and shorter mean (standard deviation [SD]) hospital LOS of 5.7 (9.3) days vs 14.4 (10.9) days compared with open repair (P<.0001). The hospital LOS was significantly increased in patients with one or more complications in both groups compared with those with no complications. In the open repair group, the level of fitness, as defined by anaerobic threshold, was an independent predictor of postoperative morbidity and hospital LOS. When the optimal anaerobic threshold (10 mL/min/kg) derived from receiver operator curve analysis was used as a cutoff value, unfit patients stayed significantly longer than fit patients in critical care (mean, 6.4 [SD, 6.9] days vs 2.4 [SD, 2.9] days; P=.002) and in the hospital (mean, 23.1 [SD, 14.8] days vs 11.0 [SD, 6.1] days; P<.0001). In contrast, fitness in the EVAR group was not predictive of postoperative morbidity but did have predictive value for hospital LOS.\nCardiorespiratory fitness holds significant clinical value before aortic aneurysm repair in predicting postsurgical complications and duration of critical care and hospital LOS. Preoperative measurement of fitness could then direct clinical management with regard to operative choice, postoperative resource allocation, and informed patient decision making.",

    "abstract": "The selective cholesterol transport inhibitor ezetimibe is widely used to prevent development of atherosclerosis in patients with hypercholesterolemia. However, whether this agent inhibits intimal hyperplasia in autologous vein grafts is unknown. The present study was undertaken to clarify if ezetimibe reduces cell proliferation and intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts.\nForty-four rabbits were randomly divided into two groups: one group received ezetimibe (0.6 mg/kg/d), and the control group did not. Ezetimibe administration was started 1 week before rabbits underwent interposition reversed autologous jugular vein grafts. The proliferative cells and apoptotic cells were counted in the vein grafts 14 days after implantation, and changes in acetylcholine-induced relaxation and endothelial intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) were examined at 28 days.\nEzetimibe reduced serum cholesterol and triglyceride. There were fewer proliferating cells in the ezetimibe group (5.7%\u00b10.2%, n=7) than in the control group (12.8%\u00b10.5%, n=7; P<.0001) and more apoptotic cells in the ezetimibe group (5.3%\u00b10.2%, n=7) than in the control group (2.3%\u00b10.2%, n=7; P<.0001). Intimal hyperplasia was less in the ezetimibe group (46.1\u00b16.0 \u03bcm, n=7) than in the control group (76.0\u00b12.5 \u03bcm, n=7; P<.01). Acetylcholine-produced endothelium-dependent relaxation was observed only in the ezetimibe group, which was blocked by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor N\u03c9-nitro-l-arginine. Acetylcholine increased [Ca2+]i only in the ezetimibe group.\nEzetimibe reduced cell proliferation and enhanced cell apoptosis, thus inhibiting intimal hyperplasia in rabbit autologous vein grafts. Ezetimibe restored the acetylcholine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in endothelial cells and improved endothelium-dependent NO-mediated relaxation in the vein graft. Our results suggest that ezetimibe enhances the function of endothelial NO through an increase in endothelial [Ca2+]i, thus reducing vein graft intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the vascular distribution of stroke after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and its relationship to perioperative death and neurologic outcome.\nA retrospective review was performed for patients undergoing TEVAR between 2001 and 2010. Aortic arch hybrid and abdominal debranching cases were excluded. Demographics, operative variables, and neurologic complications were examined. Stroke was defined as any new focal or global neurologic deficit lasting>24 hours with radiographic confirmation of acute intracranial pathology.\nPerioperative stroke occurred in 20 of 530 patients (3.8%) undergoing TEVAR. The cohort was 55% male and a mean age of 75.2\u00b18.9 years (range, 57-90 years). Among patients with perioperative strokes, the indication for surgery was degenerative aneurysm in 14 (mean diameter, 6.8 cm), acute type B dissection in four, penetrating atherosclerotic aneurysm in one, and aortic transection in one. Cases were performed urgently or as an emergency in 60%. The proximal landing zone was zone 2 in 11 or zone 3 in nine. All strokes were embolic. The vascular distribution of stroke involved the anterior cerebral (AC) circulation in eight (zone 2, n=5) and the posterior cerebral (PC) circulation in 12 (zone 2, n=6). Laterality of cerebral infarction included five right-sided, eight left-sided, and seven bilateral strokes. Nine strokes were diagnosed<24 hours after operation. There was no difference in baseline demographics, aortic pathology, acuity, zone coverage, preoperative left subclavian artery revascularization, number of stents, or estimated blood loss between stroke groups based on vascular distribution. Independent risk factors for any perioperative stroke were chronic renal insufficiency (odds ratios [OR], 4.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-17.7; P=.02) and history of prior stroke (OR, 4.92; 95% CI, 1.69-14.4; P=.004); the risk factor for AC stroke was prior stroke (OR, 7.67; 95% CI, 1.25-46.9; P=.03) and the risk factors for PC stroke were age (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00-1.23; P=.04), prior stroke (OR, 7.53; 95% CI, 1.78-31.8; P=.006), zone 2 coverage (OR, 6.11; 95% CI, 1.15-32.3; P=.03), and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (OR, 32.7; 95% CI, 1.33-807.2; P=.03). Overall in-hospital mortality was 20% (n=4), with those sustaining PC strokes observed to trend toward increased mortality (33% vs 0%; P=.12). Patients with AC strokes were more likely than those with PC strokes to achieve complete recovery of neurologic deficits before discharge (75% vs 17%; P=.02).\nPerioperative stroke after TEVAR is primarily an embolic event. Although infrequent, stroke was associated with significant morbidity and death, particularly among those with strokes involving the PC circulation.",

    "abstract": "A novel self-expanding, drug-eluting stent (DES) was designed to slowly release everolimus in order to prevent restenosis after percutaneous peripheral intervention. The purpose of this experimental animal study was to test the hypothesis that long-term local, stent-mediated delivery of everolimus would reduce neointimal hyperplasia in porcine iliac arteries.\nThe iliac arteries of 24 Yucatan mini-swine were percutaneously treated with overlapping 8- \u00d7 28-mm self-expanding nitinol stents loaded with everolimus (225 \u03bcg/cm2 stent surface area) formulated in a poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) copolymer intended to deliver the drug in a sustained fashion over about 6 months (DES). Bare nitinol self-expanding stents (bare metal stent [BMS]) were implanted in an identical fashion on the contralateral side to serve as controls. After 3, 6, or 12 months, the animals were sacrificed and the stented arteries perfusion-fixed for histomorphometric analysis.\nThe chronic presence of everolimus in arterial tissue reduced stent-induced inflammation after 3 months (inflammation score: BMS 2.29\u00b10.44 vs DES 0.17\u00b10.17; P=.001) and 6 months (BMS 2.06\u00b10.43 vs DES 0.50\u00b10.5; P=.007), although some late inflammation was observed after drug exhaustion (BMS 1.00\u00b10.25 vs DES 2.56\u00b10.62 after 12 months; P=not significant [NS]). Treatment with locally delivered everolimus significantly reduced neointimal hyperplasia after 3 months (neointimal thickness: BMS 0.79\u00b10.20 vs DES 0.37\u00b10.04 mm; P=.03) and 6 months (BMS 0.73\u00b10.14 vs DES 0.41\u00b10.08 mm; P=.05), although the effect had dissipated after 12 months (BMS 0.68\u00b10.11 vs DES 0.67\u00b10.11 mm; P=NS). Remarkably, stent-induced neoatherosclerosis, characterized by the histologic presence of foamy macrophages and cholesterol clefts, was significantly attenuated by treatment with everolimus (atherogenic change scores at 3 months: BMS 0.56\u00b10.15 vs DES 0.04\u00b10.04; P=.003; 6 months: BMS 0.84\u00b10.23 vs DES 0.00\u00b10.00; P=.004; and 12 months: BMS 0.09\u00b10.10 vs DES 0.19\u00b10.19; P=NS).\nIn this experimental animal model, local arterial stent-mediated delivery of everolimus inhibited the formation of neointimal hyperplasia and neoatherosclerosis during the first 6 months. The effect was transient, however, as arterial morphology and histology appeared similar to control stented arteries after 12 months.",

    "abstract": "Several clinical trials are currently evaluating stem cell therapy for patients with critical limb ischemia that have no other surgical or endovascular options for revascularization. However, these trials are conducted with different protocols, including use of different stem cell populations and different injection protocols, providing little means to compare trials and guide therapy. Accordingly, we developed a murine model of severe ischemia to allow methodic testing of relevant clinical parameters.\nHigh femoral artery ligation and total excision of the superficial femoral artery was performed on C57BL/6 mice. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated from the bone marrow of donor mice, characterized using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and injected (5\u00d710(5) to 2\u00d710(6)) into the semimembranosus (proximal) or gastrocnemius (distal) muscle. Vascular and functional outcomes were measured using invasive Doppler imaging, laser Doppler perfusion imaging, and the Tarlov and ischemia scores. Histologic analysis included quantification of muscle fiber area and number as well as capillary density.\nBlood flow and functional outcomes were improved in MNC-treated mice compared with controls over 28 days (flow: P<.0001; Tarlov: P=.0004; ischemia score: P=.0002). MNC-treated mice also showed greater gastrocnemius fiber area (P=.0053) and increased capillary density (P=.0004). Dose-response analysis showed increased angiogenesis and gastrocnemius fiber area but no changes in macroscopic vascular flow or functional scores. Overall functional outcomes in mice injected proximally to the ischemic area were similar to mice injected more distally, but muscle flow, capillary density, and gastrocnemius fiber area were increased (P<.05).\nHigh femoral ligation with complete excision of the superficial femoral artery is a reliable model of severe hind limb ischemia in C57BL/6 mice that shows a response to MNC treatment for functional and vascular outcomes. A dose response to the injection of MNCs appears to be present, at least microscopically, suggesting that an optimal cell number for stem cell therapy exists and that preclinical testing needs to be performed to optimally guide human trials. Injection of MNCs proximal to the site of ischemia may provide different outcomes compared with distal injection and warrants additional study.",

    "abstract": "Repair of patients with extent I and II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, whereas repair of more distal extent III and IV TAAAs has a lower risk of paraplegia and death. Therefore, we describe an approach using thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) as the index operation to convert extent I and II TAAAs to extent III and IV TAAAs amenable to subsequent open aortic repair to minimize patient risk.\nBetween July 2007 and March 2012, 10 staged hybrid operations were performed to treat one extent I and nine extent II TAAAs. Aortic aneurysm pathology included five chronic type B dissections, three acute type B dissections, and two penetrating aortic ulcers. Initially, the proximal descending thoracic aorta was repaired with TEVAR for coverage of the most proximal fenestration or penetrating ulcer, with seven elective and three emergent repairs. Interval open distal aortic replacement was performed in a short-term planned setting or for progressive dilation of the distal aortic segment. In the open repair, the proximal end of the graft was sewn directly to the distal end of the TEVAR and outer wall of the aorta.\nAverage patient age was 48 years, and 60% were men. Risk factors included hypertension (80%), current tobacco use (50%), and Marfan syndrome (30%). Complications after TEVAR included type IA (n=1) and type II (n=3) endoleaks, pleural effusions (n=3), and acute kidney injury (n=1). Three patients required endovascular reinterventions. In patients with dissection, persistent filling of the false lumen was common and associated with distal thoracic aortic dilation. Complications of open repair included acute kidney injury in two patients, but no cardiac, pulmonary, or neurologic morbidity. Median time between TEVAR and open repair was 14 weeks. Most importantly, no deaths or neurologic deficits occurred after either procedure during a median follow-up of 35 weeks.\nA staged hybrid approach to extensive TAAAs combining proximal TEVAR, followed by interval open distal TAAA repair, is safe and appears to be an effective alternative to traditional open repair. This approach may decrease the significant morbidity associated with single-stage open extent I and II TAAA repairs and may be applicable to multiple TAAA etiologies.",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a technically demanding procedure with a risk of periprocedural stroke. A scoring system based on anatomic criteria has been developed to facilitate patient selection for CAS. Advancements in simulation science also enable case evaluation through patient-specific virtual reality (VR) rehearsal on an endovascular simulator. This study aimed to validate the anatomic scoring system for CAS using the patient-specific VR technology.\nThree patients were selected and graded according to the CAS scoring system (maximum score, 9): one easy (score, <4.9), one intermediate (score, 5.0-5.9), and one difficult (score, >7.0). The three cases were performed on the simulator in random order by 20 novice interventionalists pretrained in CAS. Technical performances were assessed using simulator-based metrics and expert-based ratings.\nThe interventionalists took significantly longer to perform the difficult CAS case (median, 31.6 vs 19.7 vs 14.6 minutes; P<.0001) compared with the intermediate and easy cases; similarly, more fluoroscopy time (20.7 vs 12.1 vs 8.2 minutes; P<.0001), contrast volume (56.5 vs 51.5 vs 50.0 mL; P=.0060), and roadmaps (10 vs 9 vs 9; P=.0040) were used. The quality of performance declined significantly as the cases became more challenging (score, 24 vs 22 vs 19; P<.0001).\nThe anatomic scoring system for CAS can predict the difficulty of a CAS procedure as measured by patient-specific VR. This scoring system, with or without the additional use of patient-specific VR, can guide novice interventionalists in selecting appropriate patients for CAS. This may reduce the perioperative stroke risk and enhance patient safety.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed changes in the calf muscle deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) level during light-intensity exercise after ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) for superficial venous insufficiency.\nUGFS with 1% or 3% polidocanol foam (POL-F) was used to treat unilateral great saphenous vein reflux in 84 patients. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to measure calf muscle HHb levels before and 3 months after UGFS. The calf venous HHb blood-filling index was calculated on standing, the calf venous HHb ejection index was obtained after one tiptoe movement, and the venous HHb retention index was obtained after 10 tiptoe movements. The primary end point was an evident improvement in calf muscle deoxygenation after UGFS. The secondary end point was obliteration of the great saphenous vein.\nTreatment consisted of 1% POL-F in 48 limbs and 3% POL-F in the remaining 36. Ultrasound imaging at the 3-month follow-up demonstrated complete occlusion in 56.3% of the patients who received injections of 1% POL-F and in 66.7% of those who received injections of 3% POL-F. The difference in treatment outcome between the groups was not significant (P=.333). Reflux was absent in 39 limbs (81.3%) treated with 1% POL-F and in 34 limbs (94.4%) treated with 3% POL-F, and no significant difference was observed between the two groups (P=.076). Postsclerotherapy NIRS demonstrated significant reductions in the levels of the HHb filling index in both treatment groups (P=.039, P=.0001, respectively) and significant reductions in the levels of the HHb retention index (P<.0001, P=.008, respectively). However, the differences in the levels of the HHb ejection index before and after UGFS were not significant (P=.250, P=.084, respectively).\nOur present findings suggest that changes in the values of these parameters may be of potential use for assessing the effects of foam sclerotherapy in patients with superficial venous insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe the results of an alternative technique for inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) retrieval that can be used when the retrieval hook cannot be snared.\nRetrospective review of all patients undergoing attempted IVCF retrieval by a single surgeon between March 2009 and March 2011 was undertaken. After December 2009, in cases where the retrieval hook could not be snared, an 18F/85 cm sheath was inserted into the internal jugular vein and a Bentson wire (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) and snare were advanced across separate interstices of the filter. The resulting \"lasso\" was pulled up below the collar at the top of the filter, and the filter collapsed into the sheath.\nOver 28 months, 34 patients underwent attempted retrieval of G\u00fcnther Tulip filters (Cook Medical). Patients were 44\u00b115 years old; 59% were women (n=20). Filters were placed for venous thromboembolism with contraindication to anticoagulation in seven cases and prophylactically in 27 cases. Of the prophylactic cases, 18 (67%) were placed before planned bariatric surgery. Before December 2009, the success rate was 86% (6 of 7): the retrieval hook of one filter could not be snared and seemed to be embedded in the wall of the cava. After adoption of the described technique, the success rate was 96% (26 of 27): one patient refused further attempts at central venous catheterization after multiple unsuccessful attempts. Filters retrieved conventionally by snaring the hook (n=18) were implanted on average for 4.8\u00b13.7 months and 12.1\u00b110.1 months for those retrieved using the new technique (n=14; P=.02). All patients were discharged on the day of the procedure without complication. The one patient in whom the retrieval hook could not be snared before December 2009 has refused another attempt at retrieval.\nThe method of IVCF retrieval described here was successful in every instance in which it was attempted. It was associated with no morbidity despite the customary use of an 18F sheath in the internal jugular vein. The approach constitutes an appropriate \"fall-back\" technique when the retrieval hook of a removable IVCF cannot be snared.",

    "results": "Over 28 months, 34 patients underwent attempted retrieval of G\u00fcnther Tulip filters (Cook Medical). Patients were 44\u00b115 years old; 59% were women (n=20). Filters were placed for venous thromboembolism with contraindication to anticoagulation in seven cases and prophylactically in 27 cases. Of the prophylactic cases, 18 (67%) were placed before planned bariatric surgery. Before December 2009, the success rate was 86% (6 of 7): the retrieval hook of one filter could not be snared and seemed to be embedded in the wall of the cava. After adoption of the described technique, the success rate was 96% (26 of 27): one patient refused further attempts at central venous catheterization after multiple unsuccessful attempts. Filters retrieved conventionally by snaring the hook (n=18) were implanted on average for 4.8\u00b13.7 months and 12.1\u00b110.1 months for those retrieved using the new technique (n=14; P=.02).

    "abstract": "Previous studies have correlated increasing great saphenous vein (GSV) diameter with increasing CEAP clinical classification. Some insurance carriers are currently using specific GSV diameters to determine coverage for treatment of axial venous insufficiency. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of patient quality of life (QOL) measures with GSV diameters in varicose vein patients with GSV reflux.\nData were collected from the records of 91 patients prospectively enrolled in two varicose vein trials. The patients had symptomatic varicose veins with saphenofemoral junction and proximal GSV reflux. Maximum GSV diameter was measured on duplex ultrasound imaging, with the patient standing, within 5 cm of the saphenofemoral junction. Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire 2 (CIVIQ-2; Servier, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France), Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study (VEINES) Symptom (Sym) and QOL assessments, and the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) assessment were completed before treatment of GSV insufficiency. Demographic information, patient weight, height, and body mass index were collected. Correlations between pairs of data were done using Pearson product-moment and Spearman correlation coefficients.\nThe 91 study patients (19 men, 72 women) were a mean age of 45 years (range, 18-65 years). The mean GSV diameter was 6.7 mm (range, 2.2-14.1 mm). The mean VCSS score was 7.8 (range, 3-12). There was a weak correlation between increasing GSV diameter and VCSS (r=0.23; P=.03) and no correlation between GSV diameter and the CIVIQ-2 score (r=0.01), VEINES-QOL (r=-0.07), and VEINES-Sym (r=-0.1).\nGSV diameter is a poor surrogate marker for assessing the effect of varicose veins on a patient's QOL; thus, using GSV diameter as a sole criterion for determining medical necessity for the treatment of GSV reflux is inappropriate. Further correlations between QOL measures and duplex-derived objective findings are warranted.",
