    "abstract": "Patients with carotid body tumors referred to vascular surgeons usually undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as part of the workup. We present a case report of a 39-year-old woman with a presumed carotid body tumor, as was expected from clinical and MRI findings. At surgery, the ectopic thyroid tissue was suspected, and resection was performed. Histologic examination showed normal thyroid tissue with no sign of malignancy. Postoperative thyroid analysis showed a normally located, properly functioning thyroid gland. Ectopic thyroid glands are generally found in the midline, as a result of abnormal median migration. Their presence lateral to the midline with a proper functioning thyroid gland in its normal position is extremely rare. Although several submandibular thyroid glands have been reported, a close relation with the carotid arteries was described only once. When MRI scans of a presumed carotid body tumor show tumor characteristics that are not fully specific for a carotid body tumor, the possibility of ectopic thyroid tissue should be entertained, which can be the patient's only properly functioning thyroid tissue. In such cases, additional assessment, including thyroid tests, should be considered before surgery.",

The patient developed abdominal pain and a large, tense lower abdominal wall mass without peritoneal signs. Computed tomography scan demonstrated a massive RSH contiguous with a ruptured left internal iliac artery aneurysm. Hypovolemic shock prompted immediate laparotomy, aneurysmorrhaphy of the ruptured aneurysm, and evacuation of the rectus hematoma. This uncommon presentation of internal iliac aneurysm rupture should caution against a simple diagnosis of \"spontaneous\" RSH in a patient with a potentially ruptured iliac aneurysm.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cell (EC) migration is essential for healing areas of arterial injury and angioplasty sites. Iron or copper-oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL(Cu)) inhibits EC migration in vitro, but the effect of physiologically relevant monocyte/macrophage-oxidized LDL (oxLDL(cell)) is unknown. We postulated that oxLDL(cell) would inhibit EC migration and that this inhibition would be reversed by antioxidants.\nThe effect of oxLDL(Cu) and oxLDL(cell) on EC migration was studied by using a razor scrape assay, and migration was assessed after 24 hours. In addition, ECs were incubated with various antioxidants, including butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), probucol, or alpha-tocopherol, for 1 hour prior to initiation of the scrape assay and application of oxLDL.\nBoth oxLDL(Cu) and oxLDL(cell) inhibited migration. The antioxidants did not alter the antimigratory activity of oxLDL(Cu), but alpha-tocopherol preserved EC migration in the presence of oxLDL(cell). The lack of effect of BHT or probucol suggested that the effect of alpha-tocopherol resided not in its antioxidant activity but in its membrane-stabilizing properties. To test this theory, the effect of oxLDL and alpha-tocopherol on relative cell membrane fluidity was assessed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Both oxLDL(Cu) and oxLDL(cell) increased relative membrane fluidity. Preincubation with alpha-tocopherol inhibited the increase in membrane fluidity of ECs incubated in oxLDL(cell) but not in oxLDL(Cu).\nThese studies show that alpha-tocopherol preserves EC migration in oxLDL(cell) and hastens restoration of the endothelial monolayer after injury by inhibiting changes in membrane integrity caused by oxLDL.\nRecent studies find that vitamin E is not efficacious in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events, perhaps because vitamin E does not efficiently block oxidation pathways known to be operative in atherosclerotic arteries. \"Non-antioxidant\" properties of vitamin E, however, could be important in the primary prevention of atherosclerosis and its complications. Our in vitro studies show that alpha-tocopherol can preserve endothelial migration in the presence of cell-oxidized LDL. This effect might improve the healing of endothelial injuries at sites of arterial repair or angioplasties, especially in lipid-laden arterial walls.",

    "abstract": "Constrictive remodeling and new artery wall mass contribute to lumen narrowing in atherosclerosis and following injury. Rho-kinase, an important regulator of myosin phosphorylation and cytoskeletal reorganization, is critical to smooth muscle cell (SMC) growth and vasoconstriction, but its role in artery wall remodeling is poorly defined. We hypothesized that constrictive artery wall remodeling is dependent on Rho signaling so that blocking Rho-kinase would promote outward artery wall remodeling in response to intimal hyperplasia and thus limit lumen narrowing.\nTo test this hypothesis, we first studied the effects of the Rho-kinase inhibitor fasudil on SMC remodeling of collagen matrix in vitro. Mouse aortic SMCs were seeded into three-dimensional collagen gels with and without fasudil, and extent of contraction was measured at 24 hours. We then used the mouse carotid ligation model to study the effects of Rho-kinase inhibition on remodeling and intimal hyperplasia in vivo. C57B6/J mice were randomly assigned to fasudil (100 mg/kg per day) or vehicle and underwent unilateral carotid artery ligation or sham ligation. Remodeling and wall mass were measured after 28 days.\nFasudil blocked SMC contraction of collagen gels in a dose-dependent manner. Complete inhibition of collagen gel remodeling was achieved between 10 and 30 micromol/L fasudil. In control mice, carotid ligation caused significant thickening of the adventitia, media, and intima (P <.01) and outward remodeling of the carotid wall. The external elastic lamina (EEL) area increased by 14% versus sham (P <.05), but this increase was insufficient to prevent lumen narrowing (-42% vs sham, P <.05). Fasudil treatment had favorable effects on wall mass, inhibiting neointimal (P =.04), medial (P =.03), and adventitial thickening (P =.07) versus controls. Opposite our hypothesis, however, fasudil did not enhance outward artery wall remodeling or improve lumen caliber. Rather, inhibiting Rho-kinase blocked outward remodeling in response to ligation. EEL area was significantly smaller in treated versus control animals (P =.04) and slightly smaller versus shams (P = NS). These data suggest that Rho activation contributes significantly to both hyperplasia and outward remodeling of the injured artery wall. Rho-kinase may prove an important target to limit intimal hyperplasia and prevent restenosis when remodeling is improved by other means (eg, stents).",

    "abstract": "Single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (sc-uPA) is one of the key serine proteases involved in modulating cellular and extracellular matrix responses during tissue remodeling. Sc-uPA is composed of three domains: aminoterminal fragment (ATF), kringle domain, and carboxyterminal fragment (CTF). sc-uPA is readily cleaved into these three domain fragments in vitro, each of which is biologically active; however, their roles in the microenvironment of the vessel wall are poorly understood.\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the role of each domain of sc-uPA on vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration.\nSMCs were cultured in vitro. Assays of DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and migration were performed in response to sc-uPA, ATF, kringle, and CTF in the presence and absence of the plasmin inhibitors epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) and aprotinin, the Galphai inhibitor pertussis toxin, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (the upstream regulator of the extracellular-signal regulated kinase [ERK]) inhibitor PD98059.\nsc-uPA produced dose-dependent increases in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. These responses were dependent on the CTF domain and were sensitive to plasmin inhibitors, pertussis toxin, and PD98059. Sc-uPA also induced SMC migration, which could be elicited by both ATF and kringle. Migration to sc-uPA, ATF, and kringle was both pertussis toxin and PD98059 sensitive, but importantly was plasmin-independent.\nsc-uPA induces SMC proliferation and migration, which are domain-dependent and mediated in part by Galphai-linked, ERK-dependent processes, while only the mitogenic response is protease dependent. These findings suggest that migration is linked to a G-protein coupled nonprotease receptor, while proliferation is associated with a G-protein coupled protease receptor.",

    "abstract": "Myogenic transcranial motor-evoked potentials (tc-MEPs) were applied to monitor spinal cord ischemia in the repairs of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. We investigated whether tc-MEPs after spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion could be used to predict neurologic outcome in leporine model.\nTc-MEPs were measured at 30-second intervals before, during, and after spinal cord ischemia (SCI) induced by balloon occlusion of the infrarenal aorta. Twenty rabbits were divided into five groups. Four groups (n = 4 animals in each group) had transient ischemia induced for 10, 15, 20, or 30 minutes. In fifth group, the terminal aorta at the aortic bifurcation was occluded for 30 minutes. All animals were evaluated neurologically 48 hours later, and their spinal cords were removed for histologic examination.\nThe tc-MEPs in each SCI group rapidly disappeared after SCI. After reperfusion, the recovery of tc-MEPs amplitude was inversely correlated to duration of SCI. Tc-MEPs amplitude at one hour after reperfusion was correlated with both neurologic score and number of neuron cells in the spinal cord 48 hours later. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the neurologic deficits differed significantly between animals with tc-MEPs amplitude of less than 75% of the baseline and those with an amplitude of more than 75%.\nThe amplitude of tc-MEPs after ischemia /reperfusion of the spinal cord showed a high correlation with durations of SCI, with neurologic deficits, and with pathologic findings of the spinal cord. Tc-MEPs, therefore, could be used to predict neurologic outcome. In particular, tc-MEPs whose amplitude recovered by less than 75% indicated a risk of paraplegia.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture is associated with a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, characterized by increased microvascular permeability and neutrophil sequestration, leading to multiorgan dysfunction. We examined the role of a novel complement factor 5a (C5aR) receptor antagonist, the cyclic peptide AcF-(OpdChaWR), in attenuation of pathologic complement activation and tissue injury in a model of AAA rupture.\nAnesthetized rats were randomized to sham (control) or shock and clamp (s+c) groups. Animals in the s+c group underwent 1 hour of hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial blood pressure < or =50 mm Hg), followed by 45 minutes of supramesenteric aortic clamping, then 2 hours of resuscitated reperfusion. Animals in the s+c group were randomized to receive an intravenous bolus of C5aR antagonist at 1 mg/kg or saline solution control at the end of hemorrhagic shock. Intestinal and pulmonary permeability to iodine 125-labeled albumin was measured as an indicator of microvascular permeability. Tissue myeloperoxidase activity, proinflammatory cytokine tissue necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) protein and mRNA, and C5aR mRNA levels were measured as indicators of neutrophil sequestration and inflammatory signaling, respectively.\nLung permeability index was significantly increased in the s+c group compared with the sham group (4.43 +/- 0.96 vs 1.30 +/- 0.17; P <.01), and prevented with treatment with C5aR antagonist (1.74 +/- 0.50; P <.03). Lung myeloperoxidase activity was significantly increased in the the s+c group compared with the sham group (2.41 +/- 0.34 U/mg vs 1.03 +/- 0.29 U/mg; P <.009), and significantly attenuated with treatment with C5aR antagonist (1.11 +/- 0.09 U/mg; P <.006). Lung TNF-alpha protein levels were significantly elevated in both s+c groups, whereas lung TNF-alpha mRNA expression was significantly downregulated in both s+c groups compared with the sham group. Intestinal permeability index was significantly increased in animals in the s+c groups during reperfusion, compared with sham (P <.001), which was attenuated in early reperfusion with treatment with C5a receptor antagonist. Data represent mean +/- SEM, group comparisons with analysis of variance and post hoc Scheff\u00e9 test.\nThese results indicate that a potent antagonist of C5a receptor protects the rat intestine and lung from neutrophil-associated injury in a model of AAA rupture. These data suggest that complement-mediated inflammation can be modulated at the C5a receptor level, independent of proinflammatory TNF-alpha production, and prevent acute local and remote organ injury.",

ISR was measured with a caliper, and expressed as percentage diameter reduction of patent lumen on the venograms. Left-right limb ratio was 2.3:1; thrombotic-nonthrombotic disease ratio, 1.2:1; negative-positive thrombophilia test ratio, 1.6:1; and above-below inguinal ligament stent placement ratio, 4.5:1. Median stent length was 9 cm (range, 4-35 cm), and median lumen area before and after stenting was 0.41 cm(2) (range, 0-1.65 cm(2)) and 1.70 cm(2) (range, 0.65-4.00 cm(2)), respectively. Limbs were divided into groups with no ISR, any degree of ISR, greater than 20% diameter reduction, and greater than 50% diameter reduction. Cumulative ISR and patency rates were analyzed. Possible contributing factors were examined.\nAt 42 months, only 23% of limbs demonstrated no ISR. Cumulative rate of limbs with greater than 20% diameter reduction was 61%, and of limbs with greater than 50% diameter reduction was 15%. Patient gender or sidedness of the treated extremity did not affect outcome. At 36 months, limbs with thrombotic disease had higher ISR rates than did limbs without thrombotic disease (63% and 41% of limbs with >20% narrowing, and 23% and 4% of limbs with >50% narrowing, respectively; P <.01). Similarly, higher rates of ISR were found in patients with thrombophilia and long stents extending below the inguinal ligament. Primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates for the entire population at 3 years were 75%, 92%, and 93%, respectively. There was a significant increase in ISR in individual limbs, but analysis of groups of stents did not unequivocally show progression.\nSevere (>50%) ISR of iliofemoral venous stents is uncommon over the short term. The three major risk factors appear to be presence of thrombotic disease, positive thrombophilia test results, and stent extending below the inguinal ligament (long stents). Although stented limbs that eventually became occluded during the study demonstrated similar risk factors, no conclusion regarding a cause-effect relationship can be drawn from the present data.

Data were obtained by means of direct interview, written reports, or telephone. Data for deceased subjects were gathered from their families via written report or telephone. Graft patency was evaluated by means of ankle pressure measurement; and in all patients with decreased ankle pressure arteriography was performed.\nSeven of 110 study patients (6%) died during follow-up. Cumulative survival rate was 84% up to 25 years after the initial consultation. Results of bypass operations (n = 46) were not satisfactory. Primary graft patency was 41% at 1 year after operation, 32% at 5 years, and 30% at 10 years. Secondary graft patency was 54% at 1 year of follow-up, 47% at 5 years, and 39% at 10 years. However, major amputation was necessary in only 5 of 35 limbs (14%) with failed grafts. Forty-seven patients (43%) underwent 108 amputation procedures, either major amputation (13 patients) or minor amputation (34 patients), of an upper or lower limb. No ischemic ulcers occurred or recurred in patients older than 60 years. Forty-one patients who stopped smoking did not undergo major amputation. Furthermore, of 69 patients who continued smoking, 13 patients (19%) underwent major amputation. There was a correlation between incidence of continued smoking and limb amputation (P =.0070). In addition, 11 of 13 patients who underwent major lower limb amputation (85%) lost their job, compared with 9 of 97 patients without major amputation (9%). There was an association between limb amputation and job loss (P <.0001). All patients who lost their jobs were engaged in manual labor.\nThe natural course of life and limb is favorable in many patients with Buerger disease. Occurrence or recurrence of necrotic lesions usually is arrested in patients older than 60 years. To avoid factors that markedly influence quality of life, early treatment and strict instruction to prohibit smoking are mandatory. Arterial reconstruction shortens the healing process of ischemic ulcers, despite poor long-term results. However, bypass surgery to treat intermittent claudication should be limited.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this prospective study conducted at a tertiary referral center was to evaluate the efficacy of high-frequency duplex scanning in the preoperative evaluation of potential pedal target vessels. Material and methods The study population consisted of thirty-three consecutive diabetics suffering critical limb ischemia, with indications of infra-popliteal occlusive disease. Duplex ultrasound was performed by an angiologist unaware of any prior imaging procedures. The pedal vessels were divided into four segments. The inner diameter-, the grade of calcification (on a scale from 1-to-3), the maximal systolic velocity, and the resistance index ([V.max syst-V min syst]/V max syst), were assessed by using a 13-MHz probe, and the pedal target vessel best suited for surgery was identified. Results of duplex scanning were compared to (1) the results of selective digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) studies interpreted by two radiologists, (2) the site of distal anastomosis predicted by a vascular surgeon according to DSA and CE-MRA studies, (3) the definitive site of distal anastomosis, and (4) early postoperative results (patency at three months).\nDuplex scanning depicted significantly more pedal vascular segments than selective DSA- (P =.004, McNemar test). Agreement in predicting the site of distal anastomosis expressed as kappa value as follows: duplex versus DSA/CE-MRA, kappa 0.71;-DSA/CE-MRA versus definitive anastomosis, kappa 0.67; -and duplex versus definitive anastomosis kappa 0.82. Two patients were excluded from surgery as all three imaging modalities failed to demonstrate a pedal target vessel. Two patients had exploratory dissection of a pedal vessel (according to CE-MRA findings) that turned out to be occluded (as predicted by duplex scanning). In one patient the operation had to be terminated due to lack of autologous bypass material. In 31 patients who underwent pedal artery bypass, the resistance index could not be correlated to the run-off as assessed by intra-operative angiography.\nHigh-frequency duplex focusing on the vacular-morphology is a worthwhile diagnostic tool to evaluate-potential pedal target vessels and extremely helpful when contrast-related methods (selective DSA, CE-MRA) do not sufficiently depict the pedal vasculature.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify clinical and nonclinical factors associated with failure to perform carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with clinically appropriate indications. We analyzed data from a prospective cohort study performed at five Veterans Affairs medical centers. Patients were referred for carotid artery evaluation if they had at least 50% stenosis in one carotid artery, had no history of CEA, and were independently classified preoperatively as appropriate candidates for CEA, according to clinical criteria. The primary outcome was receipt of CEA within 6 months of evaluation. Data were collected by medical record review and interview regarding clinical status, and patient and physician perception of the risks and benefits of CEA.\nAmong clinically appropriate candidates for CEA, 66.8% (n = 233) did not undergo the operation. Compared with patients who did undergo CEA, a greater proportion of these patients had no symptoms (68.7% vs 45.7%; P <.001). A twofold greater proportion of patients who did not undergo CEA were in the highest quartile of reported aversion to surgery. Moreover, a fourfold greater proportion were perceived by their physicians to be at less than 5% risk for future stroke without the operation, and more than a twofold greater proportion were believed to experience less than 5% efficacy from the operation by their providers (P <.01). In multivariable analyses, four characteristics were significantly associated with whether an appropriate candidate did not receive CEA: asymptomatic disease, less than 70% stenosis, high expressed aversion to surgery score, and low (<5%) provider-perceived efficacy of the operation.\nAmong patients in the Veterans Affairs health care system who are clinically appropriate candidates for CEA, those who did not receive the operation were less likely to have symptomatic disease or high-grade carotid artery stenosis, but were more likely to report high aversion to surgery and to have a provider who believed CEA would not be efficacious.",

    "abstract": "With the recent emergence of carotid stenting in the management of carotid disease, the role of surgery has been challenged, particularly for recurrent carotid stenosis. This study was undertaken to determine the safety and durability of redo carotid operation (RCO) for recurrent stenosis.\nA retrospective review identified 64 consecutive patients who underwent 66 RCOs between 1990 and 2000. There were 33 males (52%) and 31 females, with a mean age of 68.2 years (range, 38-84 years). The mean interval from the primary carotid surgery to RCO was 77.5 months (range, 1-292 months). Operative indications were severe asymptomatic stenosis in 33 cases (50%), transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or amaurosis fugax in 25 (38%), recent stroke in 6 (9%), and nonhemispheric symptoms in 1. Two operations were tertiary carotid reconstructions. A total of 56 (85%) patch angioplasties were performed, 49 with vein and 6 with synthetic material. Primary closure was performed in three cases (5%), whereas interposition grafts were required in eight (12%). Complete follow-up was available in 59 patients (92%) and averaged 4.3 years (range, 0.2-12.9 years); 97% of patients underwent follow-up duplex scanning.\nThere were no operative deaths and only two operative strokes (3.1%). Permanent cranial nerve deficit occurred in one patient (1.5%). Late stroke occurred in five patients: four ipsilateral and one contralateral. Kaplan-Meier estimates for 5- and 10-year stroke-free survival were 92% and 74%, and for overall survival were 72% and 50%. Duplex scanning detected significant recurrent carotid stenosis (>80%) or occlusion in six cases (9%) at a mean follow-up of 4.1 years. Kaplan-Meier estimates for freedom from recurrent stenosis of >80% were 94% and 86% at 5 and 10 years.\nRCO for recurrent carotid stenosis can be performed safely with excellent protection from stroke and long-term durability. These data provide a standard against which the results of carotid stenting can be compared.",

This delay can result in an interval stroke rate of 9% to 15%. We analyzed our results with CEA performed within 1 to 4 weeks of stroke.\nRecords for all patients undergoing CEA after stroke between 1980 and 2001 were analyzed. Perioperative evaluation included carotid duplex scanning or angiography, and head computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. All patients with nonworsening neurologic status, additional brain territory at risk for recurrent stroke, and severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis underwent CEA. Patients were grouped according to time of CEA after stroke: group 1, first week; group 2, second week; group 3, third week; group 4, fourth week. Statistical analysis was performed with the chi(2) test, logistic regression, and analysis of variance.\nTwo hundred twenty-eight patients underwent CEA within 1 to 4 weeks of stroke. Perioperative permanent neurologic deficits occurred in 2.8% of patients in group 1 (72 procedures), 3.4% of patients in group 2 (59 procedures), 3.4% of patients in group 3 (29 procedures), and 2.6% of patients in group 4 (78 procedures). There was no relationship between location or size of preoperative infarct and time of surgery. Only preoperative infarct size correlated with probability of neurologic deficit after CEA (P <.05).\nIncidence of postoperative stroke exacerbation is similar at all intervals. The results are within acceptable limits for treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis. CEA may be performed within 1 month of stroke with similar results at all intervals during this period.",

    "abstract": "Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is associated with high cardiovascular mortality and significant clinical complications, including resistant hypertension and ischemic nephropathy. Despite availability of endovascular revascularization techniques, determining which patients should undergo revascularization and the timing of the procedure still are controversial. Several studies have reported a higher frequency of the DD genotype of the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene in patients with RAS, and one study found higher mortality in patients with the DD genotype. Material and methods We retrospectively studied 100 patients with documented atherosclerotic RAS and evaluated long-term (median follow-up, 28 months) mortality, blood pressure control, and renal function in relation to the ACE genotype and two therapeutic strategies, that is, endovascular treatment with percutaneous renal transluminal angioplasty or stenting (ET group) versus conservative drug therapy (CT group).\nComparison between therapeutic groups showed a higher cumulative probability of survival (86.7% vs 67.1%), better blood pressure control (57.4% vs 29%), and slower decline in renal function (17.9% vs 48.4%) in the ET group. The DD genotype was strongly represented in our study patients (DD, 50%; II, 15.5%; I/D, 34.5%), but bore no relation to mortality, blood pressure control, decline in renal function, or rate of recurrent stenosis.\nConservative medical treatment of RAS, compared with endovascular treatment, is associated with higher mortality, poorer blood pressure control, and impaired renal function over the long term. Early endovascular treatment enables amelioration of this unfavorable evolution. The DD genotype does not predict clinical outcome of RAS.",

    "abstract": "We report four consecutive cases of Kommerell's aneurysm of an aberrant left subclavian artery in patients with a right-sided aortic arch and the results of a systematic review of the literature. In our cohort of patients, three had an aneurysm limited to the origin of the aberrant subclavian artery, causing dysphagia and cough, and one had an aneurysm involving also the distal arch and the entire descending thoracic aorta, causing compression of the right main-stem bronchus. A left subclavian-to-carotid transposition was performed in association with the intrathoracic procedure, and a right thoracotomy was used in all patients. One of the patients underwent surgery with deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest, and the others with the adjunct of a left-heart bypass. The repair was accomplished with an interposition graft in two patients and with endoaneurysmorrhaphy in the others. The postoperative course was complicated by respiratory failure and prolonged ventilation in one patient, and one patient died because of severe pulmonary emboli. The survivors are alive and well at a follow-up of 1 to 3 years. Only 32 cases of right-sided aortic arch with an aneurysm of the aberrant subclavian artery have been reported: 12 were associated with aortic dissection, and 2 presented with rupture. Surgical repair was accomplished in 29 patients. A number of operative strategies were described: right thoracotomy, bilateral thoracotomy, left thoracotomy with sternotomy, sternotomy with right thoracotomy, and left thoracotomy. In only 12 cases was the subclavian artery reconstructed. We believe that a right thoracotomy provides good exposure and avoids the morbidity associated with bilateral thoracotomy or sternotomy and thoracotomy. We feel that a left subclavian-to-carotid transposition completed before the thoracic approach revascularizes the subclavian distribution without increasing the complexity of the intrathoracic procedure.",

    "abstract": "New devices for endovascular treatment of thoracic aortic diseases were recently approved for clinical use by European authorities, obtaining the Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (CE) mark. In all patients who underwent endovascular treatment of a thoracic aortic disease in 2002, we used a new CE-marked device, the Endofit stent graft. The device is constituted of nitinol stents and polytetrafluoroethylene fabric, and has a simple design and delivery system.\nDuring 2002, 11 patients (mean age, 75 years; range, 66-85 years) underwent treatment of atherosclerotic aneurysm (n = 9), chronic type B dissection (n = 1), and intramural hematoma (n = 1). Disease involved the descending thoracic aorta in 7 patients and the distal aortic arch in 4 patients.\nIn all cases the Endofit stent grafts were successfully deployed in the intended position. No postoperative paraplegia or paraparesis was recorded. There were two in-hospital deaths: 1 patient died in the operating room (postmortem examination showed a kinked graft); and the other patient died in the intensive care unit on postoperative day 30, after an intraoperative stroke. One surgical conversion was performed 2 weeks after the procedure, because of total collapse of the graft due to rupture of three stents. Other graft-related complications included type I endoleak (n = 2), type II endoleak (n = 1), and incomplete opening of the device (n = 1).\nEndovascular treatment of thoracic disease with the Endofit graft in this small heterogeneous group of patients resulted in several complications, which may arise from both the delivery system and the graft itself. At present, other commercially available endografts may be safer for endovascular treatment of thoracic aortic diseases.",

    "abstract": "It is widely believed that chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) greatly increases the risk associated with endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) and is a relative contraindication to the procedure and to the use of intra-arterial contrast agents (IACA). We reviewed a 5-year EVAR experience to determine whether the procedure and use of IACA have an important deleterious effect on renal function in patients with and without pre-existing CRI.\nEndovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was performed in 200 patients with a variety of endografts, with intra-arterial contrast agents. The patients were retrospectively assigned to three groups on the basis of preoperative serum creatinine concentration (Cr): group 1 (n = 108), Cr less than 1.5 mg/dL (normal range); group 2 (n = 65), Cr 1.5 to 2.0 mg/dL; group 3 (n = 27), Cr 2.1 to 3.5 mg/dL. No patients had undergone hemodialysis. In groups 2 and 3, patients received hydration perioperatively, and received mannitol intraoperatively; no nephrotoxic drugs were administered during the procedure, other than nonionic contrast agent (Omnipaque 350).\nThe incidence of postoperative complications between the three study groups was not statistically different. In group 1 a transient increase in serum Cr (>30% over baseline and >1.4 mg/dL) was noted in three patients (2.7%), two of whom (1.9%) required temporary hemodialysis and one (0.9%) who died of renal failure. In group 2 a transient increase in serum Cr was noted in two patients (3.1%); both patients (3.1%) required temporary hemodialysis, and one patient (1.5%) died of renal failure. In group 3 a transient increase in serum Cr was noted in two patients (7.4%); one patient (3.7%) required temporary hemodialysis, and one patient (3.7%) died of renal failure. Perioperative hypotension significantly increased the risk for elevated serum Cr and death (P <.05), and larger contrast volume was associated with an increase in serum Cr (P <.05) during the postoperative period.\nEVAR with intra-arterial contrast agents can be accomplished in patients with chronic renal insufficiency who do not require dialysis, with limited and acceptable morbidity and mortality, similar to that observed with open aneurysm repair. Contrary to other reports in which perioperative precautions were not used, our study shows that with EVAR the risk for worsening renal failure, dialysis, and death is only slightly, and not significantly, greater in patients with preoperative chronic renal insufficiency compared with patients with normal renal function. Perioperative hypotension and increased contrast volume are significant risk factors for postoperative increase in serum Cr and death. With appropriate precautions such as averting perioperative hypotension and limiting the volume of nonionic contrast agents, elevated Cr need not be a contraindication to EVAR with intra-arterial contrast agents.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and significance of aneurysm enlargement, with or without treatment, in relation to the primary end points of rupture, surgical conversion, aneurysm-related death, and survival following endovascular repair.\nAneurysm (AAA) size changes and clinical outcome of all patients treated from 1997 through 1998 during the Phase II AneuRx multicenter clinical trial of endovascular AAA repair were reviewed. Aneurysm dimensions and the presence or absence of endoleak were determined by an independent core laboratory, with enlargement or shrinkage defined as a diameter change of 5 mm or more compared with baseline.\nAmong 383 patients (89% men, 11% women, age 73 +/- 9 years), with a mean device implant time of 36 +/- 11 months (median = 39 months), aneurysm diameter decreased from 5.7 +/- 1.0 at baseline to 5.2 +/- 1.0 at 3 years (P =.0001). A total of 46 patients (12%) experienced AAA enlargement, 199 patients (52%) had no change in AAA diameter, and 138 patients (36%) had a decrease in AAA diameter of 5 mm or more. Significant risk factors for enlargement included age (enlargement patients were 4 years older on average than patients with aneurysms that decreased in size; P =.002) and the presence of an endoleak (P <.001). Among patients with endoleak at any time, 17% had aneurysm enlargement, whereas only 2% of patients without endoleak had aneurysm enlargement (P <.001). Patients with enlargement were more likely to undergo secondary endovascular procedures and surgical conversions (P <.001). Twenty patients (43%) with enlargement underwent treatment, and 26 patients were untreated. There were two deaths following elective surgical conversion and one death in a patient with untreated enlargement and a type I endoleak. Three aneurysms ruptured: one with enlargement, one with no change, and one with a decrease in aneurysm size; all three aneurysms were larger than 6.5 cm. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that freedom from rupture at 3 years was 98% with enlargement, 99% with no change, and 99% with decrease in AAA size (log-rank test, not significant). Freedom from AAA death at 3 years was 93% in patients with enlargement, 99% in no increase, and 99% in decrease (P =.005). Survival at 3 years was 86% with increase, 82% with no change, and 93% with decrease (P =.02).\nAneurysm enlargement following endovascular repair was not associated with an increased risk of aneurysm rupture or decrease in patient survival during a 3-year observation period. Aneurysm size rather than enlargement may be a more meaningful predictor of rupture. Close follow-up and a high re-intervention rate (43%) may account for the low risk of rupture in patients with enlargement. The long-term significance of aneurysm enlargement following endovascular repair remains to be determined.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the importance of experience and the learning curve with endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.\nA retrospective analysis was performed of all elective endovascular AAA repairs attempted by an individual surgeon and radiologist over a 4-year period. The primary outcome variable was achievement and 30-day maintenance of initial clinical success as defined by the Society for Vascular Surgery/American Association of Vascular Surgery reporting standards. Following standard statistical analysis, the cumulative sum (CUSUM) method was used to analyze the learning curve, with a predetermined acceptable failure rate of 10% and calculated 80% alert and 95% alarm lines.\nNinety-six elective endovascular AAA repairs were attempted by this team between 1998 and 2002 (mean age 74 +/- 0.8 years; mean aneurysm diameter 5.98 +/- 0.8 cm). Initial clinical success was achieved and maintained in 85 of 96 patients (88.5%). Although results were acceptable throughout the study period, improved results with respect to the target failure rate (10%) were not achieved until 60 patients were treated. The learning or CUSUM curves did not differ for different device manufacturers, with improved results being achieved following 20 implantations of each device. The results did differ when comparing aortouniiliac grafts (n = 27) and bifurcated grafts (n = 64). Results with bifurcated grafts remained consistent throughout the study period, whereas with aortouniiliac grafts, results improved after only a few procedures in comparison with the target failure rate.\nSuccess rates with endovascular aneurysm repair will improve with an individual's experience. The CUSUM method is a valuable tool in the evaluation of this learning curve, which has credentialing and training implications. Although acceptable results were obtained throughout the study period, this analysis indicates that 60 endovascular aneurysm repairs, or 20 with an individual device, are necessary before optimal rates of initial clinical success can be achieved. These results can be achieved more readily with aortouniiliac grafts than with bifurcated grafts.",

    "abstract": "The behavior of the aneurysm sac after endovascular grafting has been the subject of significant speculation. The importance of sac behavior is manifested by the correlation between aneurysm size or size change and risk for rupture, and potentially further extrapolated to define the need for secondary intervention. This study was undertaken to define graft-specific differences and the effect of endoleak on sac remodeling.\nCore laboratory data were obtained for three US Phase II clinical trials. Patients were included if they met anatomic inclusion criteria and underwent placement of the latest version of a bifurcated endovascular prosthesis. Unsupported Dacron (Ancure), supported Dacron (Zenith), and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (Excluder) grafts were evaluated. Digitized images were electronically assessed for aneurysm size (area, maximum, minimum diameter) with National Institutes of Health Image software. Two blinded reviewers analyzed each radiographic study to ensure accurate image selection and establish the presence or absence of endoleak. A third reviewer adjudicated discrepancies. chi(2) analysis and mixed nonlinear modeling were used to analyze the results.\nOf 1506 patients evaluated, 723 (227 Ancure, 343 Excluder, 153 Zenith) met inclusion criteria for the study. Mean follow-up was 23.2 months (Ancure, 31.3 months; Excluder, 19.6 months; Zenith, 19.3 months). The incidence of any endoleak was 39.1% (Ancure, 58.1%; Excluder, 34.7%; Zenith, 20.9%; P <.001). Type of prosthesis, presence or absence of endoleak, and baseline size were determinants of rate of aneurysm shrinkage. Reduction in sac size was greatest with the Zenith graft, followed by the Ancure and Excluder grafts. Presence of endoleak had a moderating effect on rate of sac shrinkage with the Zenith and Ancure grafts; however, sac size increased in the presence of endoleak with the Excluder graft. Finally, baseline size was positively correlated with rate of aneurysm shrinkage.\nThe behavior of the aneurysm sac depends on the type of prosthesis, presence or absence of endoleak, and baseline size of the sac. Differential sac behavior must be considered when determining the need for secondary interventions, timing follow-up studies, and assessing success or failure of endovascular repair.",

    "abstract": "Transilluminated powered phlebectomy (TriVex) is a new surgical technique that uses tumescent dissection, transillumination, and powered phlebectomy. The purpose of this study was to compare TriVex with conventional varicose vein surgery in terms of pain, cosmesis, recurrence, complications, and operating time.\nOne hundred eighty-eight limbs in 141 patients (33 men, 108 women; mean age, 42.5 years) with varicose veins were randomised to conventional (n = 100) or TriVex (n = 88). Exclusion criteria were venous ulceration or deep venous disease. Varicosities were graded with CEAP and clinical assessment (grades 1-3), and were similar in both groups. Randomization was single blinded. Long or short saphenous vein ligation or stripping was performed as indicated with duplex scanning. Operative time was from skin incision to leg bandaging. Phlebectomy was performed with conventional stab avulsions or TriVex. Patients completed assessment forms preoperatively and postoperatively (2, 6, 26, 52 weeks), and this was supplemented with physician clinical evaluation. Pain was assessed with visual analog score.\nThere was a significant difference in the number of incisions for phlebectomy in the two groups (conventional, n = 29; TriVex, n = 5; P <.0001). TriVex was faster in the grade 3 (extensive) group, but this did not reach statistical significance. There was no difference in mean postoperative pain score over 8 days in the two groups (P =.4624). At 2 weeks there was no significant difference between the groups with regard to bruising (P =.77), cellulitis (P =.33), and numbness (P =.33). At 6 weeks there was no significant difference between the groups with regard to nerve injury (P =.97), residual veins (P =.79), cosmetic score (P =.837), and overall satisfaction (P =.878). At 6 and 12 months, there was no significant difference in cosmesis (P =.955, P =.088, respectively) or recurrence (P =.27, P =.11, respectively).\nTriVex is a safe and effective method for excision of varicosities and compares well, after a learning curve, with conventional surgery in regard to complications and recurrence. It has the advantage of a trend toward reduced operating time in extensive varicosities, and significantly fewer incisions, although there was no perceived difference in cosmesis during follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Deterioration of calf muscle pump function is associated with progression of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). We postulated that a supervised exercise program would improve calf muscle strength and venous hemodynamics in patients with CVI.\nWe recruited 31 patients for this randomized, prospective trial. Inclusion criteria required the presence of skin changes or ulceration (CEAP 4, 5, 6), and duplex ultrasound scanning (reflux or scarring) and air plethysmographic (APG) evidence of CVI. Subjects were randomized into control (n = 13) and therapy (n = 18) groups. Class II (30-40 mm Hg) compression hosiery was given to all. The experimental group received physical therapy designed specifically to strengthen calf musculature. Dynamic strength and power were measured with a Biodex II dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY) at slow and fast speeds. Reflux (venous filling index) and calf pump function (ejection fraction, residual volume fraction) were measured with APG. Quality-of-life questionnaires and venous severity scores were also administered. Outcomes were compared 6 months after initiation of exercise. Probability of treatment effect was tested with univariate analysis of variance, with control for baseline values.\nDemographic variables and medical comorbidities were not different between groups. After 6 months of intervention, indicators of calf pump function returned to a normal range in the therapy (experimental) group. Mean residual volume fraction was improved in the exercise group (-8.75 +/- 4.6 vs 3.4 +/- 2.9 in the control group; P <.029). Mean ejection fraction was increased in the exercise group (3.48 +/- 2.7 vs -1.4 +/- 2.1 in the control group; P <.026). Reflux, while substantially greater than the normal value of 2.0 mL/s in both groups, was unchanged. The exercise regimen improved isokinetic peak torque/body weight at both slow speed (3.1 +/- 1.4 in the therapy group vs -1.0 +/- 1.1 in the control group; P <.05) and fast speed (2.8 +/- 0.9 in the therapy group vs - 0.3 +/- 0.6 in the control group; P <.03). No changes were observed in quality-of-life or severity scores.\nCalf muscle pump function and dynamic calf muscle strength were improved after a 6-month program of structured exercise. Directed physical conditioning of the calf musculature may prove beneficial for patients with or without alternative management options for severe CVI. Further research on exercise for patients with CVI is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Hemodialysis access is one of the most common vascular procedures that is performed by vascular and general surgeons. Prosthetic arteriovenous graft (AVG) infections pose potentially life-threatening septic and bleeding complications, as well as loss of dialysis access. Strategies employed to preserve some grafts, prevent morbidity in those with major infections, and maintain access are presented.\nBetween July 1, 1995 and August 1, 2002, 1441 AVG procedures were performed at a single institution. Fifty-one (3.5%) prosthetic AVG infections in 45 patients were identified. Twenty-seven graft infections occurred at a prior incision for placement or revision of a graft. The other 24 infections were located within the body of the graft, and 14 of these were documented to be at a recent puncture site for hemodialysis access. The most common presentation (47% [24/51]) was an exposed graft or a draining sinus tract. Management included total graft excision (TGE) when patients presented with sepsis or the entire graft was bathed in pus; subtotal graft excision (SGE), when all of the graft was removed except an oversewn small cuff of prosthetic material on an underlying patent artery; and partial graft excision (PGE), when only a limited infected portion of the graft was removed and a new graft was rerouted through adjacent sterile tissue to maintain patency of the original graft.\nNone of the 45 patients died or developed hand ischemia. A uniformly successful outcome was achieved in all patients who were treated with TGE (13/13: 8 vein patches, 4 primary closure, 1 arterial ligation) or SGE (15/15). However, these treatments necessitated placement of a central venous catheter for temporary dialysis access and a new AVG later. All of these 28 wounds healed by secondary intention, including all 15 cases in which an oversewn cuff of prosthetic material remained. Graft patency and wound healing were achieved in 74% (17/23) of infections treated with PGE, and placement of a temporary dialysis access catheter and new AVG were avoided. The 6 failures of PGE ultimately required TGE because of nonhealing wounds, but there were no acute hemorrhagic or septic events.\nSystemic sepsis caused by prosthetic AVG infections mandates TGE. SGE and PGE can be safely employed in selected patients with infected prosthetic AVGs. SGE maintains patency of the underlying artery and avoids a difficult and time-consuming dissection. PGE offers the advantage of minimizing extensive dissection of well-incorporated uninfected graft segments and allows continued dialysis access at the incorporated portion of the graft.",

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing operations to treat peripheral vascular disease have systemic atherosclerosis and are at risk for stroke. However, the incidence and effect of cerebrovascular events on noncarotid vascular surgical outcomes are not well-defined.\nPatients undergoing common operations for vascular disease from 1997 to 2000 were examined with data from the Veterans Affairs (VA) National Surgery Quality Improvement Project and the VA patient treatment files. Operations studied included abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy (n = 2551), aortobifemoral bypass (n = 2616), lower extremity bypass (n = 6866), and major lower extremity amputation (n = 7442). The incidence of perioperative stroke was determined, and logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for stroke. Logistic and linear regression analyses were used to quantify the effect of postoperative stroke on adjusted mortality and length of stay. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were defined. P <.05 was considered significant.\nStroke was uncommon after noncarotid vascular procedures, occurring in only 0.4% to 0.6% of patients. Independent risk factors for stroke include preoperative ventilation (OR, 11; 95% CI, 5.0-22.3; P <.001), previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 2.7-6.4; P <.001), postoperative myocardial infarction (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3-8.7; P =.009), and need to return to the operating room (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4-3.5; P =.001). Factors that did not appear to be associated with stroke risk included procedure type, diabetes, renal failure, dialysis dependence, number of transfused units of blood, and hypertension. After controlling for other postoperative complications and comorbid conditions, postoperative stroke significantly increased the risk for perioperative mortality (OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 3.4-11.4; P <.001), with similar magnitude as postoperative myocardial infarction (OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 3.9-10.1; P <.001). Stroke was also associated with a 48% increase in overall length of stay.\nStroke after noncarotid peripheral vascular surgery is uncommon, but results in markedly increased mortality and length of stay. Stroke risk is most strongly associated with previous stroke history and greater degree of illness. Patients with these associated conditions deserve particular attention to assessing and medically managing modifiable risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) velocity criteria have not been well-established for patients undergoing carotid artery stenting (CAS). A potential source of error in using US after CAS is that reduced compliance in the stented artery may result in elevated velocity relative to the native artery. We measured arterial compliance in the stented artery, and developed customized velocity criteria for use early after CAS.\nUS was performed before and within 3 days after CAS, and after 1 month in a subset of 26 patients. Post-procedural peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) of the internal carotid artery (ICA), PSV/EDV ratio, and internal carotid artery to common carotid artery ratio (ICA/CCA) were recorded. These were compared with degree of in-stent residual stenosis determined at carotid angiography performed at the completion of CAS. Peterson's elastic modulus (Ep) and compliance (Cp) of the ICA were determined in a subgroup of 20 patients at the distal end of the stent and in the same region in the native ICA before stenting.\nNinety CAS procedures were analyzed. Mean (+/-SD) angiographic residual stenosis after CAS was 5.4 +/- 9.1%, whereas corresponding PSV by US was 120.4 +/- 32.4 cm/s; EDV, 41.4 +/- 18.6 cm/s; PSV/EDV ratio, 3.3 +/- 1.2; and ICA/CCA ratio, 1.6 +/- 0.5. PSV was unchanged at 1 month. Post-CAS PSV and ICA/CCA ratio correlated most with degree of stenosis (P <.0001 for both). Only six patients demonstrated in-stent residual stenosis 20% or greater, but the standard US threshold of PSV 130 cm/s or greater (validated for >20% ICA stenosis in our laboratory) categorized 38 of 90 patients as having stenosis 20% or greater. Receiver operator curve analysis demonstrated that a combined threshold of PSV 150 cm/s or greater and ICA/CCA ratio 2.16 or greater were optimal for detecting residual stenosis of 20% or greater, with sensitivity 100%, specificity 98%, positive predictive value 75%, and negative predictive value 100%. After placement of a stent, the ICA demonstrated significantly increased Ep (1.2 vs 4.4 x 10(3) mm Hg; P =.004) and decreased Cp (9.8 vs 3.2 %mm Hg x 10(-2); P =.0004).\nCurrently accepted US velocity criteria validated in our laboratory for nonstented ICAs falsely classified several stented ICAs with normal diameter on carotid angiograms as having residual in-stent stenosis 20% or greater. We propose a new criterion that defines PSV less than 150 cm/s, with ICA/CCA ratio less than 2.16, as the best correlate to a normal lumen (0%-19% stenosis) in the recently stented ICA. This was associated with increased stiffness of the stented ICA (increased Ep, decreased Cp). These preliminary results suggest that placement of a stent in the carotid artery alters its biomechanical properties, which may cause an increase in US velocity measurements in the absence of a technical error or residual stenotic disease.",

    "abstract": "Although the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) have helped to define the role of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for both symptomatic and asymptomatic lesions, the role of surveillance of the contralateral carotid artery remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the progression of contralateral carotid artery disease with serial duplex ultrasound scans after CEA compared with the recurrent stenosis rate for the carotid artery ipsilateral to the CEA.\nFrom January 1990 to December 2000, 473 CEA procedures were performed at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. From this group we identified 279 patients who had undergone first-time CEA, as well as preoperative duplex scanning and postoperative duplex scanning at least once, in the vascular laboratory. At each visit stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) was categorized as none (0%-14%), mild (15%-49%), moderate (50%-79%), severe (80%-99%), or occluded. Analysis of probability of freedom from progression was determined. Progression was defined as an increase in ICA stenosis 50% or greater or increase to a higher category of stenosis if baseline was 50% or greater. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for data analysis.\nMean patient age was 65.7 years (range, 33-100 years). The 1024 carotid duplex ultrasound scanning examinations performed (mean, 3.7; range, 2-13) included the last study done before the index CEA and all studies done after the CEA. Mean follow-up was 27 months (range, 1-137 months). Forty-six patients were found to have contralateral carotid occlusion at initial duplex scanning, and were therefore excluded from the contralateral progression analysis. Contralateral progression was more frequent than ipsilateral recurrent stenosis at long-term follow-up (P <.01). Annual rates of \"any progression\" and \"progression to severe stenosis or occlusion\" were 8.3% and 4.4%, respectively, for contralateral arteries, and 4.3% and 2.4%, respectively for ipsilateral arteries. As a result of surveillance, 43 contralateral CEAs (19% of initial cohort) were performed. Carotid stenosis regressed in 25 arteries (10.7%). Baseline clinical and demographic factors did not predict disease progression. Baseline contralateral stenosis did not predict time to \"any progression,\" but was a strong predictor of \"progression to severe stenosis or occlusion\" (P <.001).\nAfter CEA, we identified an 8.3% annual rate of progression of contralateral carotid artery stenosis and a 4.4% annual rate of progression to severe stenosis or occlusion. Baseline contralateral stenosis was significantly predictive of progression to severe stenosis or occlusion. Clinical and demographic factors were not helpful in predicting which patients would have disease progression. These data may help in assessing the cost effectiveness of duplex scanning surveillance after CEA.",

The 1024 carotid duplex ultrasound scanning examinations performed (mean, 3.7; range, 2-13) included the last study done before the index CEA and all studies done after the CEA. Mean follow-up was 27 months (range, 1-137 months). Forty-six patients were found to have contralateral carotid occlusion at initial duplex scanning, and were therefore excluded from the contralateral progression analysis. Contralateral progression was more frequent than ipsilateral recurrent stenosis at long-term follow-up (P <.01). Annual rates of \"any progression\" and \"progression to severe stenosis or occlusion\" were 8.3% and 4.4%, respectively, for contralateral arteries, and 4.3% and 2.4%, respectively for ipsilateral arteries. As a result of surveillance, 43 contralateral CEAs (19% of initial cohort) were performed. Carotid stenosis regressed in 25 arteries (10.7%). Baseline clinical and demographic factors did not predict disease progression. Baseline contralateral stenosis did not predict time to \"any progression,\" but was a strong predictor of \"progression to severe stenosis or occlusion\" (P <.001).",

    "abstract": "Stroke puts a major financial burden on our healthcare system. However, carotid duplex scanning performed as a screening test for occult carotid artery stenosis (CAS) currently is not reimbursed by Medicare. The goals of this study were to develop a cost-effective stroke screening program, to determine the prevalence of potential causes of stroke in this population, and to define a population at high risk in which screening would be most effective.\nIn a community-based stroke screening program, patients were eligible if they were older than 60 years and had a history of either hypertension, heart disease, or cigarette smoking, or a family history of stroke. Screening included blood pressure determination, an electrocardiographic rhythm strip, and a previously validated modified carotid duplex ultrasound examination to detect CAS 50% or greater. The relationships between standard demographic risk factors and screening outcomes were analyzed.\nScreening was performed in 610 patients. Unilateral or bilateral CAS was detected in 66 patients (10.8%). The finding of occult CAS was more prevalent than that of new hypertension (2.6%) or new atrial fibrillation (0.5%). Patients with known hypertension were significantly more likely to have CAS than were those without hypertension (12.7% vs 7.8%; P =.05). Patients with heart disease were significantly more likely to have CAS than were those without heart disease (18.2% vs 8%; P <.0001). Patients with both risk factors were significantly more likely to have occult carotid artery disease than were patients without either risk factor (22.1% vs 8.5%; P <.0001). Multivariate analysis with logistic regression revealed a history of heart disease as an independent predictor of occult carotid artery disease (odds ratio 95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.4). Type of heart disease was not a significant factor in predicting occult CAS. Direct cost of the screening, including community outreach, nurses, technicians, support staff, and miscellaneous expenses, was less than $75 per patient.\nIn a screening program for treatable causes of potential stroke, CAS was the most commonly diagnosed disease. More than one of every five patients with known hypertension and heart disease had occult CAS. Known heart disease of any type was a significant independent predictor of occult CAS. Screening for treatable causes of potential stroke can be cost-effective. This information could help to further target populations to screen for occult CAS and to justify reimbursement for screening carotid duplex scanning examinations.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to assess the results of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair with the Lifepath abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) graft system.\nIn a prospective clinical trial, 23 centers used the Lifepath System balloon-expandable, modular bifurcated stent graft for elective endovascular aortic aneurysm repair. Stent grafts were sized according to computed tomographic angiography-based diameter measurements. All repairs were performed in the operating room through bilateral surgically exposed femoral arteries. Results were assessed with contrast agent-enhanced computed tomography scans and plain abdominal x-ray films at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months postoperatively.\nOver 52 months (mean follow-up, 11 months), 227 patients (206 men, 21 women) were enrolled. Technical implant success rate was 98.7%. There were five (2.2%) conversions to open surgery: two emergently because of aortic perforation; to treat refractory endoleak, immediate in one and at 12 months in one; and to replace a device with wireform fractures that had migrated at 12 months, resulting in a proximal endoleak. The perioperative mortality rate was 1.3%. There was one operative death during a secondary procedure to repair perforation of the aorta. There were two perioperative deaths, from postoperative myocardial infarction (n = 1) and pulmonary embolus (n = 1). There were 12 late deaths, from coronary artery disease (n = 4), cancer (n = 2), respiratory failure (n = 2), sepsis (n = 1), or unknown cause (n = 3). Median length of stay was 2 days (mean, 4 days). There have been no AAA ruptures after successful implantation of the device, no graft limb thromboses, and no limb dislocations. At the time of operation endoleak was noted in 43 (19%) patients, but by 6 months this was reduced to 8 (5.9%) patients (type I, n = 1; type II, n = 7). There were no type III or type IV endoleaks. Secondary interventions to treat endoleaks included open conversion (n = 2), placement of extension cuffs (n = 4), repeated balloon dilation (n = 3), and coil embolization (n = 6). The two remaining secondary interventions were emergent treatment of postoperative bleeding from a groin incision, and a colon resection because of postoperative colonic ischemia, for a 12-month secondary intervention rate of 7.5%. Wireform fractures were noted in the first generation Lifepath device in 37 of 79 (47%) patients. Graft migration (>10 mm) was observed in five patients (2.2%), each of whom also had two or more fractures of the proximal anchoring wireforms. Migration resulted in a proximal attachment endoleak in one patient. In response to wireform fractures, the device was modified after the initial 79 patients were enrolled. Wireform fracture has been observed in six patients since this modification (4%), and in only one patient did this involve fracture of a proximal anchoring wireform; none of these patients has had endoleak or graft migration. By 12 months, mean aneurysm diameter was noted to decrease by 9 mm (P <.0001), and mean aneurysm volume by 42 mL (P <.0001) from the preoperative visit.\nThe Lifepath System demonstrates a low endoleak and secondary intervention rate and high sac regression rate, compared with other devices. The unique balloon-expandable design offers the advantages of precise placement and high radial force. The device appears to be highly resistant to limb thrombosis and modular component separation. Patients were protected from AAA rupture after successful device implantation, and demonstrated significant reduction in AAA diameter and volume. Fractures of the wireforms of the main body of the device have been observed. Careful long-term follow-up is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Several types of endoleaks have been described, each with different methods of treatment. Conventional arteriography is widely regarded as the gold standard for the classification of endoleaks. Recently, faster magnetic resonance gradients have allowed for rapid data acquisition and review of vascular studies as a real-time continuous angiogram (time resolved magnetic resonance angiography [TR-MRA]). This study was performed to compare the findings of TR-MRA with conventional angiography for the characterization of endoleaks.\nBetween June 2002 and June 2003, 12 patients with documented endoleaks following endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms (10 abdominal and two thoracic) underwent TR-MRA to identify and characterize the endoleak. All patients had nitinol-based aortic stent grafts. MRA was performed on a 1.5-Tesla magnet (Sonata class; Siemens Medical Systems, Iselin, NJ). The TR-MRA studies were reviewed under continuous observation as a \"cine MR angiogram.\" These MRA data sets were used to classify the endoleaks into types 1 through 3. The patients underwent conventional angiography following the MRA to confirm the findings and to plan treatment. The MRA findings were compared with the findings made at conventional arteriography.\nTR-MRA identified seven patients with type 1 leaks, including four proximal and three distal. Four patients had type 2 leaks, including two arising from the inferior mesenteric artery and two from an iliolumbar artery. One patient had a type 3 leak. Conventional angiography confirmed the type of endoleak in all 12 patients.\nThese initial results demonstrate TR-MRA to be an effective noninvasive method for classifying endoleaks. This technique may allow for screening of patients with endoleaks to identify those requiring urgent repair.",

    "abstract": "Generous endograft oversizing has been associated with propensity for aortic neck dilation and subsequent device migration in endografts without suprarenal fixation. Effects of variable oversizing of endografts with suprarenal fixation have been poorly studied.\nThree hundred fifty-one patients underwent endovascular AAA repair (EVAR) in a prospective multicenter trial using the Zenith AAA Endovascular Graft, a fully supported bifurcated 3-piece endograft with barb-enhanced suprarenal stent fixation. Blinded core-laboratory measurement of variables was prospectively recorded at predischarge and at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months after the procedure. Potential influence of endograft oversizing on subsequent aortic neck dilation (minor axis), aneurysm shrinkage (major axis), device migration, endoleak, rupture, open conversion, and death were retrospectively studied. Data are given as mean +/- SEM.\nRisk of endograft migration (>5mm) at 12 months was 2.3% (6/261). However, patients with endograft oversizing of >30% had a 14% (4/29) migration risk compared with those oversized < or =30% (0.9%, 2/232), P <.002. There was zero device migration by the SVS definition (>10 mm or clinical event). Device oversizing >30% was associated with decreased AAA sac shrinkage (48% vs 77%) and with increased sac enlargement (9.5% vs 0.6%) at 24 months when compared with oversizing of < or =30%, respectively (P =.001). Incidence rate of any endoleak at 12 and 24 months was 8.2% (21/256) and 7.1% (12/169), respectively. Oversizing of endografts by >30% was associated with an increased type II endoleak rate (11 vs 4.7%) that failed to reach statistical significance (P =.27). Aortic neck diameters increased significantly by 6 months (P <.001) but then stabilized through 24 months; the absolute changes at 1 (n = 298), 6 (n = 278), 12 (n = 264), and 24 months (n = 171) were 0.66 +/- 0.10 mm (3.0%), 1.32 +/- 0.11 mm (5.6%), 1.38 +/- 0.12 mm (5.9%), and 1.44 +/- 0.16 mm (6.1%), respectively. Linear regression analysis demonstrated no correlation between endograft oversizing and aortic neck dilation at 12 (P =.86) or 24 months (P =.64).\nDevice migration and endoleaks were very infrequent after treatment with the Zenith AAA Endovascular Graft. However, endograft oversizing of >30% was associated with an approximately 14-fold increase in device migration (>5 mm) at 12 months and with a approximately 16-fold increased risk of AAA expansion at 24 months. Although further follow-up will be essential to assess whether these early associations continue, avoidance of excessive endograft oversizing is recommended.",

    "results": "Risk of endograft migration (>5mm) at 12 months was 2.3% (6/261). However, patients with endograft oversizing of >30% had a 14% (4/29) migration risk compared with those oversized < or =30% (0.9%, 2/232), P <.002. There was zero device migration by the SVS definition (>10 mm or clinical event). Device oversizing >30% was associated with decreased AAA sac shrinkage (48% vs 77%) and with increased sac enlargement (9.5% vs 0.6%) at 24 months when compared with oversizing of < or =30%, respectively (P =.001). Incidence rate of any endoleak at 12 and 24 months was 8.2% (21/256) and 7.1% (12/169), respectively. Oversizing of endografts by >30% was associated with an increased type II endoleak rate (11 vs 4.7%) that failed to reach statistical significance (P =.27). Aortic neck diameters increased significantly by 6 months (P <.001) but then stabilized through 24 months; the absolute changes at 1 (n = 298), 6 (n = 278), 12 (n = 264), and 24 months (n = 171) were 0.66 +/- 0.10 mm (3.0%), 1.32 +/- 0.11 mm (5.6%), 1.38 +/- 0.12 mm (5.9%), and 1.44 +/- 0.16 mm (6.1%), respectively.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare survival and outcomes of endovascular versus open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in New York State (NYS).\nWe used the NYS discharge dataset Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) to analyze the outcomes of elective admission for nonruptured (International Classification of Diseases-9th revision [ICD-9] 441.4) open aneurysm repair (38.44) and endovascular aneurysm repair (39.71) during the years 2000-2002. The ICD-9 code for endovascular repair was introduced in late 2000, thus capturing 3 months of empiric data for 2000.\nThere has been a significant increase in the number of AAA procedures performed in NYS (comparing before and after 2000: average, 1419 vs 1701; P =.0001), temporally coinciding with the implementation of training programs after US Food and Drug Administration approval of endovascular grafts and the new payment code. From 2000 to 2002 the number of NYS hospitals performing endovascular repairs increased from 24 to 60. By 2002 there were more endovascular repairs being performed than open repairs (871 vs 783). The target population for these surgical interventions showed interesting differences. In 2002, women had a 43% chance of receiving an endograft, whereas men had a 55% probability. The use of endovascular repair over the observation period was relatively constant in patients younger than 65 years. In patients older than 65 years, and especially those older than 75 years, endovascular use increased substantially, so that by 2002 older patients were more likely to undergo endovascular repair than open repair. Patients who underwent endovascular repair had significantly more hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia than did patients who underwent open repair. Yet the mean length of stay for endovascular procedures was approximately 3.6 days, and for open procedures was about 10.3 days, across all 3 years (P = <.0001). Moreover, patients who underwent endovascular repair had statistically fewer postoperative complications and significantly lower mortality. In-hospital mortality in 2001 was 3.55% for open repair and 1.14% for endovascular repair (P =.0018), and in 2002 these rates were 4.21% versus 0.8% (P <.0001), respectively.\nThis dataset suggests that endovascular AAA repairs are being performed in a patient population with a higher frequency of comorbidities. However, endovascular repairs still are associated with significantly lower in-hospital mortality, fewer postoperative complications, and a dramatically shorter length of stay. These results suggest that, despite the rapid diffusion of this new technique, early perioperative outcomes may be superior to those with conventional open repair. However, prospective clinical studies are needed to confirm these insights, and such studies may require the infrastructure of consortia of hospitals or society-based registries.",

    "abstract": "There has been increasing recognition of the detrimental effect of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) on the health of Americans, and yet there is no common national program of public PAD education designed to diminish this effect. FORMAT: To heighten awareness of this problem, a 2-day PAD Public Education Strategy Meeting was recently attended by representatives of 17 professional societies and public health associations whose missions support the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of vascular diseases. This Public Education Strategy Meeting was intended to provide the rationale and structure to create a national PAD public awareness campaign to diminish the health effect of PAD and to improve cardiovascular outcomes in the United States. This document (1). provides the rationale for creation of a national PAD public education program; (2). reviews the development and success of national hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and Women's Heart Health public education programs as models of educational efficacy; (3). elucidates how the work of many vascular professionals has led to a national consensus for creation of a national PAD public educational program; (4). provides an overview of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute PAD education meeting; and (5). outlines the \"next steps\" required to accomplish these goals.\nThis meeting achieved consensus that we share responsibility for developing accurate, unified messages to promote PAD awareness and improved care. Participants agreed that the creation of such messages should be linked to plans to disseminate them to all Americans at risk. A consensus was reached that such messages, when commonly created and offered to the public, are most likely to achieve the rewards in better health that all Americans deserve. The Vascular Disease Foundation, a not-for-profit foundation whose mission includes public education about the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of PAD, will devote its resources to guide a new coalition in this process and to create a national PAD awareness campaign. During 2003 and 2004, the coalition will create the organizational underpinnings and time line for what will undoubtedly be a multiyear effort.\nParticipants of the Public Education Strategy Meeting agreed to create a broad coalition to develop a National PAD Public Awareness Program, with the objectives to develop and disseminate public education massages on PAD. A successful national PAD education program will contribute to creation of a broader mandate to improve global cardiovascular health in the United States.",

Aneurysms of the superior mesenteric vein are rare, and their origin is unknown. Many aneurysms are asymptomatic, and the diagnosis is established from radiologic findings. Others are diagnosed after complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or thrombosis with associated abdominal pain. Because of the rarity of this disease and consequent absence of standard treatment, therapy must be adapted to fit each case. We present a case report of an aneurysm of the superior mesenteric vein.

    "abstract": "The activation of inflammatory cells and the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Previous studies have demonstrated that the antiplatelet agent trapidil has multiple actions, including suppression of MMP expression through the inhibition of the CD40-CD40 ligand (CD40-CD40L) pathway in cultured cells. A recent clinical study suggested that trapidil might have functions beyond its antiplatelet action. Methods and results In the present study, we performed immunohistochemical analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the effect of trapidil on the production of MMPs in cultured aortic tissues from patients with infrarenal AAA (n = 9) and control patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease (n = 7). The tissue concentrations of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 were significantly higher in AAA walls than in control aortic walls. Both trapidil and an anti-CD154 (CD40L) antibody significantly suppressed the protein production and mRNA expression of MMP-2 but did not inhibit those of MMP-9 in organ cultures of AAA wall specimens. MMP-9 was produced by macrophages and a lot of neutrophils in AAA tissues, whereas MMP-2 was derived from macrophages. CD40 was expressed on macrophages but not on neutrophils, and this expression could explain the differential effect of trapidil on the production of MMP-2 and MMP-9.\nTrapidil, a CD40-CD40L pathway inhibitor, suppressed mRNA expression and protein production of MMP-2 in AAA tissues, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for the prevention or treatment of AAA.",

    "abstract": "Although current treatments for restenosis attempt to prevent the development of intimal hyperplasia, an alternative strategy is to induce intimal atrophy after restenosis has developed. Because platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a smooth muscle cell growth and survival factor, we tested the hypothesis that complete blockade of PDGF by using antibodies against PDGF receptors alpha and beta would cause intimal atrophy in a baboon vascular graft model.\nWe administered chimeric antibodies against PDGF receptor alpha or PDGF receptor beta, either separately or together, to baboons with bilateral prosthetic aortoiliac grafts, the intimas of which had reached maximal size before treatment was begun. High blood flow, which we have previously shown to cause intimal atrophy, was induced through one graft to serve as a positive control. After 2 weeks, the intima lining the grafts was assessed for cross-sectional area, cell proliferation, and apoptosis by standard morphologic and immunohistochemical techniques.\nBlocking both PDGF receptors simultaneously reduced the cross-sectional area of the normal-flow graft intima by 44% (P <.05 vs control), whereas treatment with the individual antibodies did not significantly alter intimal area. Blockade of both receptors also inhibited smooth muscle cell proliferation by 66% (P <.05 vs control), whereas neither antibody alone altered proliferation. In contrast, all treatments increased smooth muscle cell apoptosis threefold to fivefold.\nThese data suggest that simultaneous inhibition of cell proliferation and stimulation of cell death by the administration of antibodies to both PDGF receptor alpha and receptor beta is required for intimal atrophy in this baboon graft model. In addition, these data provide an in vivo model for the pharmacologic induction of intimal atrophy and introduce a novel clinical approach to treat intimal hyperplasia. Clinical relevance This study introduces the concept of pharmacologic induction of intimal atrophy. Intimal hyperplasia plagues all forms of arterial reconstruction. Currently, the only effective treatment of these restenotic lesions is balloon angioplasty or operative revision. An alternative approach to patients with clinically significant intimal hyperplasia might be to stimulate intimal regression by modulating growth and survival factors required for intimal maintenance. Although PDGF is known to be critical in intimal formation, the results of this study suggest that PDGF is also critical for intimal maintenance. Inhibition of the PDGF system may prove to be a clinically applicable approach for inducing intimal atrophy.",

    "abstract": "The patency of arteriovenous (AV) polytetrafluoroethylene grafts for hemodialysis is impaired by intimal hyperplasia (IH) at the venous outflow tract. IH mainly consists of vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and extracellular matrix proteins. Because matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are enzymes able to degrade extracellular matrix proteins such as elastin and collagen and also stimulate migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, we hypothesized that BB2983 (a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor) could reduce IH in AV grafts.\nIn 12 pigs, AV grafts were created bilaterally between the carotid artery and the jugular vein. Six pigs received the oral MMP inhibitor (MMPi), and six pigs served as a control. Four weeks after AV shunting, the grafts and adjacent vessels were excised and underwent histologic analysis. Quantification of elastin content was performed on Elastin von Gieson-stained sections.\nAt the venous outflow tract, IH was strongly inhibited after MMPi when compared with the control group (1.02 +/- 0.26 mm(2) vs 2.14 +/- 0.38 mm(2); P =.027). The medial area did not differ significantly. In the control group elastin density decreased compared with nonoperated veins. This decrease was not observed in the MMPi group (nonoperated, 6.3% +/- 0.4%; MMPi, 7.2% +/- 0.7% vs untreated, 3.6% +/- 0.5%; P =.0004). Outward remodeling of the vein was not influenced by MMP inhibition.\nMMPi reduces IH formation at the venous outflow tract of AV grafts in pigs, probably by inhibiting elastin degradation. These data suggest that MMP inhibitors might be useful for minimizing IH in AV grafts, thus prolonging patency rates of AV grafts in patients on hemodialysis.",

From January 1987 to January 2002, 69 patients underwent PTA of an isolated stenosis of the lower abdominal aorta under local anesthesia in the department of interventional radiology. All atherosclerotic lesions were hemodynamically significant, defined as a subjective report of walking distance less than one block, resting pain, or trophic changes in combination with diameter reduction of 50% or greater at duplex ultrasound scanning and angiography.\nThe female-male ratio of study patients was 3.6:1; mean age was 58 years. Endovascular treatment was initially technically and clinically successful in all but one patient (98%), who had a near total occlusion. No major complications were noted. Mean follow-up was 57 months (range, 6 months-15 years). At life table analysis, 5-year primary patency was 75%, and secondary patency was 97%. Twelve patients (17%) required repeat interventions because of hemodynamically significant recurrent stenosis in combination with severe clinical symptoms. Most recurrent stenoses (67%) were successfully treated with repeat endovascular procedures.\nEarly and long-term results of PTA (with additional stent placement) of isolated stenosis of the infrarenal aorta are good. This minimally invasive procedure is a true alternative to traditional surgical methods.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of balloon angioplasty in the treatment of failing infrainguinal vein bypass (IVB) grafts.\nA retrospective chart review of patients undergoing revision of a failing IVB graft by vascular surgeons at a tertiary care center from 1990 to 2001 was performed. Failing bypass grafts were identified by routine duplex scan surveillance and physical examination. The criteria for endovascular intervention varied on the basis of surgeon preferences and time period; factors considered when choosing balloon angioplasty included significant comorbidities that precluded operative intervention, the lack of adequate conduit for surgical revision, or poor accessibility of the stenotic lesion. Data recorded included demographic patient data, type of IVB graft, patency status, further procedures performed, and all complications and mortalities. Cumulative primary and assisted patency rates were calculated by using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis.\nA total of 45 balloon angioplasties were performed in 36 patients. There were 36 angioplasties of vein bypass grafts, and additional balloon angioplasties were performed on nine of these patients. Locations of IVB grafts included femoropopliteal (13 patients), femorodistal (13), and popliteal to distal (10). Initial success was achieved in 33 of 36 vein bypass grafts (91.7%). In these bypass grafts, the stenotic lesions were identified and treated at the proximal anastomosis (3 patients), mid-bypass graft (6 patients), and distal anastomosis (27 patients). Autogenous vein was used for all bypass grafts. Cumulative vein bypass graft (life-table analysis) primary patency rates (those free of occlusion or bypass graft threatening stenosis) were 74.2% at 6 months, 62.7% at 12 months, and 58.2% at 24 months. Repeat interventions included surgical thrombectomy with vein patch angioplasty or bypass graft revision, as well as repeat balloon angioplasty with or without thrombolysis. Cumulative assisted vein bypass graft patency rates (those free of occlusion or bypass graft threatening stenosis) were 87.0%, 83.2%, and 78.9% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Two patients (4%) developed thigh hematomas; no other procedure-related complications were noted, and there were no deaths in the perioperative period.\nBalloon angioplasty of failing infrainguinal vein bypass grafts can be successfully performed with a low rate of complications.

We analyzed the effect of intraoperative duplex scanning in detection of significant but clinically unsuspected technical defects and residual common carotid artery (CCA) disease as a potential source of postoperative transitory ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke.\nFrom April 2000 to April 2003, 650 consecutive primary carotid endarterectomy procedures were performed in 590 patients at a single institution by two vascular surgeons. Patients included 335 men (57%) and 255 women (43%). Indications for surgery were asymptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis (>or=70%) in 464 patients (71%). All procedures were performed with the patient under general anesthesia, with synthetic patch angioplasty in 644 (99.1%). Major technical defects at intraoperative duplex scanning (>30% luminal internal carotid artery stenosis, free-floating clot, dissection, arterial disruption with pseudoaneurysm) were repaired. CCA residual disease was reported as wall thickness (0.7-4.8 mm; mean, 1.7 +/- 0.7) and percent stenosis (16%-67%; mean, 32% +/- 8%) in all cases. Postoperative 30-day TIA, stroke, and death rates were analyzed.\nThere were no clinically detectable postoperative thromboembolic events in this series. All 15 major defects (2.3%) identified with duplex scanning were successfully revised. These included 7 intimal flaps, 4 free-floating clots, 2 ICA stenoses, 1 ICA pseudoaneurysm, and 1 retrograde CCA dissection. Diameter reduction ranged from 40% to 90% (mean, 67 +/- 16%), and peak systolic velocity ranged from 69 to 497 cm/s (mean, 250 +/- 121 cm/s). Thirty-one patients (5%) with the highest residual wall thickness (>3mm) in the CCA and 19 (3%) with the highest CCA residual diameter reduction (>50%) did not have postoperative stroke or TIA. Overall postoperative stroke and mortality rates were 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively; combined stroke and mortality rate was 0.8%. One stroke was caused by hyperperfusion, and the other occurred as an extension of a previous cerebral infarct. No patients had TIAs. Two deaths were caused by myocardial infarction, and one death by respiratory insufficiency.\nWe believe intraoperative duplex scanning had a major role in these improved results, because it enabled detection of clinically unsuspected significant lesions. Residual disease in the CCA does not seem to be a harbinger of stroke or TIA.",

    "abstract": "Radiotherapy to the head and neck often results in carotid stenosis, but the course of disease is unknown. We investigated the natural history and progression of asymptomatic carotid stenosis induced by external irradiation. Patients and methods The study included 130 carotid arteries in 95 patients who had received external radiation therapy to the head and neck area and who had asymptomatic, mild internal carotid artery or common carotid artery stenosis. Stenosis of 15% to 49% on duplex ultrasound (US) scans defined mild (<50%) disease. Another 95 arteries in 74 patients with matched degree of carotid artery stenosis but who had not received radiation therapy were used as control. Both groups were followed up prospectively with serial duplex US scanning, and degree of carotid artery stenosis was categorized as 15% to 49%, 50% to 69%, 70% to 99%, and occlusion. Progression of carotid artery stenosis was defined as increase in stenosis from less than 50% to 50% or greater at ultrasonography. Secondary end points included progression to higher disease category, new cerebrovascular symptoms, and death. Data from irradiated arteries was compared with control data with the life table method. A Cox regression model was used to analyze disease progression, adjusted for covariates of sex, age, smoking, diabetes, and hypertension.\nMean follow-up was 36 months. Adjusted freedom from progression rates at 3 years were 65% for irradiated arteries and 87% for control arteries at life-table analysis (P =.035; odds ratio, 3.1). The annualized progression rate from less than 50% to 50% or greater in irradiated arteries was 15.4%, compared with 4.8% in nonirradiated arteries. A long history of cervical irradiation (>6 years) was the only significant risk factor for disease progression. There was no difference between the two groups regarding development of new symptoms or mortality.\nCarotid stenosis associated with external irradiation progresses more rapidly compared with nonirradiated atherosclerotic arteries. Aggressive surveillance is recommended.",

Data were retrospectively reviewed for 21 (8%) patients with iliac artery aneurysms 25 mm or larger that involved the iliac bifurcation. Patients underwent hypogastric artery bypass (n = 9) or coil embolization (n = 12). Interviews about past and current levels of activity were conducted. A disability score (DS) was quantitatively graded on a discrete scale ranging from 0 to 10, corresponding to \"virtually bed-bound\" to exercise tolerance \"greater than a mile.\" Worsening or improvement of symptoms was expressed as a difference in DS between two time points (-, worsening; +, improvement).\nThere was no difference in age (72.6 +/- 7.3 years vs 73.1 +/- 6.4 years), sex (male-female ratio, 8:1 vs 11:1), abdominal aortic aneurysm size (60.1 +/- 5.9 mm vs 59.3 +/- 7.0 mm), or number of preoperative comorbid conditions (1.9 +/- 0.8 vs 2.1 +/- 0.8) between hypogastric bypass and coil embolization groups, respectively. Mean follow-up was shorter after hypogastric bypass (14.8 vs 20.5 months; P <.05). There was no difference in the mean overall baseline DS between the bypass and the embolization groups (8.0 vs 7.8). Six (50%) of the 12 patients with coil embolization reported symptoms of buttock claudication ipsilateral to the occluded hypogastric artery. No symptoms of buttock claudication were reported after hypogastric bypass (P <.05). There was a decrease in the DS after both procedures; however, coil embolization was associated with a significantly worse DS compared with hypogastric artery bypass (4.5 vs 7.3; P <.001). In 4 (67%) of 6 patients with claudication after coil embolization symptoms improved, with a DS of 5.4 at last follow-up. This was significantly worse than in patients undergoing hypogastric artery bypass, with a DS of 7.8 at last follow-up (P <.001). There was no difference between the groups in duration of procedure, blood loss, length of hospital stay, morbidity, or mortality (0%).\nHypogastric artery bypass to preserve pelvic circulation is safe, and significantly decreases the risk for buttock claudication. Preservation of pelvic circulation results in significant improvement in the ambulatory status of patients with common iliac artery aneurysms, compared with coil embolization.",

Six (50%) of the 12 patients with coil embolization reported symptoms of buttock claudication ipsilateral to the occluded hypogastric artery. No symptoms of buttock claudication were reported after hypogastric bypass (P <.05). There was a decrease in the DS after both procedures; however, coil embolization was associated with a significantly worse DS compared with hypogastric artery bypass (4.5 vs 7.3; P <.001). In 4 (67%) of 6 patients with claudication after coil embolization symptoms improved, with a DS of 5.4 at last follow-up. This was significantly worse than in patients undergoing hypogastric artery bypass, with a DS of 7.8 at last follow-up (P <.001). There was no difference between the groups in duration of procedure, blood loss, length of hospital stay, morbidity, or mortality (0%).",

    "abstract": "Ruptured inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is relatively rare, and little has been written on the outcome of operative treatment.\nPatients undergoing attempted repair of ruptured inflammatory AAA between 1995 and 2001 were included in a retrospective case-cohort study. Demographic, clinical, and operative factors were analyzed, together with in-hospital morbidity, in-hospital mortality, and duration of postoperative hospital stay.\nOf 297 patients who underwent attempted operative repair of ruptured AAA, 24 (8%) had an inflammatory aneurysm. Twenty-two patients were men, and two were women; median age was 69 years (range, 51-85 years). Operative findings revealed a contained hematoma in 16 patients (70%), free rupture in 3 patients (13%), aortocaval fistula in 4 patients (17%), and aortoenteric fistula in 1 patient (4%). Of 273 noninflammatory ruptured AAAs, only 2 AAA (1%) were associated with primary aortic fistula. Ten patients (42%) with inflammatory AAA died in hospital, compared with 117 of 273 patients (43%) without inflammation. Median postoperative stay was 10 days (range, 0-35 days). Of the 14 patients with inflammatory lesions who survived, 11 had postoperative complications; 4 patients had acute renal failure, three of whom required temporary renal replacement therapy.\nRuptured inflammatory AAA is associated with a higher incidence of aortic fistula than is ruptured noninflammatory AAA. Repair of ruptured inflammatory AAA is not associated with increased operative mortality compared with repair of ruptured noninflammatory AAA.",

    "abstract": "Deep thigh veins, including the superficial femoral, superficial femoropopliteal, and profunda femoris veins, are versatile autogenous conduits for arterial reconstruction. Although late venous complications are unusual, deep vein harvest may induce severe venous hypertension and predispose the limb to acute compartment syndrome. The purpose of this study was to define the frequency of fasciotomy in patients undergoing deep vein harvest and to identify clinical predictors of the need for fasciotomy after deep vein harvest.\nOver 9 years, 162 patients underwent arterial reconstruction with deep vein harvested from 264 limbs. Indications for deep vein harvest included aortofemoral reconstruction in 127 patients, brachiocephalic arterial reconstruction in 22 patients, and visceral arterial reconstruction in 13 patients.\nFasciotomy was performed in 47 of 264 limbs (17.8%) after deep vein harvest. The prevalence of fasciotomy after deep vein harvest was 20.6% for patients requiring aortofemoral reconstruction, whereas no patients underwent fasciotomy after deep vein harvest for mesenteric or brachiocephalic arterial reconstruction (P =.0068). Fasciotomy was performed in 20.7% of limbs after complete deep vein harvest to a level below the adductor hiatus, but no fasciotomies were performed in patients undergoing subtotal deep vein harvest, ending above the adductor hiatus (P =.0023). The mean preoperative ankle-brachial index (ABI) was significantly lower in limbs requiring fasciotomy (ABI, 0.39 +/- 0.05), compared with patients who did not require fasciotomy (ABI, 0.79 +/- 0.02; P <.0001). Fasciotomy was performed in 76.0% of limbs undergoing concurrent ipsilateral greater saphenous vein (GSV) and deep vein harvest, compared with 11.7% of patients undergoing deep vein harvest alone (P <.0001). The mean volume of intraoperative fluid administered to patients requiring fasciotomy was almost 50% higher than the fluid resuscitation received by patients who did not require fasciotomy (9.6 +/- 1.2 L vs 6.5 +/- 0.6 L; P <.0001). Logistic regression analysis determined that lower preoperative ABI (odds ratio [OR], 60.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.5-289.3; P <.0001) and concurrent harvest of the ipsilateral GSV (OR, 9.9; 95% CI, 3.1-31.3; P <.0001) were predictors of the need for fasciotomy.\nOne in four patients undergoing deep vein harvest for aortofemoral reconstruction may be expected to develop acute compartment syndrome and require fasciotomy. The risk appears to be greatest in patients with severe lower extremity ischemia and in patients undergoing simultaneous GSV and deep vein harvest. Prophylactic fasciotomy may be appropriate in patients with both risk factors, but vigilance for the development of compartment syndrome after deep vein harvest is required in all patients undergoing deep vein harvest for aortofemoral reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Differences in the reporting methods of results for arteriovenous (AV) access can dramatically affect apparent outcome. To enable meaningful comparisons in the literature, the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Association for Vascular Surgery (SVS/AAVS) recently published reporting standards for dialysis access. The purpose of the present study was to determine infection rates, patency rates, and possible predictive factors for prosthetic thigh AV access outcomes with the reporting standards of the SVS/AAVS.\nA retrospective analysis was performed of all patients who underwent placement of thigh AV access by the Surgical Teaching Service at Greenville Memorial Hospital between 1989 and 2001. Outcomes were determined based on SVS/AAVS Standards for Reports Dealing with AV Accesses. The rate of revision per year of access patency was also determined; this end point more accurately reflects the true cost and morbidity associated with AV access than do patency or infection rates alone.\nOne hundred twenty-five polytetrafluoroethylene thigh AV accesses were placed in 100 patients. Nine accesses were excluded from the study, six because there was no patient follow-up and 3 as a result of deaths unrelated to the access procedure and which occurred less than 30 days after access placement. There were six (4%) late access-related deaths. There were 18 (15%) early access failures, related to infection in 14 cases (12%), thrombosis in three cases (2%), and steal in one case (1%). Early failure was more common in patients with diabetes mellitus (P =.036). The primary and secondary functional patency rates were 19% and 54%, respectively, at 2 years. Infection occurred in 48 (41%) accesses. The patency and infection rates were not influenced by patient age, gender, body mass index, or diabetes mellitus. The median number of interventions per year of access patency was 1.68, and this outcome was positively correlated with body mass index (P <.001).\nProsthetic AV access in the thigh is associated with higher morbidity compared with that reported for the upper extremity, and should be considered only if no upper extremity AV access option is available. Early access failure and the requirement for an increased number of interventions to reestablish and maintain access patency are more common in patients with diabetes mellitus and obesity. The number of interventions per year of access patency is a valuable end point when assessing the outcome of AV access procedures.",

In addition to review of the index hospital stay, hospital admissions within 30 days of the procedure were reviewed and the Medicare enrollment database queried to identify out-of-hospital deaths, to determine 30-day outcome results.

There was a significant decrease in the combined event rate (30-day stroke or mortality) for CEA alone procedures between baseline and remeasurement (B, 5.6%; R, 5.0%). A decrease occurred in each of the indication strata; transient ischemic attack or stroke (B, 7.7%; R, 6.9%), nonspecific symptoms (B, 5.9%; R, 5.4%), and no symptoms (B, 4.1%; R, 3.8%). The combined event rate also decreased for CEA and CABG (B, 17.4%; R, 13.3%) and repeat CEA operations (B, 6.8%; R, 5.7%). The remeasurement period state-to-state variation in combined event rate for CEA alone ranged from 2.7% (Georgia) to 5.9% (Indiana) for all indications combined, from 4.4% (Georgia) to 10.9% (Michigan) in patients with recent transient ischemia or stroke, from 1.4% (Georgia) to 6.0% (Oklahoma) in patients with no symptoms, and from 3.7% (Georgia) to 7.9% (Indiana) in patients with nonspecific symptoms. There were significant increases in preoperative antiplatelet administration (62%-67%; P <.0001) and patching (29%-45%; P =.05) from baseline to remeasurement in the CEA alone subset. Preoperative antiplatelet administration and patching were associated with improved outcomes in the combined baseline and remeasurement data.\nCommunity-wide quality improvement initiatives with performance measurement and confidential reporting of provider level data can lead to improvement in important care processes and outcomes. There is considerable variation between states in outcome and process, and thus continued room for improvement. Quality improvement projects that include standardized confidential outcome reporting should be encouraged. Preoperative antiplatelet therapy administration and patching rates should be considered as evidence-based performance measures.",

    "abstract": "Established American Heart Association guidelines recommend the use of statin drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and antiplatelet agents in patients with systemic atherosclerosis, such as those undergoing operative intervention to treat peripheral atherosclerotic disease. Many of these patients have not received treatment of coronary heart disease and have not been prescribed these medications. Whether statin drugs and ACE inhibitors confer an improvement in graft patency, limb salvage, and operative mortality is unknown.\nConsecutive patients who underwent infrainguinal bypass between 1997 and 2002 were evaluated for demographic data, comorbid disease, medication use, as well as cumulative graft patency, limb salvage, and mortality. Univariate, multivariate logistical regression, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed. P <.05 was considered significant.\nTwo hundred ninety-three patients (mean age, 64 years; 67% men) underwent 338 infrainguinal bypass procedures with autologous vein (n = 218), prosthetic grafts (n = 88), or composite prosthetic-vein grafts (n = 32). Limb salvage was the operative indication in 75% of procedures. Coexisting diseases included hypertension (70%), diabetes (52%), hyperlipidemia (37%), coronary heart disease (51%), congestive heart failure (14%), and active tobacco use (30%). Statin drugs were taken by 56% of patients, ACE inhibitors by 54% of patients, and antiplatelet agents or warfarin sodium (Coumadin) by 93% of patients. Postoperative graft surveillance was done in 39% of patients. Cumulative graft patency was 73%, limb salvage was 85%, and mortality was 9%, with a mean follow-up of 17 months. Factors independently associated with increased graft patency included statin drug use (odds ratio [OR], 3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-6.4), male sex (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.6-5.0), and graft surveillance (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.5). Factors associated with decreased amputation rate were statin drug use (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 6.15-0.77) and graft surveillance (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 6.1-0.63). Factors associated with decreased mortality included graft surveillance (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.1-0.56), whereas congestive heart failure (OR, 6.5; 95% CI, 2.5-17) and hemodialysis-dependent renal failure (OR, 29; 95% CI, 6.1-140) were associated with increased mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that only ACE inhibitors were associated with lower mortality (P =.05)\nPatients undergoing infrainguinal bypass are undertreated with respect to cardioprotective medications. ACE inhibitor use is associated with lower mortality, and statin drug use is associated with improved graft patency and limb salvage. Institution of consensus guidelines concerning these medications should be considered by all vascular specialists, including vascular surgeons.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is prevalent in first-degree relatives of young adults with premature-onset peripheral arterial occlusive disease (premature PAD), but it is not known whether the genetic influence is independent of other risk factors, the most prevalent of which is smoking. This study was performed to determine the relative contributions of family history and smoking to the development of occult PAD in siblings of patients with premature PAD.\nThe prevalence of occult PAD was determined with carotid, abdominal, and lower extremity duplex ultrasound scanning in 50 asymptomatic siblings (25 men, 25 women) of patients with premature PAD (onset <or=49 years). Thirty of the siblings (60%) were active smokers, and 20 had never smoked. Age-matched and sex-matched reference groups included 50 asymptomatic heavy smokers (>20 cigarettes/day) and 50 nonsmokers.\nDuplex ultrasound scans demonstrated raised arterial lesions in 20 asymptomatic siblings (40%), 20 heavy smokers (40%), and 2 nonsmoking control subjects (4%), resulting in 42 affected and 108 unaffected subjects. As expected, smokers were far more likely to have arterial lesions than were nonsmokers (odds ratio [OR], 11.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1-30.7; P <.0001). Individuals with a family history of premature PAD were almost three times more likely to have arterial lesions than those with no family history of cardiovascular disease (OR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.3-5.8; P =.006). Stratified and multivariable logistic regression indicated no interaction between smoking and family history, indicating simple additive effects on PAD.\nFamily history is a major determinant of occult PAD in young adults, and is at least as important as standard atherosclerotic risk factors. A high proportion of heavy smokers have clearly detectable lesions even though asymptomatic. Smoking and family history act additively to increase the risk for premature PAD.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular therapy for moderate femoropopliteal arterial occlusive disease remains controversial. This study reviewed our experience with endovascular therapy for TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus (TASC) type B disease, which is defined as multiple stenoses less than 3 cm in diameter or a single stenosis or occlusion 3 to 5 cm in diameter. Stenosis-free patency was used as an objective end point to evaluate the hemodynamic outcome.\nA retrospective review was performed of all patients who had undergone endovascular treatment of TASC type B lesions between 1997 and 2002 at two referral centers. Balloon angioplasty was performed in all patients. Stenting was used selectively as an adjunct in patients with suboptimal angioplasty results. The treated sites were examined with duplex ultrasound scanning at 6-month to 12-month intervals. Stenosis-free patency was defined as the absence of stenosis greater than 50% diameter in the treated arterial segment with standard duplex criteria.\nOne hundred fifteen limbs in 98 patients were studied. The indication for treatment was claudication in 92 patients (80%) and ischemic rest pain or gangrene in the remaining patients (20%). Multiple lesions greater than 3 cm were treated in 89 limbs (77%), and a single lesion 3 to 5 cm long was treated in 26 limbs (23%). Balloon angioplasty alone was performed in 74 limbs (65%), and angioplasty and adjunctive stenting was performed in 41 limbs (35%). Endovascular therapy was technically successful in all but one patient (99%), and there was no perioperative mortality or limb loss. During follow-up recurrent stenosis was detected in 46 limbs (40%), and reocclusion occurred in 11 limbs (10%). Seven patients (6%) underwent surgical bypass after endovascular treatment failure. The aggregate 1-year stenosis-free patency rate at life table analysis was 55.1%. The 1-year stenosis-free patency for angioplasty alone was 58%, compared with 51% (NS) for angioplasty and adjunctive stenting. Univariate regression analysis failed to demonstrate a difference in stenosis-free patency for demographic variables, medical comorbidities, and anatomic characteristics (multiple vs single lesions; number of angioplasty procedures).\nEndovascular therapy for TASC type B femoropopliteal lesions is safe and technically feasible. However, the length of time that a treated arterial segment remains free of stenosis is limited, and is not improved with adjunctive stenting. Recurrent stenosis, not occlusion, was the most common study end point, and few patients subsequently required surgical bypass. Predictors of outcome after endovascular therapy for TASC type B lesions were not identified in this study.",

Multiple lesions greater than 3 cm were treated in 89 limbs (77%), and a single lesion 3 to 5 cm long was treated in 26 limbs (23%). Balloon angioplasty alone was performed in 74 limbs (65%), and angioplasty and adjunctive stenting was performed in 41 limbs (35%). Endovascular therapy was technically successful in all but one patient (99%), and there was no perioperative mortality or limb loss. During follow-up recurrent stenosis was detected in 46 limbs (40%), and reocclusion occurred in 11 limbs (10%). Seven patients (6%) underwent surgical bypass after endovascular treatment failure. The aggregate 1-year stenosis-free patency rate at life table analysis was 55.1%. The 1-year stenosis-free patency for angioplasty alone was 58%, compared with 51% (NS) for angioplasty and adjunctive stenting. Univariate regression analysis failed to demonstrate a difference in stenosis-free patency for demographic variables, medical comorbidities, and anatomic characteristics (multiple vs single lesions; number of angioplasty procedures).",

This study was performed to determine the effect of placement of an AIB proximal anastomotic site in a patient with ipsilateral PI.\nPatients undergoing AIB and PI between January 1990 and July 2002 were included in the study. They were classified into two groups on the basis of location of the proximal anastomosis. In group 1 the AIB proximal anastomosis was placed on the PI in the groin, whereas in group 2 the AIB proximal anastomosis was placed on a distal native groin artery. Patency, limb salvage, and patient survival in the two groups were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine independent risk factors affecting AIB patency.\nTwo hundred twenty-nine patients underwent AIB and PI. In group 1, 23 AIBs became thrombosed concurrent with 26 PI occlusions, and in group 2, 7 AIBs became thrombosed concurrent with 36 PI occlusions (P <.001). Five-year assisted primary patency, limb salvage, and patient survival in groups 1 and 2 were 50% and 75% (P <.001, log-rank test), 78% and 90% (P =.005, log-rank test), and 56% and 69% (P = NS, log-rank test), respectively. Factors independently associated with AIB occlusion are hypertension (hazard ratio [HR], 3.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-7.05; P =.001), postoperative warfarin sodium therapy (HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.07-3.23; P =.03), continued smoking (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.93-3.18; P =.08), AIB arising from PI (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.35-4.18; P =.003), and PI occlusion (HR, 3.70; 95% CI, 2.15-6.36; P <.001).\nA proximal AIB anastomosis located directly on the PI is an independent risk factor for decreased AIB patency of equal or greater importance than current smoking, hypertension, or PI occlusion.

    "abstract": "Graft patency, limb salvage, and mortality are the traditional means of assessing the outcome of infrainguinal bypass surgery (IBS). However, these measures underestimate patient morbidity and fail to consider the entire spectrum of treatment required to restore the patients to their premorbid state. The aim of this study was to quantify the efforts required to achieve limb salvage by assessing three nontraditional outcomes: (1). index limb reoperation rate in 3 months, (2). hospital readmission rate in the first 6 months after IBS, and (3). wound-healing time.\nWe retrospectively analyzed 318 IBSs performed at a single institution. Repeat operations for limb or graft-related problems and readmissions within 6 months of the initial operation were recorded. When available, wound-healing time was determined. Pertinent demographics and comorbidities were subjected to univariate and multivariate analysis to determine risk factors for adverse outcomes.\nSeventy-two percent of patients underwent IBS for critical limb ischemia (CLI), and 84% had below-knee popliteal or distal bypasses. Among those who underwent IBS for CLI, 48.9% of patients required at least one reoperation within 3 months. Within 6 months, 49.3% of patients required hospital readmission. Time to heal exceeded 3 months in 54% of patients. After multivariate analysis, tissue loss and minority status were significant risk factors for reoperation within 3 months. Tissue loss and renal failure increased the odds for readmission within 6 months. Diabetes was the sole risk factor for prolonged wound healing.\nIBS for limb salvage is often complicated by prolonged recovery and multiple reoperations and readmissions. Traditional reporting standards for limb salvage operations need modification to reflect the true outcome of such procedures.",

    "abstract": "Clinical and anatomic factors predictive of a favorable response to renal revascularization performed for renal function salvage remain poorly defined. To clarify decision making in such patients we reviewed a contemporary experience of surgical renal artery revascularization (RAR) performed primarily for preservation of renal function.\nBetween June 1990 and March 2001 (ensuring 1 year minimum follow-up), 96 patients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine [Cr] concentration >or=1.5 mg/dL) and hypertension underwent RAR for preservation of renal function. Study end points included early and late renal function response, progression to dialysis dependence, and long-term survival. Variables potentially associated with these end points were assessed with univariate analysis, Cox regression analysis, and logistic regression analysis, and survival was assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method.\nPerioperative failure of RAR occurred in 3 patients (3%), with perioperative mortality in 4 patients (4.1%); thus 92 patients were available for long-term follow-up (mean, 39 months). Mean patient age was 70 +/- 9 years with a mean baseline Cr of 2.6 mg/dL (range, 1.5-7.8 mg/dL). Operative management consisted of aortorenal bypass in 38% of patients, extraanatomic bypass in 38% of patients, and endarterectomy in 24% of patients; 32% of patients required combined aortic revascularization and RAR, and 27% underwent bilateral RAR. At hospital discharge renal function had improved (20% decrement in Cr) in 41 (43%) patients, including 7 patients who were removed from dialysis; remained unchanged in 40 (41%) patients; and declined (20% increase in Cr) in 15 (16%) patients. At last follow-up renal function was either improved or unchanged in 72% of patients. Predictors of a favorable response to RAR at last follow-up included stable Cr at hospital discharge (odds ratio [OR], 7.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-21.8; P =.0004) and decreased Cr at hospital discharge (OR, 16; 95% CI, 1.6-307.8; P <.0001); bilateral renal artery repair (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 0.9-10.6; P =.07) approached clinical significance. Predictors of worsened excretory function at last follow-up included decline of renal function at hospital discharge (OR, 28.9; 95% CI, 5.0-165.4; P =.0002), intervention to treat unilateral renal artery stenosis (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 0.8-16.6; P =.05), and level of baseline Cr (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.0-4.0; P =.04). Progression to dialysis occurred in 16 (17%) patients. Dialysis-free survival at 5 years was 50%, and overall actuarial survival at 5 years was 59%. Predictors of progression to dialysis during follow-up included treatment of complete renal artery occlusion (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 1.3-29.5; P =.02), early failure of RAR (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 0.7-14.2; P =.04) and baseline Cr (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3-6.1; P =.006).\nLong-term clinical success in the preservation of renal function, noted in 70% of patients, can be predicted by the initial response to RAR and by anatomic factors, in particular, bilateral repair. While extreme (mean Cr >or=3.2 mg/dL) renal dysfunction generally is predictive of poor long-term outcome, a subset of patients will experience favorable results, even to the extent of rescue from dialysis. These results may facilitate clinical decision making in the application of RAR for renal function salvage.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that detection of the location of the major artery supplying the spinal cord, that is, the artery of Adamkiewicz or the great radicular artery (GRA), with angiography would help prevent paraplegia. Knowing which intercostal artery provides this important branch would enable prompt, focused revascularization.\nThe surgical outcome in 131 patients with Crawford extent 1 and 2 degenerative aneurysms and 69 patients with descending thoracic aortic dissection was correlated with findings on selective intercostal arteriograms. Angiographic maneuvers were done with care, and the procedures were aborted if there was loose or \"shaggy\" mural thrombus, significant tortuosity, or difficulty entering each dissection channel. No attempts were made to find major contributions proximal to T6. Subarachnoid drains were placed in all patients, and all but five patients underwent distal aortic perfusion with controlled cooling to 32 degrees F. Five patients underwent cold circulatory arrest, enabling replacement of the distal aortic arch. We defined paraplegia simply as the inability to walk at hospital discharge, paraparesis as impaired ambulation, and both as having spinal cord dysfunction (SCD).\nA GRA was found in 65 (43%)of the 151 patients studied. Of the 65 patients with the GRA identified, SCD developed in 3 (4.6%) patients. Thirteen of 135 (9.6%) patients in whom the GRA was not identified, either because they were not studied or were studied and the GRA was not found, developed SCD (P =.35) However, when the GRA was identified, SCD occurred only in the group with aortic dissection. None of the 45 patients with degenerative aneurysms with the GRA identified had SCD, compared with 9 of 55 (16%) patients studied but without a GRA found (P =.01).\nThe approach with selective intercostal angiography did not improve overall results. One third of our patients were not studied, and they fared as well as patients who were studied and the GRA was localized (not studied, 4 of 49, 8% with SCD; GRA localized, 3 of 65, 5% with SCD; P =.8). However, when the GRA was found, SCD occurred only in patients with aortic dissection. The studies confirmed the concept that the existence of mural thrombus in degenerative aneurysms results in the occlusion of many intercostal arteries, leaving those remaining patent to supply rich vascular watersheds through acquired collateral channels. As a result, in the group of patients with degenerative aneurysms, the identification of the critical intercostal artery allows focused reimplantation with uniform success. This is not the case in patients with aortic dissection. In those patients, most intercostal vessels remain patent, such that the insertion of one pair is insufficient to supply the paravertebral plexus and the spinal cord. Finally, failure to identify the GRA angiographically with our methods does not provide assurance that the GRA does not exist. Therefore negative findings did not provide license to ligate all intercostal arteries.",

    "abstract": "The conservative versus therapeutic approach to type II endoleak after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR) has been controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and cost-effectiveness of the conservative approach of embolizing type II endoleak only when persistent for more than 6 months and associated with aneurysm sac growth of 5 mm or more.\nData for 486 consecutive patients who underwent EVAR were analyzed for incidence and outcome of type II endoleaks. Spiral computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed, and patient outcome was evaluated at either office visit or telephone contact. Patients with new or late-appearing type II endoleak were evaluated with spiral CT at 6-month intervals to evaluate both persistence of the endoleak and size of the aneurysm sac. Persistent (>or=6 months) type II endoleak and aneurysm sac growth of 5 mm or greater were treated with either translumbar glue or coil embolization of the lumbar source, or transarterial coil embolization of the inferior mesenteric artery.\nType II endoleaks were detected in 90 (18.5%) patients. With a mean follow-up of 21.7 +/- 16 months, only 35 (7.2%) patients had type II endoleak that persisted for 6 months or longer. Aneurysm sac enlargement was noted in 5 patients, representing 1% of the total series. All 5 patients underwent successful translumbar sac embolization (n = 4) or transarterial inferior mesenteric artery embolization (n = 4) at a mean follow-up of 18.2 +/- 8.0 months, with no recurrence or aneurysm sac growth. No patient with treated or untreated type II endoleak has had rupture of the aneurysm. The mean global cost for treatment of persistent type II endoleak associated with aneurysm sac growth was US dollars 6695.50 (hospital cost plus physician reimbursement). Treatment in the 30 patients with persistent type II endoleak but no aneurysm sac growth would have represented an additional cost of US dollars 200000 or more. The presence or absence of a type II endoleak did not affect survival (78% vs 73%) at 48 months.\nSelective intervention to treat type II endoleak that persists for 6 months and is associated with aneurysm enlargement seems to be both safe and cost-effective. Longer follow-up will determine whether this conservative approach to management of type II endoleak is the standard of care.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the distribution of secondary interventions after aortic stent grafting (EVAR) performed to treat infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and evaluated clinical success and survival in patients who underwent a secondary procedure (group 2) compared with patients who did not undergo a secondary procedure (group 1).\nTwo hundred fifty patients (mean age, 71.3 years) with asymptomatic AAAs (mean aneurysm diameter, 54.5 mm) underwent treatment with commercially available stent grafts. Mean follow-up was 28 months (median, 25 months). Secondary procedures were defined as any additional procedures performed after initial graft placement to treat endoleak, migration, kinking, stenosis, or occlusion. Overall clinical success was defined according to reporting standards of the Society for Vascular Surgery/American Association for Vascular Surgery.\nSixty-eight patients (27%) required 112 secondary procedures, with a mean time from initial graft placement of 18.2 months. Patients who received grafts since removed from the market required more secondary procedures (59%, procedure:patient ratio) compared with patients who received devices still on the market (21%; P =.001). Thirty-six patients (53%) required a single secondary procedure, 24 patients (35%) required two procedures, 5 patients (10%) required three procedures, 2 patients (3%) required four procedures, and 1 patient required five secondary procedures. Ninety-eight procedures (87%) were performed with endovascular methods, including placement of 42 additional covered stent grafts (36 iliac, 6 aortic), with a success rate of 85%; 35 embolization procedures (21 lumbar, 9 internal iliac artery, 5 mesenteric), with only 23 (65%) successful; 14 angioplasty procedures, with 85% successful; 4 thrombolysis procedures, 2 of them successful (50%); and 3 successfully placed new endografts within a previous endovascular graft. Surgical secondary operations included nine femorofemoral bypass procedures and three femoral thromboendarterectomies, all of which remain patent; one cerclage of an external iliac limb; and one laparoscopic repair of a type II endoleak, which was successful. Overall clinical success rate for EVAR was 84% (211 of 250) in this series. Clinical success rate in groups 1 and 2 was 91% (166 of 182) versus 66% (45 of 68; P =.001) if all endoleaks on the most recent computed tomography scans are taken into account, and 94% (171 of 182) versus 76% (52 of 68; P =.001) if type II endoleak without aneurysm growth is not considered failure. The survival rate and rupture-free survival in groups 1 and 2 were, respectively, 97.7% +/- 1.0% and 98.5% +/- 1.4% at 1 month, 95.9% +/- 1.5% and 96.9% +/- 2.1% at 6 months, 94.4% +/- 2.0% and 93.2% +/- 3.4% at 1 year, and 80.8% +/- 5.2% and 88.5% +/- 5.0% at 3 years (P =.273, log-rank test).\nWith close follow-up and a significant number of secondary operations, this 8-year experience has not included any aneurysm ruptures to date. Secondary operations did not lead to increased mortality, but were associated with more surgical conversions and with a higher clinical failure rate.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine the effect of the preoperative diameter of abdominal aortic aneurysms on the midterm outcome after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nThe data for 4392 patients who had undergone EVAR were analyzed. Patients were enrolled over 6 years to June 2002 in the EUROSTAR database. Outcomes were compared between three groups defined by the preoperative diameter of the aneurysm: group A (n = 1962), 4.0 to 5.4 cm; group B (n = 1528), 5.5 to 6.4 cm; and group C (n = 902), 6.5 cm or larger. Patient characteristics, details of aortoiliac anatomy, operative procedures, old or current device generation, and postoperative complications in the three patient groups were compared. Outcome events included aneurysm-related death, unrelated death, conversion, and post-EVAR rupture of the aneurysm. Life table analysis and log-rank tests were used to compare outcome in the three study groups. Multivariate Cox models were used to determine whether baseline and follow-up variables were independently associated with adverse outcome events.\nPatients in group C were significantly older than patients in groups A and B (73 years vs 70 and 72 years, respectively; P =.003 - P <.0001 for different group comparisons), and more frequently were at higher operative risk (American Society of Anesthesiologists classification >or=3; 63% vs 48% and 54%; P =.0002-P <.0001). Device-related (type I) endoleaks were more frequently observed at early postoperative arteriography in group C compared with groups A and B (9.9% vs 3.7% and 6.8%; P =.01-P <.0001). Postoperatively systemic complications were more frequently present in group C (17.4% vs 12.0% in group A and 12.6% in group B; P <.0001 and.001). The first-month mortality was approximately twice as high in group C compared with the other groups combined (4.1% vs 2.1%; P <.0001). Late rupture was most frequent in group C. Follow-up results at midterm were less favorable in groups C and B compared with group A (freedom from rupture, 90%, 98%, and 98% at 4 years in groups C, B, and A, respectively; P <.0001 for group C vs groups A and B). Aneurysm-related death was highest in group C (88% freedom at 4 years, compared with 95% in group B and 97% in A; P =.001 and P <.0001, respectively; group B vs A, P =.004). The annual rate of aneurysm-related death in group C was 1% in the first 3 years, but accelerated to 8.0% in the fourth year. Incidence of unrelated death also was higher in groups C and B than in group A (76% and 82% freedom at 4 years vs 87%; P <.0001 for both comparisons). Ratio of aneurysm-related to unrelated death was 23%, 21%, and 50% in groups A, B, and C, respectively. Cox models demonstrated that the correlation between large aneurysms (group C) and all assessed outcome events was independent and highly significant. Older generation devices had an independent association with aneurysm-related and unrelated deaths (P =.02 and P =.04, respectively). However, this correlation was less strong than large aneurysm diameter (P =.0001 and P =.0009, respectively).\nThe midterm outcome of large aneurysms after EVAR was associated with increased rates of aneurysm-related death, unrelated death, and rupture. Reports of EVAR should stratify their outcomes according to the diameter of the aneurysm. Large aneurysms need a more rigorous post-EVAR surveillance schedule than do smaller aneurysms. In small aneurysms EVAR was associated with excellent outcome. This finding may justify reappraisal of currently accepted management strategies.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the technical feasibility and short-term results of juxtarenal aneurysm repair with an endovascular graft that incorporated the visceral aortic segment with graft material.\nPatients were studied prospectively after the implantation of an endovascular device with graft material extending proximal to the renal arteries, variably incorporating the superior mesenteric and celiac arteries. All patients were deemed to be high risk with respect to open surgical repair and had compromised proximal neck anatomy. Proximal neck lengths were <or=10 mm, or <or=15 mm with a challenging morphology (funnel shape or extensive thrombus). Fenestrations within the graft material were customized to accommodate visceral and renal vessels on the basis of computerized tomography (CT), angiography, or intravascular ultrasound data. Selected visceral ostia were protected with balloon-expandable stents after partial endograft deployment. All patients were evaluated with CT and kidney, ureters, and bladder x-ray at discharge and at 1, 6, and 12 months. Visceral duplex scan studies were performed at 1, 6, and 12 months.\nA total of 22 patients were enrolled in the study. Sixteen patients had short proximal necks (3-10 mm), and six had compromised necks of 10 to 15 mm in length. Endograft design included bifurcated (20) and tube (2) systems. All prostheses were implanted successfully without the acute loss of any visceral arteries. A total of 58 visceral vessels were incorporated (mean, 2.6 per patient) and most commonly included both renal arteries and the superior mesenteric artery. The mean follow-up was 6 months. There were no deaths within 30 days and no aneurysm-related deaths during the follow-up period. Two early (<30 days) and two late secondary interventions were performed, inclusive of two visceral artery stenoses detected with duplex scanning. The 30-day endoleak rate was 4.5%. The aneurysm sac decreased greater than 5 mm in 53 % of patients at 6 months and three of four patients at 12 months. Three patients developed renal insufficiency, only one of which required temporary hemodialysis.\nThe placement of an endovascular prosthesis with graft material that incorporates the visceral arteries is technically feasible. The occurrence of endoleaks appears to be relatively low. The increased sealing and fixation zones in this patient population should limit the late development of proximal endoleak or migration; however, this situation will require more patients and extended follow-up.",

Endograft design included bifurcated (20) and tube (2) systems. All prostheses were implanted successfully without the acute loss of any visceral arteries. A total of 58 visceral vessels were incorporated (mean, 2.6 per patient) and most commonly included both renal arteries and the superior mesenteric artery. The mean follow-up was 6 months. There were no deaths within 30 days and no aneurysm-related deaths during the follow-up period. Two early (<30 days) and two late secondary interventions were performed, inclusive of two visceral artery stenoses detected with duplex scanning. The 30-day endoleak rate was 4.5%. The aneurysm sac decreased greater than 5 mm in 53 % of patients at 6 months and three of four patients at 12 months. Three patients developed renal insufficiency, only one of which required temporary hemodialysis.",

In this report, we discuss the case of a 54 year-old woman with an unusual aneurysm of the right subclavian artery in association with congenital absence of the right internal carotid artery. The aneurysm was successfully surgically repaired. On the basis of the appearance of the aneurysm and the absence of known atherosclerotic risk factors in this patient, it is hypothesized that the aneurysm is, in fact, congenital and related to anomalous development of the embryonic aortic arch branches.",

    "abstract": "During endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, aneurysmal involvement of the common or internal iliac arteries occasionally necessitates elective occlusion of one or both internal iliac arteries. Although elective internal iliac artery occlusion is often well tolerated, it can result in complications such as buttock claudication or rest pain, impotence, and colon ischemia. We report a case of gluteal compartment syndrome following elective unilateral internal iliac artery embolization prior to endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. On the first postoperative day, the patient developed sciatic nerve palsy, rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure, which promptly resolved after emergent operative exploration of his left buttock and debridement of all grossly necrotic muscle. This case emphasizes the point that, although elective internal iliac artery interruption is usually benign, it can have serious and unexpected complications that necessitate expeditious treatment for complete recovery.",

    "abstract": "The effect of AT-1015, a serotonin(2A) receptor antagonist, on the resaturation of ischemic muscle in a hypercholesterolemic rabbit model was examined with near-infrared spectroscopy.\nNew Zealand White male rabbits were fed normal chow or cholesterol-rich chow. Ischemia was induced in the right hindlimb by ligation of the femoral artery, accompanied by balloon injury of the iliac artery. At 3 days after induction of ischemia, the bilateral gastrocnemius muscles were subjected to passive contraction for 2 minutes. The oxygen resaturation time of the gastrocnemius muscle after exercise was measured by near-infrared spectroscopy. AT-1015 was orally administered for 3 days after induction of ischemia. Assay of serotonin level in platelet-poor plasma and histologic examination of muscle and artery were performed in another set of rabbits.\nOxygen resaturation time of the ischemic gastrocnemius was significantly prolonged in hypercholesterolemic rabbits compared with in normal rabbits without AT-1015, whereas there was no difference between both groups of rabbits that were administered AT-1015. Plasma level of serotonin in hypercholesterolemic rabbits was significantly increased compared with that in normal rabbits. No histologic differences were found in both muscle and artery among all groups.\nA serotonin(2A) receptor antagonist improved the oxygen resaturation of ischemic calf muscle after exercise in hypercholesterolemia. The interaction between plasma free serotonin and the serotonin(2A) receptor may play an important role in muscle oxygenation in ischemic limbs.",

    "abstract": "Adult endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) may be a useful source for engineering the endothelialization of vascular grafts. However, the optimal factors that promote differentiation of EPCs into endothelium remain to be elucidated. The goal of this current report was to determine which extracellular matrix (ECM) protein might modulate or enhance the effects of EPCs on differentiation into mature endothelium.\nHuman EPCs (CD34(+) cells) were cultured in ECM-coated six-well plates in MCDB-131 medium containing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor-1, and basic fibroblast growth factor. After 21 days, differentiated endothelial colonies were confirmed by immunofluorescence for von Willebrand factor (vWF) and vascular-endothelial (VE)-cadherin and mRNA expression of the endothelial markers Flk-1, vWF, and VE-cadherin. Cell migration toward the VEGF-matrix protein combinations was also measured.\nAs judged by positive staining for endothelial markers vWF and VE-cadherin, the combination of VEGF with fibronectin (FN) produced significantly more endothelial colonies (P <.05) than did collagens I or IV or vitronectin. Defined fragments of FN did not enhance VEGF-mediated effects. Fibrinogen produced intermediate stimulation of differentiation. FN also enhanced VEGF-mediated CD34(+) cell migration. Blockade of alpha5beta1, but not alphavbeta3 or alphavbeta5, inhibited both VEGF-mediated CD34(+) cell differentiation and migration.\nVEGF and FN together significantly promote the migration and differentiation of CD34(+) cells. This synergism is specific to FN and the alpha5beta1 integrin. Combinations of VEGF and FN may be useful in promoting differentiation of circulating endothelial progenitors into endothelial cells for tissue engineering. Clinical relevance Treatment of injured or diseased tissues with adult stem cells is a promising approach. In particular, bone marrow derived circulating endothelial progenitors (CEP's) have been shown to differentiate into endothelial cells in vitro and promote tissue revascularization of ischemic limbs and myocardium in vivo. Because of the relative ease of obtaining CEP's and as well as its high proliferative rate, CEP's may have clinical potential for endothelialization of prosthetic vascular grafts and revascularization of injured myocardium. However, there is a need to better understand the molecular pathways involved in the proliferation and differentiation of CEP's to take full advantage of its clinical potential.",

    "abstract": "Autologous vein is the conduit of choice for small artery reconstruction. Despite excellent patency, these conduits undergo remodeling over time. The purpose of this study was to identify temporal gene expression in vein grafts versus control veins through microarray analysis.\nCephalic vein grafts (n = 12) were used to bypass femoral arteries in canines. Vein grafts were harvested after 1, 7, 14, and 30 days. Normal contralateral cephalic vein served as control. Total RNA was isolated; its quantity and quality were confirmed with spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis. Affymetrix U133A GeneChips, comprising approximately 15,000 genes, were used to analyze differential gene expression at each time point. Statistical analysis was performed with Affymetrix and dChip software to identify consistently upregulated and downregulated genes. Real-time, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry were used to validate microarray data.\nStatistical analysis revealed that 49 genes were consistently upregulated and 31 genes were consistently downregulated in all three animals at various time points. qRT-PCR to quantitatively assess messenger RNA expression was performed on specific genes to validate the microarray data. Immunohistochemistry to qualitatively assess protein expression was used for further validation. Hierarchical clustering with dChip identified additional genes with similar temporal or functional expression patterns.\nThis is the first study to use microarray analysis with confirmatory qRT-PCR to identify altered genes after vein bypass grafting. Oligonucleotide microarrays and hierarchical clustering are powerful tools to generate hypotheses as the basis for additional research on gene expression in vein graft remodeling. Ultimately, identification of a temporal sequence of differential gene expression may provide insights not preferred into the molecular mechanisms of vein graft remodeling, but also into the pathways leading to intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "G protein-linked receptors are involved in the processes that lead to intimal hyperplasia. This study examined the role of Galphaq signaling pathways in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in vitro.\nRat pulmonary artery SMCs were cultured in vitro. Standard assays of cellular DNA synthesis, proliferation, phospholipase C-beta (PLCbeta) activation, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation were used to study the response to angiotensin II (a specific Galphaq agonist; 0.1-100 micromol/L) in the presence and absence of GP-2A (a competitive Galphaq inhibitor; 10 micromol/L) and the PLCbeta inhibitor U73122 (10micromol/L).\nAngiotensin II induced SMC DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. DNA synthesis was inhibited by both Galphaq inhibitor, GP-2A, and PLCbeta inhibitor U73122, in a dose-dependent manner (66% +/- 7% of angiotensin II alone at 10 micromol/L for GP-2A [P <.05] and 63% +/- 6% for U73122). GP-2A completely inhibited angiotensin II-induced Galphaq-mediated PLCbeta phosphorylation. Activation of ERK1/2 by angiotensin II was significantly reduced by GP-2A (P <.05) and by PLCbeta inhibition (P <.05).\nInhibition of Galphaq decreases PLCbeta and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, leading to decreased SMC proliferation in vitro. Understanding specific signal transduction pathways will be an integral component of anti-restenosis therapy.Clinical Relevance The universal response of a blood vessel to injury is chronic wound healing, which includes the development of intimal hyperplasia and subsequent remodeling of the vessel wall. This can lead to luminal narrowing in as many as 30% of patients undergoing angioplasty. Neointimal formation is the principal cause of in-stent recurrent stenosis. Intimal hyperplasia is in part produced by smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation. Understanding the keys to the proliferation of SMCs will enable therapies to be developed that may inhibit the initial development of intimal hyperplasia. Whereas in the past many studies focused on the multiple mechanical, humoral, and cellular elements that induce SMC proliferation, molecular therapeutics focuses on key choke points within the cell that can be used to inhibit proliferation. One of these key choke points is signal transduction. Galphaq is one of the ubiquitous signal transduction proteins on the membrane of SMCs. Inhibiting G proteins, such as Galphaq, would enable interference with a significant amount of the mechanical, humeral, and cellular elements that produce SMC proliferation, and thus decrease the development of intimal hyperplasia. The present study identifies and begins to map out the role of Galphaq in SMC proliferation and investigates the possible use of a small peptide in its inhibition. Other data suggest that inhibition of other G proteins will also decrease intimal hyperplasia. This is therefore a fertile area for the development of therapeutics to inhibit intimal hyperplasia. The direct relevance to the clinician is that this study identifies a transduction pathway that may be inhibited, and points in the direction of a possible molecular therapeutic target that would be beneficial as an adjunct to angioplasty or as part of a drug-eluding stent regimen.",

    "abstract": "In our previous study, adenovirus-mediated ex vivo gene transfer of basic fibroblast growth factor promoted significant collateral vessel development in a rabbit model of hind limb ischemia. The present study examined how to control the efficacy and safety of this gene therapy, and also evaluated the feasibility of repeat application of this procedure.\nModified hFGF gene with the secretory signal sequence was adenovirally transferred to cultured autologous fibroblasts, and various numbers of the cells (2 x 10(5), 1 x 10(6), 5 x 10(6), or 2.5 x 10(7)) or vehicle was injected through the left internal iliac artery in rabbits in whom the left femoral artery had been excised 21 days previously. Twenty-eight days after cell administration, calf blood pressure ratio, angiographic score, blood flow in the internal iliac artery, and capillary density of muscle tissue were measured to analyze collateral vessel development and tissue perfusion in the ischemic limb. To assess delivery efficiency and viral contamination, the distribution of injected cells and the time course of blood anti-adenovirus antibody titer were examined in rabbits treated with various numbers of gene-transduced cells. In addition, animals received two injections, 21 days apart, of fibroblasts infected with adenovirus vector containing the luciferase gene, and luciferase expression was measured to evaluate whether the present therapy is repeatable.\nAt 28 days after cell administration, significant collateral vessel development without detectable side effects was observed in rabbits who received 5 x 10(6) or 2.5 x 10(7) cells, compared with those who received vehicle, and no significant development was detected in animals with fewer than 5 x 10(6) cells (P <.01 for calf blood pressure ratio and capillary density, P <.05 for angiographic score and maximum blood flow). There was no difference in collateral augmentation between rabbits with 5 x 10(6) and 2.5 x 10(7) cells. However, in animals with 2.5 x 10(7) cells a large number of injected cells accumulated in the lungs, anti-adenovirus antibody titer increased significantly, and calf blood pressure in the left hind limb of two rabbits decreased immediately after injection. Luciferase analysis showed very low gene expression after repeated administration.\nThese findings suggest that 5 x 10(6) is a suitable number of cells to induce appropriate collateral vessel development and minimize potential side effects of this procedure. Despite use of ex vivo gene transfer, repeat administration of the cells was not feasible. Clinical relevance Since the present study determined the appropriate conditions for effective and safe stimulation of collateral vessels, the clinical relevance of the ex vivo therapy might be carried forward. However, the findings raised another issue that should be resolved before clinical application; that is, the number of gene-transduced cells able to be injected was strictly limited. To estimate the therapeutic range of cell number in humans, additional experiments using large animals are desirable.",

Despite use of ex vivo gene transfer, repeat administration of the cells was not feasible. Clinical relevance Since the present study determined the appropriate conditions for effective and safe stimulation of collateral vessels, the clinical relevance of the ex vivo therapy might be carried forward. However, the findings raised another issue that should be resolved before clinical application; that is, the number of gene-transduced cells able to be injected was strictly limited. To estimate the therapeutic range of cell number in humans, additional experiments using large animals are desirable.",

    "abstract": "For patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI), there is a great need for alternative treatment strategies. One option is therapeutic angiogenesis by administration of vascular growth factors. The lack of convincing clinical data supporting this strategy may be due to the ignorance of endogenous angiogenic processes in CLI. To evaluate the importance of vascular growth factors in the pathogenesis in CLI and provide information for clinical growth factor treatment trials, we determined the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) in the ischemic legs of patients with this disease.\nSkin and muscle biopsies from the calf and groin were gathered from 25 patients with CLI. Control samples came from 10 orthopedic patients and from 5 patients who were undergoing coronary artery bypass. The concentration of VEGF and FGF-2 in the biopsies was measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay, and to localize growth factor production, biopsied sections were immunostained.\nPatients with CLI had lower levels of VEGF in distal skin samples than in proximal ones (mean difference: 16.7 pg/mg total protein, 95% confidence interval: -1.0 to -32.3, P =.038), but these levels were similar to those in distal samples from control subjects (8.0, -4.6 to 20.5, P =.65). In muscle, VEGF concentrations were similar in calf and groin (5.4, -12.4 to 23.1, P =.55), but distal levels were higher than in distal samples from control subjects (23.7, 1.2 to 56.7, P =.028). Skin FGF levels tended to be higher in distal samples (45.3, 26.5 to 117.5, P =.090) and were higher than in skin from control subjects (106.2, -11.4 to 223.8, P =.050). Also in muscle, distal samples had higher levels of FGF-2 (35.6, -1.6 to 59.7, P =.006), but these levels were similar to what was found in control subjects (29.4., -16.3 to 81.2, P =.39). Growth factors were located in connective tissue between muscle fibers. In skin, the predominant FGF-2 staining was just below the epidermal layer, whereas VEGF appeared in the dermal layer.\nThe results indicate that there are elevated concentrations of FGF-2 in calf muscle, whereas VEGF concentrations do not appear to be higher in the ischemic part of the leg in patients with CLI. These findings suggest that VEGF supplementation may be a more appropriate strategy for therapeutic angiogenesis to the calf area for CLI than FGF-2.",

    "abstract": "A tissue-engineered blood vessel (TEBV) produced in vitro by the self-assembly method was developed in our laboratory for the replacement of small-diameter blood vessels. The interior of this vessel is covered by an endothelium. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the endothelial layer would make a favorable contribution at the time of implantation of the TEBV by investigating in vitro the hemocompatible properties of the endothelial cells covering its interior.\nThe secretion of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) and expression of thrombomodulin by the endothelium were assessed, and the adhesive molecules E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were quantified as a function of maturation time. To evaluate the functional response of the endothelium on injury, the cellular response to physiological stimulatory factors (thrombin and lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) was analyzed.\nThe endothelial cells formed a confluent monolayer displaying favorable hemocompatible properties (78% +/- 10% of cells expressing thrombomodulin with only 12 +/- 3 mU/10(6) cells of vWF secreted over a 2-hour period), which acquired their full expression after a culture period of 4 days. Moreover, pro-adhesive properties toward inflammatory cells were not observed. The cells were also able to respond to physiological-stimulating agents (thrombin and LPS) and demonstrated a statistically significant overexpression of the corresponding molecules under the conditions tested.\nThese results indicate that the endothelium of the tissue-engineered blood vessel produced by the self-assembly approach displays advantageous qualities with regard to the vessel's future implantation as a small-diameter vascular prosthesis.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effects of sequential and prolonged exposure to high and low wall shear stress on arterial remodeling using a rabbit arteriovenous fistula (AVF) model. Blood flow was increased by approximately 17-fold to 20-fold when the AVF was open, and returned to normal when the AVF was occluded. Repeated opening and closing of the AVF resulted in sequential exposure of the artery to high and low wall shear stress. High flow and high wall shear stress induced arterial dilatation, elongation, and tortuosity, without intimal thickening. The common carotid artery was elongated 37% after 4 weeks of high flow, and was shortened 10% after 6 weeks of normal flow. Subsequent cycles of high flow induced less elongation, with less shortening after return to normal flow. Enlargement of the distal segment was more dramatic than in the proximal segment, despite exposure to the same volume of flow and the same initial high wall shear stress after creation of the AVF. The distal carotid segment enlarged more than did the proximal segment during each exposure to high flow. In segments of carotid artery exposed to low wall shear stress (<5 dynes/cm(2)) intimal thickening developed. These changes were maximal in the distal carotid segment, just before the AVF. Each cycle of low wall shear stress induced intimal thickening accompanied by medial hyperplasia. Intimal thickening was inhibited during periods of high flow when wall shear stress was high. Three cycles of flow alteration induced three layers of intimal thickening in the distal arterial segment, two layers of intimal thickening in the middle segment, and one layer of intimal thickening in the proximal segment. Long-term exposure to low wall shear stress induced severe intimal thickening and medial hyperplasia in different segments. Thus the response of the carotid artery afferent to an AVF varies along the length of the artery, with maximum enlargement, elongation, and tortuosity in the distal segment, just proximal to the AVF. Similarly, intimal thickening in response to low wall shear stress is maximal in the distal carotid artery. It appears that intimal thickening is related to local levels of low wall shear stress, and occurs when wall shear stress chronically falls to less than 5 dynes/cm(2).",

    "abstract": "Management of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains challenging because of their unpredictable behavior and high recurrence rate. A multidisciplinary approach based on a new classification scheme and improved diagnostic techniques may improve their management. The purpose of this study was to review our experience with combined embolotherapy, sclerotherapy (embolo/sclerotherapy), and surgical procedures to manage AVMs.\nA total of 797 patients with congenital vascular malformations (January 1995 through December 2001) was investigated with noninvasive studies. Once an AVM was diagnosed, all underwent angiographic confirmation as a roadmap for treatment. Embolo/sclerotherapy and surgical procedures were instituted by the multidisciplinary team with periodic follow-up per protocol. Seventy-six patients with AVMs were reviewed retrospectively to assess the diagnosis and management by a multidisciplinary approach.\nSeventy-six (9.5% of all CVM) patients had AVMs, mostly infiltrating, extratruncular form (61/76). Embolo/sclerotherapy with various combinations of absolute ethanol, N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA), contour particles, and coils were used in 48 patients. Sixteen patients with surgically accessible localized lesions completed preoperative embolism and sclerotherapy through 24 sessions, with subsequent surgical excision with minimal morbidity. Interim results were excellent, with no evidence of recurrence in all 16 patients with a mean follow-up of 24 months. Thirty-two patients with surgically inaccessible lesions (infiltrating) were treated with embolism and sclerotherapy alone. There were nine failures in a total of 171 sessions. Interim results with a mean of 19 months' follow-up of embolism and sclerotherapy alone were excellent in the majority (25/32) and good to fair among the rest (7/32). However, 31 complications, mostly minor (27/31), occurred in 30 sessions. Four major complications occurred, including facial nerve palsy, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and massive necrosis of an ear cartilage.\nDiagnosis and management of AVMs by a multidisciplinary approach that integrates surgical therapy with embolism and sclerotherapy appears to improve the results and management with limited morbidity and no recurrence during early follow-up.",

    "abstract": "In the United States more than 6 million persons have chronic venous insufficiency and more than 500,000 have venous ulcers. Patients in whom conservative therapies fail may improve after surgical treatment of superficial and perforating venous disease, but the degree of this benefit is uncertain.\nWe performed a systematic review of health outcomes in patients with severe chronic venous insufficiency treated with surgical management that incorporated subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS), to quantify the overall rates of surgical outcomes.\nPublished studies in English reporting venous ulcer healing and recurrence outcomes after SEPS were obtained from a MEDLINE search. Data regarding patient characteristics and surgical outcomes were abstracted from each study, and the outcomes were combined by using a random effects model.\nOur search identified 20 studies, 1 randomized trial and 19 case series, involving 1140 treated limbs. CEAP classification was secondary cause (E(S)) in 36%, deep venous involvement (A(D))in 56%, and obstructive (P(O)) in 12%. Overall, after surgical treatment including SEPS, with or without concomitant superficial venous ablation, ulcers in 88% of limbs healed. Ulcers recurred in 13%, at mean time of 21 months. Risk factors for nonhealing and recurrence included postoperative incompetent perforator veins, pathophysiologic obstruction, secondary cause, and ulcer diameter greater than 2 cm. Complications and their overall rates after surgical treatment including SEPS were wound infection (6%), hematoma (9%), neuralgia (7%), and deep venous thrombosis (1%).\nOur results suggest that surgical management of venous ulcer including SEPS, with or without saphenous ablation, leads to an 88% chance of ulcer healing and a 13% chance of ulcer recurrence over the short term. Randomized controlled trials are needed to discern the contributions of compression therapy, superficial venous surgery, and SEPS in the treatment of venous ulcer disease.",

Overall, after surgical treatment including SEPS, with or without concomitant superficial venous ablation, ulcers in 88% of limbs healed. Ulcers recurred in 13%, at mean time of 21 months. Risk factors for nonhealing and recurrence included postoperative incompetent perforator veins, pathophysiologic obstruction, secondary cause, and ulcer diameter greater than 2 cm. Complications and their overall rates after surgical treatment including SEPS were wound infection (6%), hematoma (9%), neuralgia (7%), and deep venous thrombosis (1%).",

    "abstract": "The increased use of central venous access primarily for hemodialysis has led to a significant increase in clinically relevant central venous occlusive disease (CVOD). The magnitude of and the optimal therapy for CVOD are not clearly established. The purpose of this study is to define the problem of CVOD and determine the success of percutaneous therapy for relieving symptoms and maintaining central venous patency.\nPatients presenting with disabling upper-extremity edema suggestive of central venous stenosis or occlusion during a 3-year period were evaluated by venography of the upper extremity and central veins. Percutaneous venous angioplasty (PTA) and/or stent placement was performed as clinically indicated. The success of therapy was assessed, and the patients were observed to determine the incidence of recurrence and additional procedures. Recurrent lesions underwent similar evaluation and treatment.\nA total of 32 sides were treated in 29 patients with a mean of 1.9 interventions per side treated. Hemodialysis-related lesions were the underlying cause in 87% with the remaining 13% related to previous central venous catheterization. The lesions involved the axillary, subclavian, and innominate veins with complete venous occlusion in six (19%) cases. Percutaneous angioplasty was followed by stent placement in six (19%) cases. The procedure was a technical success and was performed without complications in all cases (100%). Mean follow-up was 16.5 months (range, 4-36 months). On average, patient symptoms were controlled for 6.5 months after the initial intervention. Recurrent edema led to additional PTA in 20 (63%) cases. Fifty percent (n = 14) of patients with an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) experienced recurrent symptoms after initial and/or repeat PTA and required AVF ligation. Complete resolution after the initial PTA was predictive of long-term success.\nCentral venous occlusive disease has emerged as a significant clinical problem. Percutaneous venous angioplasty can provide temporary symptomatic relief; however, multiple procedures are often required and long-term relief is rarely achieved.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous intervention for symptomatic renal artery atherosclerosis is rapidly replacing surgery in many centers. This study evaluated the anatomic and functional outcomes of endovascular therapy for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis on a combined vascular surgery and interventional radiology service at an academic medical center.\nThis was a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent renal artery angioplasty with or without stenting between January 1990 and June 2002. Indications included hypertension (86%) and rising serum creatinine concentration (55%). One hundred forty-six patients (80 women; average age, 71 years [range, 44-89 years]) underwent 183 attempted interventions (64 to treat bilateral stenosis). Forty-five percent of patients had significant bilateral disease: 27% had greater than 50% bilateral stenosis, and the remainder had nonfunctioning, absent, or occluded vessels.\nOf 183 planned interventions, technical success (<30% residual stenosis) was achieved in 179 vessels (98%) with placement of 137 stents (75%). Thirty-day mortality was 0.7%. The major morbidity rate was 4%, and the procedure-related complication rate was 18%. Five-year cumulative patient mortality was 25%. Primary patency, assisted primary patency, and recurrent stenosis rates were 82% +/- 9%, 100% +/- 0%, and 30% +/- 7%, respectively, at 5 years. Within 3 months of the procedure, 52% of patients who received treatment of hypertension demonstrated clinical benefit (hypertension improved or cured), which was maintained in 68% of patients at 5 years. Serum creatinine concentration was lowered or stabilized in 87% of patients within 3 months of the procedure, but this benefit, including freedom from dialysis, was maintained in only 45% of patients at 5 years.\nEndovascular intervention for symptomatic atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is technically successful. There were excellent patency and low recurrent stenosis rates. There is immediate clinical benefit for most patients, but divergent long-term functional outcomes. Endovascular interventions modestly enhance the care of the patient with hypertension, but poorly preserve long-term renal function in the patient with chronic renal impairment.",

    "abstract": "Patients with intermittent claudication have a significantly increased risk of mortality from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular causes. Helicobacter pylori infection and abnormal platelet function have been shown to be associated with atherosclerosis as well as with acute ischemic events. The aim of this study was to assess for the first time the relation between H pylori serology status, platelet activation, and endothelial injury in patients with intermittent claudication. Design of study : A prospective observational study of 125 patients with intermittent claudication suitable for angioplasty was conducted at the Vascular Unit of the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. Main outcome measures Main outcome measures were (1) H pylori serology using ELISA kit for immunoglobulin G antibody to H pylori and (2) whole blood flow cytometric analysis of resting platelet P-selectin expression and fibrinogen binding as measures of platelet activation. Results are presented as platelet percentage. von Wildebrand factor levels were measured using ELISA as a marker of endothelial injury. Carstair deprivation scores were calculated for all patients.\nH pylori serology was positive in 62 patients (49.6%), negative in 56 (44.8%) and equivocal in 7 (5.6%). Median P-selectin expression was significantly increased in H pylori-positive patients compared with seronegative patients (0.815 vs 0.65; P =.039). Median platelet fibrinogen binding was higher in seropositive patients, but this failed to reach statistical significance (2.135 vs 1.85%; P =.11). There was no difference in von Wildebrand factor levels between the two groups (P =.51). There was no difference in socioeconomic status between the two groups.\nPatients with intermittent claudication who are H pylori positive show enhanced platelet activation that does not appear to be mediated by means of endothelial cell injury.",

    "abstract": "This preliminary study examined the technical efficacy, safety, and cost of treating arterial occlusions with a single device that combines pharmacologic and mechanical thrombolysis.\nThe technical success, bleeding complications, and costs for the first 26 consecutive patients in whom lower extremity ischemia was treated with the Trellis infusion catheter (TIC) were analyzed. Procedure time, thrombolytic infusion time, technical success, bleeding complications (major and intracranial hemorrhage), interventional suite time, and 30-day amputation-free survival were evaluated.\n15 of 26 patients (58%) who received treatment with the TIC had acute arterial occlusions, and 11 of 26 patients (42%) had nonacute arterial occlusions. Nineteen of 26 patients (73.1%) received treatment of an infrainguinal occlusion, and 7 of 26 patients (26.9%) received treatment of a suprainguinal occlusion. Lower extremity native arteries were treated in 18 of 26 patients (69%), and lower extremity bypass grafts in 8 of 26 patients (31%). The technical success rate with TIC treatment was 92%, and the 30-day amputation-free survival rate was 96%. There was no difference in technical success or amputation-free survival rate between acute versus nonacute arterial occlusions, native artery versus bypass grafts, and suprainguinal versus infrainguinal arterial occlusions. Procedure time was 2.1 +/- 0.9 hours, and infusion time was 0.3 +/- 0.2 hours. There were no bleeding complications; however, 3 of 26 patients (11.5%) required further intervention to treat distal embolization. The overall mean cost for patients with TIC treatment was $3216 +/- $1740.\nEarly results of TIC treatment in patients with arterial occlusions suggest that it is as effective as traditional catheter-directed thrombolysis. Furthermore, there were no bleeding complications, likely the result of TIC requiring shorter procedure and infusion times.",

    "abstract": "To quantitatively describe the temporal changes in elastic properties and wall dimensions in lower-extremity vein grafts after implantation.\nThis is a prospective study of patients (N = 38) undergoing lower extremity bypass grafts (N = 41) with autologous veins. Pulse wave velocity (PWV), luminal diameter, and wall thickness measurements were obtained by duplex ultrasound scan intraoperatively and at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively for assessment of graft dimensions and wall stiffness.\nLower extremity vein grafts showed an increase in PWV (from 16 +/- 1 to 21 +/- 3 cm/s; mean +/- SEM; P =.08), reflecting an increase in wall stiffness (from 1.2 +/- 0.2 to 2.5 +/- 0.7 x 10(6) dynes/cm; P =.02) and wall thickness (from 0.47 +/- 0.03 to 0.61 +/- 0.004 mm; P =.04) over the first 6 months after implantation. Changes in lumen diameter were positively correlated with changes in external graft diameter (P <.01) and negatively correlated with initial lumen diameter (P <.01) but not with changes in the wall thickness.\nThese results suggest complex remodeling of vein grafts during the first several months after implantation, with increased wall thickness occurring independent of variable changes in lumen diameter. Simultaneously, a marked increase in wall stiffness over this interval suggests a likely role for collagen deposition.",

    "abstract": "Severe circumferential calcification of the outflow artery during lower-extremity distal revascularization is considered a poor prognostic factor for bypass graft patency. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of circumferential infrapopliteal arterial calcification on bypass graft patency and limb salvage rates, comparing patency and limb salvage rates in unclampable calcified distal outflow arteries with those observed in uncalcified distal outflow arteries.\nFrom July 1990 to July 1997, of 441 distal bypass graft procedures performed by the same surgeon, 69 (16%, group I) involved unclampable calcified outflow vessels, whereas 83 (19%, group II) outflow vessels were uncalcified; the other 289 (65%) had varying intermediate degrees of calcification and were not included in this analysis. All procedures were performed for limb-threatening ischemia and involved standard vein patch angioplasty of the distal anastomotic site, irrespective of the conduit used. Primary and secondary patency, limb salvage, and survival rates were assessed by using Kaplan-Meier analysis.\nGroups were similar with regard to age, sex, and atherosclerotic risk factors except for a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus (88% vs 65%, P =.001) and renal failure (17% vs 5%, P =.01), including dialysis dependency (P =.01) in group I. Gangrene as an indication for surgery was statistically more frequent in group I (49% vs 29%, P =.01). The distal anastomotic locations and types of conduit involved were similar in the two groups. The femoral inflow level was used more often in group II (63% vs 38%, P =.003), the popliteal in group I (32% vs 17%, P =.03). Follow-up ranged from 30 days to 144 months, with a mean of 69 months. None of the patients were lost during the follow-up period. None of the patients died during the perioperative (30-day) period. Primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 84%, 65%, and 52% for group I and 89%, 76%, and 69% for group II (P =.07.). Secondary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 96%, 82%, and 78% for group I and 96%, 85%, and 82% for group II (P =.58). Limb salvage rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 93%, 83%, and 81% for group I and 97%, 90%, and 86% for group II (P =.39).\nDistal revascularization to unclampable, severely calcified outflow arteries can achieve much the same results to those obtained in uncalcified outflow arteries. A circumferentially calcified distal recipient artery should not be considered a major obstacle to an attempt at limb salvage bypass graft surgery.",

    "abstract": "The purpose was to compare the changes in claudication pain, ambulatory function, daily physical activity, peripheral circulation, and health-related quality of life following a program of exercise rehabilitation in smoking and nonsmoking patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) limited by intermittent claudication. Methods and results Thirty-nine smokers (63 +/- 4 pack-year smoking history; mean +/- SE) and 46 nonsmokers (former smokers who had a 51 +/- 7 pack-year smoking history who quit 14 +/- 2 years prior to investigation) completed the study. The 6-month exercise rehabilitation program consisted of intermittent treadmill walking to near maximal claudication pain 3 days per week, with progressive increases in walking duration and intensity during the program. Measurements were obtained on each patient before and after rehabilitation. Following exercise rehabilitation the smokers and nonsmokers had similar improvements in these measures, as initial claudication distance increased by 119% in the smokers (P <.001) and by 97% in the nonsmokers (P <.001), and absolute claudication distance increased by 82% (P <.001) and 59% (P <.001) in the smokers and nonsmokers, respectively. Furthermore, exercise rehabilitation improved (P <.05) ambulatory function, daily physical activity, peripheral circulation, and health-related quality of life in the smokers and nonsmokers.\nExercise rehabilitation is an effective therapy to improve functional independence in both smoking and nonsmoking patients with PAD limited by intermittent claudication. Therefore, smokers with intermittent claudication are prime candidates for exercise rehabilitation because their relatively low baseline physical function does not impair their ability to regain lost functional independence to levels similar to nonsmoking patients with PAD.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine relationships between lower-extremity arterial obstruction, leg strength, and lower-extremity functioning.\nThe study design was cross-sectional. A total of 514 outpatients (269 with ankle-brachial index [ABI] <0.90), aged 55 and older, were identified from three Chicago-area hospitals. Individuals with history of lower-extremity revascularization were excluded. Main outcome measures Strength in each leg, 6-minute walk, 4-meter walking velocity, accelerometer-measured physical activity, and a summary performance score were measured. The summary performance score is a composite measure of lower-extremity functioning, ranging from 0 to 12 (12 = best). The leg with the lower ABI was defined as the \"index\" leg, and the leg with higher ABI was defined as the \"contralateral\" leg.\nIndex leg ABI levels were associated linearly and significantly with strength for hip extension (P <.001), hip flexion (P <.001), knee extension (P =.066), and knee flexion (P =.003), adjusting for known and potential confounders. In adjusted analyses, the index ABI was also associated linearly and significantly with strength in the contralateral leg. Adjusting for confounders, including ABI, knee extension strength, was associated independently with functional measures.\nAmong patients without prior leg revascularization, strength in each leg is highly correlated with the lower-leg ABI. Leg strength is associated independently with functional performance. Further study is needed to determine whether lower-extremity resistance training improves functioning in patients with peripheral arterial disease.",

    "abstract": "To estimate the dosage needed for continuous infusion and to investigate whether continuous infusion of the ultrasound contrast-enhancing agent Levovist (SH U 508A) can improve duplex scanning of crural arteries in patients with peripheral arterial obstructive disease (PAOD) eligible for distal bypass graft surgery.\nThe study design consisted of two parts. Part 1 investigated the color and spectral Doppler scan enhancement of three different Levovist dosages (200, 300, and 400 mg/mL) in one arterial segment of a patent lumen of a crural artery in seven patients with PAOD. Part 2 investigated the value of the optimum Levovist dosage in the assessment of 10 crural arteries in 10 consecutive patients with PAOD. Angiography was the reference standard.\nPart 1: Levovist significantly enhanced color and spectral Doppler scan as compared with baseline ultrasound scan, but no differences were found between the Levovist dosages. Thus, the lowest Levovist dosage sufficed for application in part 2, because of its infusion volume and prolonged enhancement time. Part 2: The agreement between contrast-enhanced duplex scanning and angiography was moderate (kappa = 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.97). Five (50%) of 10 crural arteries that could not adequately be visualized with routine duplex scanning could be visualized with contrast-enhanced duplex scanning.\nContrast-enhanced duplex scanning by means of continuous infusion of Levovist in patients with PAOD improves the ultrasound scan investigation of crural arteries in case routine duplex scanning is inconclusive and might reduce the need for angiography.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an independent risk factor for peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). However, the relationship between dietary folate and vitamin B6, cofactors in the metabolism of homocysteine (Hcy), and PAOD is unclear.\nTo study the relationship between dietary folate and B6 and PAOD.\nCase-control population based study of 392 men older than 50 years living in Huntingdon, United Kingdom. PAOD, defined as an ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) < 0.9, was present in 86 (22%) of subjects. Folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 intakes were calculated by means of the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer) food frequency questionnaire.\nDaily folate intake was significantly lower in case subjects (mean, 288; 95% confidence interval [CI], 266-309 microg) than in control subjects (324; 95% CI, 313-335 microg). Daily vitamin B6 intake was also lower in case subjects (2.05; 95% CI, 1.92-2.19 mg versus 2.26; 95% CI, 2.19-2.33 mg). Daily folate and vitamin B6 intakes were independent predictors of PAOD after adjusting for age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes, and smoking status in a logistic regression model. This model suggests that increasing daily folate intake by 1 standard deviation decreased the risk of PAOD by 46%. A similar increase in daily vitamin B6 intake decreased the risk of PAOD by 29%.\nIn men older than 50 years, dietary folate and B6 intakes are independent predictors of PAOD. Longitudinal studies are required to determine whether dietary modification can reduce the incidence of PAOD in the population.",

Twelve patients with renal failure who had undergone preoperative dialysis were excluded from the study. Of the remaining 347 patients, ARF developed in 81 (23%) after TAAA repair. Forty-four (54%) of the 81 patients with ARF received cold visceral perfusion, and 37 (46%) patients received warm visceral perfusion. ARF was defined as either an increase of 1 mg/dL in serum creatinine (SCr) concentration per day for 2 consecutive days or dialysis requirement. Patient records were reviewed through hospital discharge.\nTwenty six (32%) of the 81 patients in whom ARF developed died, 17 of 37 (46%) patients in the warm perfusion group versus 9 of 44 (21%) patients in the cold perfusion group (P <.02).

    "abstract": "Open repair (OR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is a major surgical procedure with elevated morbidity and a low but definite mortality. Advocates of endovascular repair (EVAR) claim decreased complication rates and outcome equal to OR.\nData of all patients with infrarenal AAA that was treated electively, both with OR and EVAR, at Mayo Clinic Rochester between December 1, 1999 and December 1, 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. Thirty-day morbidity and mortality and early clinical outcomes were assessed and compared.\nThree hundred fifty-five patients underwent treatment: 261 patients, including 229 males and 32 females (mean age: 73 years; range: 52 to 90 years) underwent OR, and 94 patients including 85 males and 9 females (mean age: 77 years; range: 61 to 98 years) underwent EVAR (AneuRx: 53, Ancure: 38, Endologix: 3). Median AAA size was 57 mm in both groups. There were more high-risk patients in the EVAR group (27% vs 14%, P =.007). Thirty-day mortality rates were 1.1 % (3/261) for OR and 0 for EVAR (P = NS). Cardiac and pulmonary complications were less frequent after EVAR (11% vs 22%, P =.02, and 3% vs 16%, P =.001, respectively), but graft-related complications were more frequent (13% vs 4%, P =.002). The association between type of repair and cardiac, pulmonary, and graft complications remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, gender, and high-risk status. The multivariate odds ratios (EVAR vs OR) for cardiac, pulmonary, and graft complications were 0.35 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17 to 0.74), 0.14 (95% CI: 0.04 to 0.47), and 3.81 (95% CI: 1.51 to 9.58), respectively. Primary and secondary patency and freedom-from-reintervention rates at 1 year were lower after EVAR (83% vs 98%, P <.001; 96% vs 99%, P =.02; 65% vs 93%, P <.001, respectively).\nBoth elective OR and EVAR can be performed with low mortality, but cardiac and pulmonary complications are less frequent and less severe after EVAR. The tradeoff of EVAR is a higher rate of graft-related complications, with more reinterventions and a lower graft patency rate at 1 year. These results should be considered before EVAR is offered to patients with AAA.",

    "abstract": "Small patient numbers, mixed data from clinical trials, and longitudinal series representing institutional learning curves have characterized previous studies of early outcomes after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. We compared the perioperative outcomes of endovascular and open surgical AAA repair in an unselected sample of patients in a single calendar year using a national administrative database.\nThe 2001 National Inpatient Sample database was retrospectively reviewed. This database represents 20% of all-payer stratified sample of non-federal US hospitals. Patients older than 49 years were identified by primary diagnostic codes (International Classification of Disease, ninth revision [ICD-9], 441.4, intact, nonruptured AAA) and procedure codes (ICD-9 38.44 for open, 39.71 for endovascular repair). Patient demographic data (age, sex), comorbid conditions (ICD-9 coded), inpatient complications (ICD-9 coded), length of stay, final discharge disposition (home vs institution vs death), and hospital charges were examined with univariate and multivariate analyses.\nIn calendar year 2001, 7172 patients underwent either open (64%) or endovascular (36%) repair of intact, nonruptured AAAs. Despite comparable rates of preoperative comorbid conditions and a greater proportion of octogenarians (23% vs 16%%; P =.0001), morbidity (18% vs 29%; P =.0001) and mortality (1.3% vs 3.8%; P =.0001) were significantly lower for endovascular repair than for open repair. The median length of stay (2 vs 7 days; P =.0001) and the rate of discharge to an institutional facility versus home (6% vs 14%; P =.0001) were also much lower in the endovascular group than in the open repair group. At multivariate analysis, open AAA repair and age older than 80 years were strong independent predictors (P =.0001 for all) for death (open repair: odds ratio [OR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-4.9; age: OR, 14.2; 95% CI, 3.5-58.1), complications (open repair: OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.7-2.1; age: OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5-2.5), and not being discharged to home (open repair: OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.9-4.1; age: OR, 12.0; 95% CI, 7.0-20.4). Mean hospital charges were significantly greater (difference, $3337; P =.0009) for endovascular repair than for open repair. Extrapolated to the total number of endovascular AAA repairs performed during the single 2001 calendar year, this resulted in a staggering $50.3 million in additional hospital charges.\nEndovascular repair of intact AAAs results in a significantly lower number of complications and deaths, shorter hospital stay, and improved likelihood of discharge to home, even in older patients, when compared with open surgical repair. These impressive gains in clinical outcome, however, are achieved at similarly impressive increases in health care costs.",

We also conducted a targeted review to seek information about clinical presentation, to hasten diagnosis and assist in therapeutic management.\nA 54-year-old man with retroperitoneal hemorrhage associated with an arcuate ligament division, documented on computed tomographic scans, underwent diagnostic arteriography and embolization to treat the bleeding aneurysm. In a second elective operation the causative arcuate ligament was sectioned to decompress the celiac artery, to prevent aneurysm recurrence.\nEmbolization stopped the aneurysmal bleeding, and arteriograms showed that surgical sectioning resolved the celiac trunk stenosis. At 1-year follow-up the patient had no signs of complications or recurrence of disease.\nRuptured aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal arteries associated with stenosis of the celiac trunk is a surgical emergency. Although a literature review disclosed no significant difference between outcomes after open surgery and radiologic arterial embolization, our experience in this case suggests immediate embolization during arteriography as the most effective treatment. Later, to prevent recurrence, the arcuate ligament should be surgically sectioned and the celiac artery stenosis treated.",

We describe a case of a 77-year-old woman who underwent surgical correction of a debilitating spinal deformity at an outside institution. Postoperative thoracic spine radiographs and computed tomography scans revealed a misplaced pedicle screw at T5, which was impinging on the descending thoracic aortic wall. The patient was brought to the operating room, where a thoracic stent graft was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance as the malpositioned screw was manually retracted. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and was discharged within 24 hours. This case represents a rare but potentially morbid vascular complication of spinal instrumentation surgery that was successfully treated without the need for thoracotomy.",

While the arterial axis, which was not dilated at closure, became aneurysmal, it is remarkable that the vein bypass performed at the same time was not altered.

    "abstract": "We previously showed that treatment with liposomally encapsulated dichloromethylene bisphosphonate reduces intimal hyperplasia development and macrophage accumulation in a rat epigastric vein to femoral artery model of intimal hyperplasia. Our objective in this study was to determine the effect of liposomally encapsulated dichloromethylene bisphosphonate on the expression of two cytokines essential to neointimal development, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta).\nWe injected rats both 2 days preoperatively and 2 weeks postoperatively with liposomally encapsulated dichloromethylene bisphosphonate (Lip-Clod), liposomally encapsulated phosphate-buffered saline solution (Vector), or phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS), and harvested the grafts at 1 and 4 weeks. In the perianastomotic region, MCP-1 and TGF-beta protein expression in the total graft cross-section and in the neointima was determined with immunohistochemistry. In whole-graft lysates, MCP-1 and TGF-beta protein were determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and messenger RNA expression was determined with reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction.\nLip-Clod treatment reduced intimal hyperplasia when compared with Vector or PBS treatment. These reductions were significant (P<.05) at both time points. When compared with the PBS treatment, at 1 week but not at 4 weeks Lip-Clod reduced both MCP-1 and TGF-beta protein (P< or =.01 and P< or =.006) in the perianastomotic region of vein grafts. In whole-graft lysates, no significant difference was seen in MCP-1 protein at either time point; however, TGF-beta protein expression was significantly reduced at both 1 and 4 weeks (P=.02 and P=.004). Message analysis in whole-graft lysates at 1 week showed that MCP-1 message expression increased in the Lip-Clod group compared with the PBS group (P=.02), but no significant differences among groups for TGF-beta message levels. Results with Vector were often intermediate to results with Lip-Clod and PBS.\nThe major effect of Lip-Clod treatment on TGF-beta and MCP-1 protein levels in the perianastomotic region is observed at 1 week, and macrophage depletion with Lip-Clod inhibits graft neointimal hyperplasia and TGF-beta protein expression in whole-graft lysates at 1 and 4 weeks. These results support the concept that the infiltrating macrophages contribute a significant portion of the cytokines that facilitate intimal hyperplasia and that reducing these cytokines early after grafting influences the development of intimal hyperplasia at later time points.\nAll vascular surgeons have patients who have undergone a technically satisfying vein graft, only to have the bypass fail during the first year due to perianastomotic intimal hyperplasia (IH). We hypothesize that vein graft IH is analogous to aberrant wound healing. Central to wound healing is the recruitment of macrophages with their cytokines. This work raises the question whether clinical strategies designed to either decrease macrophages or the cytokines released by macrophages at the time of vein graft placement will be efficacious for limiting the development of IH.",

    "abstract": "Enhanced production of superoxide in L-arginine-depleted environments and concomitant reduction of nitric oxide (NO) concentration are involved in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Treatment with L-arginine or antioxidative vitamins alone and in combination was used to mollify I/R injury in skeletal muscle. Untreated rabbits were compared with those treated with L-arginine/antioxidative vitamin cocktail Omnibionta only, or a combination of L-arginine/ antioxidative vitamins during hind limb I/R (2.5 hours/2 hours). NO was continuously measured in vivo. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) served as the measure of oxygen free radical formation. Interstitial edema formation, microvessel diameter alterations, microvessel plugging, and blood flow changes were used as indicators of I/R injury. The MDA level in untreated animals 2 hours after reperfusion was significantly higher than in control animals (0.81 micromol/L +/- 0.14 micromol/L vs 0.57 micromol/L +/- 0.11 micromol/L; P<.05), indicating enhanced production of oxygen free radicals. This sequela paralleled the decreasing concentration of NO, which dropped below the detection limit (1 nmol/L) after reperfusion. Microvascular changes during I/R injury were expressed as a 40% decrease in microvessel diameter and adhesion of neutrophils in 20% of microvessels, which led to a consequent 60% reduction in blood flow, demonstrating \"no reflow\" (reperfusion failure after restoration of blood flow). The increase in the fraction of muscle interfiber area by 85% indicated prominent edema formation. Treatment with antioxidative vitamins alone had a minimally positive effect on edema formation and microvascular plugging, possibly by suppression of oxygen free radical production, as expressed by the reduction in plasma MDA levels. However, this therapy failed to preserve basal NO production and to protect from microvascular constriction and no reflow. Treatment with L-arginine alone had a stronger protective effect, maintaining basal NO production, further reduction of neutrophil plugging, abolition of microvascular constriction, and no reflow. The combination of antioxidative vitamins and L-arginine was the best treatment against I/R injury, expressed not only by the protection of microvessel constriction, but also by abolition of microvascular plugging, increase in NO production (68 nmol/L +/- 5 nmol/L) over the basal level (52 nmol/L +/- 7 nmol/L), and higher blood flow, as compared with treatment with L-arginine or antioxidative vitamins alone.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to grow \"artificial blood vessels\" for autologous transplantation as arterial interposition grafts in a large animal model (dog).\nTubing up to 250 mm long, either bare or wrapped in biodegradable polyglycolic acid (Dexon) or nonbiodegradable polypropylene (Prolene) mesh, was inserted in the peritoneal or pleural cavity of dogs, using minimally invasive techniques, and tethered at one end to the wall with a loose suture. After 3 weeks the tubes and their tissue capsules were harvested, and the inert tubing was discarded. The wall of living tissue was uniformly 1-1.5 mm thick throughout its length, and consisted of multiple layers of myofibroblasts and matrix overlaid with a single layer of mesothelium. The myofibroblasts stained for alpha-smooth muscle actin, vimentin, and desmin. The bursting strength of tissue tubes with no biodegradable mesh scaffolds was in excess of 2500 mm Hg, and the suture holding strength was 11.5 N, both similar to that in dog carotid and femoral arteries. Eleven tissue tubes were transplanted as interposition grafts into the femoral artery of the same dog in which they were grown, and were harvested after 3 to 6.5 months. Eight remained patent during this time. At harvest, their lumens were lined with endothelium-like cells, and wall cells stained for alpha-actin, smooth muscle myosin, desmin and smoothelin; there was also a thick \"adventitia\" containing vasa vasorum.\nPeritoneal and pleural cavities of large animals can function as bioreactors to grow myofibroblast tubes for use as autologous vascular grafts.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair is an alternative treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The procedure is less invasive, and morbidity and most probably mortality are reduced. However, some problems, such as endoleakage, are yet to be resolved. Endoleakage can occur after graft migration, as a result of insufficient fixation of the stent graft. One cause is deficient healing between the aortic neck and the stent graft. We hypothesize that better healing, achieved by induction of vascular cell ingrowth into the graft material, results in better graft fixation. Previously we demonstrated ingrowth of neointima into the graft material if the stent graft is impregnated with a coat of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), heparin, and collagen. In this study we evaluated healing with bFGF-heparin-collagen-coated stent grafts in vivo.\nIn 4 pigs, 32 endovascular stent grafts, manufactured from standard Dacron and Gianturco Z-stents, were placed in the aorta. The stent grafts were impregnated with either bFGF-heparin containing collagen (n=16) or control collagen (n=16). After 4 and 8 weeks animals were killed, and ingrowth and healing of the stent grafts were macroscopically and electron microscopically evaluated.\nAfter 8 weeks all bFGF-impregnated stent grafts demonstrated ingrowth of tissue and healing between the graft and the aorta, whereas the control nonimpregnated stent grafts showed no ingrowth. Microscopic evaluation demonstrated alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells, most probably smooth muscle cells or myofibroblasts, growing from the vascular wall through the graft material.\nA Dacron prosthesis impregnated with collagen, heparin, and bFGF induced graft healing in an in vivo pig model, in contrast to nonimpregnated stent grafts. This in vivo study confirms our previous findings in vitro. These results indicate that healing between Dacron and the aorta can be achieved, and suggest that type I endoleakage may be resolved by inducing healing between the aortic wall and the prosthesis with graft material containing growth factor.",

    "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) inhibits post-interventional stenosis in balloon-injured arteries, but causes thrombosis when applied to vein grafts. This may result from added free radicals produced during the hypoxia-reperfusion injury of vein graft implantation. The purposes of this study were to determine whether a free radical scavenger could inhibit vein graft thrombosis, enabling PDT to inhibit intimal hyperplasia; and to investigate the role of neutrophils, also a source of radicals, in this setting.\nJugular vein bypass grafts of the common carotid artery were performed in rats. PDT was administered in situ to the vein graft and artery in the presence or absence of deferoxamine (DFX), an OH- scavenger.\nPDT alone induced thrombosis in all untreated vein grafts. DFX administration or inhibition of neutrophil adhesion to the graft prevented PDT-induced vein graft thrombosis. Moreover, DFX given together with PDT significantly decreased vein graft intimal hyperplasia (0.010 mm2 +/- 0.005 mm2; P<.002) as compared with DFX alone (0.113 mm2 +/- 0.009 mm2) or untreated control animals (0.112 +/- 0.007 mm2).\nOH- radicals and neutrophils both have key roles in PDT-induced vein graft thrombosis. By inhibiting free radical production or neutrophil adhesion to the graft, adequate PDT can be administered for successful inhibition of vein graft intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "The popliteal artery is, after the aorta, the most common site for aneurysm formation. Why the popliteal artery is more susceptible than other peripheral muscular arteries is unknown. An important factor may be differences in arterial wall composition as compared with other peripheral muscular arteries, which in turn affect wall properties. These are however unknown. We studied the mechanical wall properties of the popliteal artery in healthy subjects.\nAn ultrasound echo-tracking system was used to measure pulsatile changes in popliteal diameter in 108 healthy subjects (56 female, 52 male; age range, 9-82 years). In combination with blood pressure, stiffness (beta), strain, cross-sectional artery wall compliance coefficient (CC), and distensibility coefficient (DC) were calculated. Intima-media thickness (IMT) was registered with a Philips P700 ultrasound scanner.\nThe popliteal diameter increased with age, and was larger in male subjects than in female subjects (P<.001). Fractional diameter change (strain) decreased with age (P<.001), and strain values were lower in male subjects than in female subjects (P<.01). Accordingly, stiffness increased with age (P<.001), with higher stiffness values in male subjects (P<.01). DC decreased with age (P<.001), with lower DC values in male subjects (P<.01). CC decreased with age, with no difference between genders (P<.001). IMT increased with age (P<.001), with higher IMT values in male subjects (P<.001). The increase in IMT did not affect distensibility.\nThe wall properties of the popliteal artery are affected by age and gender, not only with an increase in diameter, but also with an age-related decrease in distensibility, with male subjects having lower distensibility than in female subjects. This seems not to be the behavior of a true muscular artery, but of a central elastic artery, such as the aorta, and might have implications for susceptibility to arterial dilatation, as well as the association of aneurysm formation between the aorta and the popliteal artery.\nThe popliteal artery is, after the abdominal aorta, the most common location for aneurysm formation in the arterial system. Why it is more susceptible than other arteries is unknown. This study shows that the wall function of the popliteal artery differs from other peripheral arteries, and instead show striking similarities to the abdominal aorta, indicating that the functional arrangement of arterial wall components are similar in the two arteries. This may have implications for the susceptibility to aneurysm formation, as well as the association of dilating disease between the popliteal artery and the abdominal aorta.",

    "abstract": "A surgical strategy for treating malignant renal tumors with thrombus extending into the inferior vena cava (IVC) was assessed.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the records for all patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC; n=30) or Wilms tumor (n=1) with tumor thrombus extending into the IVC who underwent surgical intervention at our institution between January 1980 and December 2001. Tumors were classified preoperatively according to the cephalad extension of thrombus, and intraoperative procedures were selected on the basis of degree of extension. Patients with RCC underwent radical nephrectomy and removal of thrombus with (n=11) or without (n=19) IVC resection. Partial normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass without cardiac arrest was used in 4 patients. The Pringle maneuver was performed in 8 patients. Infrarenal abdominal aortic cross-clamping was used in 8 patients to maintain systemic blood pressure. IVC cross-clamping and the Pringle maneuver were performed in 5 patients with suprahepatic thrombus extension. Temporary placement of a filter in the IVC or plication of the IVC above the hepatic vein was performed before hepatic mobilization, to decrease the risk for pulmonary embolism.\nOne patient died intraoperatively of pulmonary embolism. Postoperative complications occurred in 11 patients; all resolved with conservative therapy. The postoperative duration of survival in patients with RCC was 37 +/- 44 months (range, 4-180 months); the 5-year survival rate was 42%.\nAortic cross-clamping during IVC occlusion prevented hypotension and maintained hemodynamic stability that has required bypass in other series. This surgical treatment with the less extensive approach could result in long-term survival of patients with RCC in whom tumor thrombus extends into the IVC. We recommend that radical nephrectomy and tumor thrombectomy, with or without caval resection, be performed in these patients, with less invasive additional maneuvers.",

The relationship between CEAP clinical classification and patient-perceived quality of life (QOL) has not been evaluated, but is important for the selection and interpretation of outcomes in clinical studies of patients with CVD. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether CVD, as classified with CEAP, is related to patient-reported QOL, and to identify patient characteristics associated with CEAP class and QOL that need to be considered when interpreting outcomes in CVD.\nThe Venous Insufficiency Epidemiologic and Economic Study (VEINES) population is an international cohort of 1531 patients with CVD recruited in Belgium, France, Italy, and Canada. At the baseline visit patients were categorized into one of seven CEAP clinical categories on the basis of a clinical examination, and completed standardized generic (Short-Form Health Survey, 36 items [SF-36]) and venous disease-specific (QOL [VEINES-QOL] and symptom severity [VEINES-Sym]) QOL questionnaires. Multivariate analyses were used to examine the relationship between CEAP class and QOL.\nThe proportion of patients in the seven CEAP classes (class 0-6) was 3.8%, 13.3%, 24.1%, 12.8%, 36.4%, 7.3%, and 2.3%, respectively. In univariate analyses, SF-36 Physical Component Summary scores and VEINES-QOL and VEINES-Sym scores decreased significantly (ie, poorer QOL) with increasing CEAP class. Multivariate analyses controlling for age, sex, country, education, body mass index, years since CVD onset and comorbid conditions confirmed findings for VEINES-QOL and VEINES-Sym (P<.0001 and P<.0001, respectively).\nPhysician-evaluated clinical category, based on the CEAP classification, predicts patient-reported QOL and symptom severity in CVD.",

All repeat operation specimens were obtained in our Department of Vascular Surgery; the original operations in our patients (age 56 +/- 11 years) had been performed in different centers and private practices 12.1 +/- 8.1 years previously.\nSingle-channel recurrence was observed in 63 groins. In 62 the vein wall structure was complex; and 18 demonstrated venous valves. These vessels could be classified as residual stumps of the GSV. Just one single-channel recurrent vessel lined with endothelium and surrounded by scar tissue was detected, and was judged to be neovascular. Multichannel recurrent vessels were found in 28 groins. Twenty-three of these were thin-walled tortuous vessels embedded in scar tissue, and were interpreted as neovascular; 4 were multiple vessels surrounded by fatty tissue and were classified as venule hypertrophy; and 1 was a lymph node that contained numerous channels, and was attributed to lymphovenous connections.\nOriginal misidentification of the SFJ, as evidenced by an identifiable GSV stump with appropriate histologic features, characterized 68% (62 of 91) of these symptomatic groins. Neovascularity, marked by multiple irregular channels with an incomplete wall structure, was observed in 26% of the groins (24 of 91), accounting for 94% of the recurrent vessels. The findings at repeat operation, supported by analysis of histologic tissue sections, imply that better supervision and training or case concentration in centers of excellence should be more effective in decreasing the incidence of recurrent SFJ reflux after SFJ ligation and GSV stripping than putative operative maneuvers directed at reducing neovascularization.",

    "abstract": "We noted substantial differences when measuring repeatedly the same abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) on the same computed tomography (CT) scan. This study quantitated this variability, and methods to minimize it were developed.\nThe CT maximal diameter of 25 AAAs was measured by eight experienced observers, including six vascular surgeons and two radiologists, using two methods: an unstandardized protocol, and a standardized protocol using fine calipers to carefully measure the largest diameter perpendicular to the estimated aneurysm centerline, from outer aneurysm wall to outer wall. The average measurement difference between observers was calculated for each method. The average difference between each observer's measurement and the official radiology report value was also calculated. Agreement between the two measurement methods was assessed with Bland-Altman plots.\nThe difference in maximal diameter measurements between each observer averaged 4.0 +/- 5.1 mm (range, 0.0-35.0 mm) with the unstandardized method. The mean measurement difference with the standardized protocol was significantly lower, and averaged 2.8 +/- 4.4 mm (range, 0.0-26.0 mm; P<.05). Measurements taken from the official radiology report differed from each of the observer's standardized measurement by an average of 5.0 +/- 6.3 mm (range, 0.0-28.0 mm). This difference was similar for both the unstandardized and standardized methods. Bland-Altman plots confirmed the wide variation of the maximal diameter measurements when the unstandardized method was compared with the standardized method (95% confidence interval, -9-9 mm).\nRoutine CT maximal diameter measurement of AAAs can have substantial interobserver variability. Standardized measurement protocols can decrease, but not eliminate, this measurement variability. Thus apparent size changes based on CT measurements may represent measurement artifact rather than actual aneurysm growth or shrinkage, particularly when a standardized system is not used.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to determine whether there is deterioration in renal function during follow-up in patients who have undergone endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), as recommended by the device manufacturers; to determine whether suprarenal fixation correlates with impairment of renal function; and to explore the potential implication of life-long surveillance of renal function with contrast-enhanced computed tomography.\nOne hundred forty-six consecutive patients underwent EVAR at our institution. Data from 113 of these patients who were free from preoperative renal insufficiency or postoperative renal disease were analyzed. Fifty-three patients received infrarenal (IR) fixation devices, and 60 patients received suprarenal (SR) fixation devices. All SR fixation devices were placed under investigational device exemption protocols. The average follow-up was 688 days. Sixty-five consecutive patients who had undergone open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) served as the control group.\nPreoperative creatinine concentration, intraoperative blood loss, contrast volume, and number of contrast-enhanced procedures were not significantly different between the IR and SR groups. Two renal artery occlusions (1 SR, 1 IR; P=NS) were identified, and 8 renal infarcts (5 SR, 3 IR; P=NS). There was an increase in mean creatinine concentration in the open AAA, IR, and SR fixation groups at each time point in the analysis. Mean elevation in creatinine concentration at 12, 24, and 36 months was 0.10, 0.10, and 0.04 mg/dL, respectively, for open AAA repair; 0.20, 0.21, and 0.28 mg/dL for IR fixation; and 0.15, 0.21, and 0.12 mg/dL for SR fixation. At life table analysis, renal impairment at 36 months was seen in 36% +/- 9% of patients in the IR group, 25% +/- % of patients in the SR group, and 19% +/- 6% of patients in the open AAA group (P=.04 for IR fixation vs open AAA repair).\nA decrease in kidney function is seen after EVAR, regardless of fixation level, that is independent of renal disease and renal arterial occlusion. In patients with normal renal function the site of proximal fixation does not affect postoperative creatinine concentration. The decrease in renal function is likely related to the repetitive administration of contrast agent.",

    "abstract": "Emergent repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAAs) is associated with high perioperative morbidity and mortality. One of the significant complications of this surgery is bowel ischemia. Reports detail mortality as high as 80% when this condition is realized. The objective of this project was to determine both the incidence and the effect of mandatory postoperative colonoscopy on outcome of colon ischemia after rAAA.\nFrom July 1995 to September 2002 all patients with an rAAA who underwent emergent aortic reconstruction were included in this review. All colonoscopies were performed within 48 hours, ischemia was graded consistently, and treatment was initiated per protocol based on grade of ischemia. Patients with grades I and II ischemia were followed up with medical management and repeat colonoscopy. All patients with grade III ischemia underwent bowel resection. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were collected to assess possible independent risk factors for and predictors of bowel ischemia.\nEighty-eight patients underwent emergent aortic reconstruction because of rAAA in the study period. Their mean age was 73 years, and 64 patients (72%) were men. Operative mortality was 42%. Eighteen percent of patients died within 24 hours, and 24% died between 1 and 30 days after surgery. Colonoscopy was performed in 62 of 72 patients who survived more than 24 hours. Bowel ischemia was documented in 26 of the 72 patients (36%). Of these, 16 patients had grade I or grade II ischemia at both initial and repeat endoscopy. Nine patients underwent exploratory laparotomy with bowel resection because of grade III ischemia; two procedures were performed because of worsening ischemia discovered at repeat colonoscopy. In patients with colonoscopic findings of bowel ischemia the mortality rate was 50% (13 of 26 patients). In those with grade III necrosis who underwent resection the mortality rate was 55%. Elevated lactate levels, immature white blood cells, and increased fluid sequestration were all variables associated with the occurrence of colon ischemia.\nBowel ischemia is a frequent postoperative complication (42%) of repaired rAAA. Performing mandatory surveillance colonoscopy in these patients may be associated with a decrease in overall mortality and improved survival in patients with transmural bowel necrosis with no comorbid condition.",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in surgery, anaesthesia, and critical care, mortality from ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) has not decreased over the last 20 years. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of ruptured AAAs is an alternative to open repair, which may improve outcome. However, a computed tomography (CT) scan is usually required to assess the anatomic suitability of the aneurysm for EVAR. This may result in delay in transferring patients to the operating room. We evaluated all patients admitted to hospital with a ruptured AAA who died without undergoing surgery, to determine time to death after AAA rupture and thus the potential time available for obtaining a CT scan.\nA retrospective case note review was conducted of 56 patients admitted to a single center with ruptured AAAs who did not undergo surgery because of advanced age or associated comorbidity over 8 years from 1995 to 2003. Statistical analysis was performed with the Fisher exact test.\nThe 56 patients (33 men, 59%; 23 women, 41%) had a median age of 85 years (range, 71-98 years). Reasons for no operation being performed were shock (9%), cardiac arrest (11%), quality of life (29%), malignancy (7%), cardiac disease (15%), respiratory disease (16%) and age (14%). Median systolic blood pressure at admission was 110 mm Hg, heart rate was 88 beats per minute, and hemoglobin concentration was 10.5 g/dL. Patients were not aggressively resuscitated once a decision was made to not perform surgery. Death within 2 hours of hospital admission occurred in 7 (12.5%) patients, and 49 (87.5%) patients died more than 2 hours after admission. Median interval between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital was 2 hours 30 minutes (range, 44 minutes-36 hours), and the median interval between admission and death was 10 hours 45 minutes (range, 1 hour 1 minute-143 hours 55 minutes). The median total time to death from onset of symptoms was 16 hours 38 minutes (range, 2 hours 6 minutes-146 hours 50 minutes).\nMost (87.5%) patients admitted to hospital with a ruptured AAA died after more than 2 hours.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine factors associated with increased likelihood of patients undergoing surgery to repair ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Specifically, we investigated whether men were more likely than women to be selected for surgery after rupture of AAAs.\nAll patients with a ruptured AAA who came to a hospital in Ontario between April 1, 1992, and March 31, 2001, were included in this population-based retrospective study. Administrative data were used to identify patients, patient demographic data, and hospital variables.\nCrude 30-day mortality for the 3570 patients who came to a hospital with a ruptured AAA was 53.4%. Of the 2602 patients (72.9%) who underwent surgical repair, crude 30-day mortality was 41.0%. Older patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.649 per 5 years of age; P<.0001), with a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR, 0.848; P<.0001), were less likely to undergo AAA repair. Patients treated at high-volume centers (OR, 2.674 per 10 cases; P<.0001) and men (OR, 2.214; P<.0001) were more likely to undergo AAA repair.\nMen are more likely to undergo repair of a ruptured AAA than women are, for reasons that are unclear. Given the large magnitude of the effect, further studies are clearly indicated.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the consequences on patient selection and on early and midterm results of the learning curve of a surgical team performing laparoscopy-assisted surgery in the treatment of severe aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD).\nBetween January 1998 and June 2003, 58 patients (53 men, 5 women; mean age, 59.5 years [range, 37-76 years]) were included in a prospective study and underwent a laparoscopy-assisted aortofemoral reconstruction with graft implantation through a 5-cm to 8-cm minilaparotomy. Fifty-one patients (88%) had claudication (category 2 or 3, Rutherford classification), and seven patients (12%) had tissue loss; at presentation they had TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus C (n=24, 41.4 %) or D (n=32, 55.2%) iliac lesions, and the last 2 patients (3.4%) had severe aortic lesions. Perioperative data for the first 29 patients, obtained during the first 34 months of the study (group 1), were compared with data for the last 29 patients, obtained during the last 32 months of the study (group 2). Follow-up consisted of clinical examination or duplex scanning, or both, at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter, and computed tomography before discharge and then every 2 years.\nOne intraoperative surgical conversion (1.7%) was necessary, and two other patients (3.4%) died in the immediate postoperative period. With experience, initial contraindications such as obesity or suprarenal artery aortic clamping were eliminated, making it possible to increase the percentage of patients included, from 53.7% during the first 34 months to 90.6% during the last 32 months (P=.003). The mean duration of the operative procedure decreased from 285 minutes in group 1 to 192 minutes in group 2 (P<.001), and the mean duration of aortic clamping decreased from 76.4 minutes in group 1 to 31.8 minutes in group 2 (P<.001). The number of early repeat interventions was reduced from three (10.3%) in group 1 to 2 (6.9%) in group 2 (P=NS), and the clinical recovery period decreased from 7 days to 4.5 days (P=.05). During a mean follow-up of 26.7 months (range, 1-66 months) there were 5 repeat surgeries (9%) to treat late graft occlusion, establishing midterm primary and secondary patency rates of 89.3% and 91%, respectively. No aortic false aneurysms were detected, and no major amputations were performed.\nThese preliminary results assess the feasability and the safety of this minimally invasive video-assisted technique. A short period of postoperative recovery and good midterm patency rate are the two main benefits of this new surgical option.",

    "abstract": "Laparoscopically assisted aortic aneurysm resection requiring a minilaparotomy can be performed as a routine procedure. It was the purpose of our study to evaluate whether a total laparoscopic operation can be offered to aneurysm patients as a minimally invasive alternative. We also wanted to test whether a master-slave robot could facilitate the total laparoscopic procedure.\nA prospective, consecutive number of 50 patients was evaluated. A transperitoneal left retrocolic access was used to expose the aorta. If possible, a tube graft repair was performed. The aortic anastomosis was sutured totally laparoscopically, with the surgeon standing on the right side of the operating table. In 10 consecutive patients, the anastomosis was sutured with the help of the Zeus robot.\nAfter excluding 3 cases that required suprarenal cross-clamping, 47 patients were operated using a total laparoscopic approach. A totally laparoscopic operation could be performed successfully in 39 patients with aneurysms. In 8 patients (17%), conversion to a laparoscopic hand-assisted operation with a 7-cm minilaparotomy was required. The robot was used to perform the aortic anastomosis in 10 patients. In 8 patients, a tube graft repair could successfully be performed totally laparoscopically. In the remaining patients, a bifurcated graft was implanted laparoscopically. The mean operating time was 227 minutes in the laparoscopy group and was 242 minutes in those patients in whom the anastomosis was sutured with the help of the Zeus Robot. Mean cross-clamping time, +/- SD, was 81.4 + 31 minutes. None of the patients died perioperatively. Major complications occurred in three patients (6.3%). The overall morbidity was 14.8%, including one patient who required temporary hemodialysis postoperatively. The time to suture the aortic anastomosis was significantly shorter in the robotic-assistance group (40.8 +/- 4 minutes), yet total operating time was longer in this group because of the technical complexity of the robotic device. Patients with a total laparoscopic procedure asked for significantly fewer analgesics and could regain full mobility earlier compared with those patients for whom a minilaparotomy after conversion to the laparoscopic hand-assist procedure was required.\nTotal laparoscopic aneurysm resection can be offered to the majority of patients in our institution. The robot still requires further refinements to reduce operating times and the aortic cross-clamping period. We now have the technique and the instrumentation to offer laparoscopic aneurysm surgery as a minimally invasive alternative for patients whose conditions are unsuitable for endovascular aneurysm repair.",

For this purpose, the simple method of measuring Doppler ankle pressure with and without provocation was used preoperatively and postoperatively.\nDoppler ankle pressure was measured preoperatively and postoperatively in neutral position (n=32) and with provocation (forced plantar flexion of the foot; n=32) in 32 limbs in 23 patients with PAES (19 men, 4 women; average age, 38.24 +/- 12.25 years) operated on between January 1, 1986, and December 31, 2000. The reference method was angiography with provocation in 18 patients and duplex ultrasound scanning in 14 patients.\nPatients were assigned to one of two groups (A and B) on the basis of ankle-brachial index (ABI) at rest. Group A (mean age, 38.19 +/- 11.60 years) included all limbs (n=24) with ABI>0.9 preoperatively, and group B (mean age, 42.39 +/- 14.38 years) comprised all limbs (n=8) with ABI<0.9. Improvement in ABI under provocation after operation (group A, P<.0001; group B, P<.0004) was highly significant. In group B there was also a highly significant difference in ABI in the neutral position before and after operation (P=.0044); this could not be demonstrated in group A. Angiography or duplex sonography postoperatively did not provide any additional information.\nOur results indicate that determination of ABI alone, with and without provocation, is sufficient as a postoperative follow-up examination to appraise decompression and for quality assurance of PAES. Compared with other more elaborate instrumental methods, measurement of ABI is relatively noninvasive, quick and easy to carry out, effective, and inexpensive.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to define the long-term effects of renal revascularization on blood pressure, and renal and cardiac function in patients with Takayasu arteritis-induced renal artery stenosis (TARAS).\nTwenty-seven patients (25 women; mean age, 27 years) with TARAS underwent intervention. Primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency rates were determined, and the late effects on blood pressure, renal and cardiac function, and survival were analyzed.\nAll patients had hypertension (mean blood pressure, 167/99 mm Hg; 2.5 antihypertensive medications per patient). Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients not receiving hemodialysis was 76 mL/min, and in five patients serum creatinine concentration was greater than 1.5 mg/dL. Three patients were hemodialysis-dependent, and two had intractable congestive heart failure. Forty interventions were performed, including 32 aortorenal bypass procedures, two repeat implantations, four nephrectomies, and two transluminal angioplasty procedures. Postoperative morbidity was 19%. There were no deaths. During follow-up (mean, 68 months), three graft stenoses, all due to intimal hyperplasia, and three graft occlusions occurred. Two of three graft stenoses were successfully revised. At 1, 3, and 5 years of follow-up, primary patency was 87%, 79%, and 79%, respectively; primary assisted patency was 93%, 89%, 89%, respectively; and secondary patency was 93%, 89%, and 89%, respectively. Intervention resulted in a decrease in blood pressure to a mean of 132/79 mm Hg (P<.0001), and the need for antihypertensive medications was reduced to one per patient (P<.01). Mean glomerular filtration rate increased to 88 mL/min (P<.005), and two patients no longer required hemodialysis. Congestive heart failure resolved in both patients, and did not recur. There were three deaths during follow-up, with 5-year and 10-year actuarial survival of 96% and 80%, respectively.\nRenal revascularization to treat TARAS is durable, has a salutary effect on blood pressure, and enhances long-term renal and cardiac function. This response establishes renal revascularization as a successful and durable intervention for TARAS, and a benchmark to which other therapies should be compared.",

Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients not receiving hemodialysis was 76 mL/min, and in five patients serum creatinine concentration was greater than 1.5 mg/dL. Three patients were hemodialysis-dependent, and two had intractable congestive heart failure. Forty interventions were performed, including 32 aortorenal bypass procedures, two repeat implantations, four nephrectomies, and two transluminal angioplasty procedures. Postoperative morbidity was 19%. There were no deaths. During follow-up (mean, 68 months), three graft stenoses, all due to intimal hyperplasia, and three graft occlusions occurred. Two of three graft stenoses were successfully revised. At 1, 3, and 5 years of follow-up, primary patency was 87%, 79%, and 79%, respectively; primary assisted patency was 93%, 89%, 89%, respectively; and secondary patency was 93%, 89%, and 89%, respectively. Intervention resulted in a decrease in blood pressure to a mean of 132/79 mm Hg (P<.0001), and the need for antihypertensive medications was reduced to one per patient (P<.01). Mean glomerular filtration rate increased to 88 mL/min (P<.005), and two patients no longer required hemodialysis. Congestive heart failure resolved in both patients, and did not recur. There were three deaths during follow-up, with 5-year and 10-year actuarial survival of 96% and 80%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Laryngeal and tongue function was assessed in 28 patients to evaluate the presence, nature, and resolution of superior recurrent laryngeal and hypoglossal nerve damage resulting from standard open primary carotid endarterectomy (CEA).\nThe laryngeal and tongue function in 28 patients who underwent CEA were examined prospectively with various physiologic (Aerophone II, laryngograph, tongue transducer), acoustic (Multi-Dimensional Voice Program), and perceptual speech assessments. Measures were obtained from all participants preoperatively, and at 2 weeks and at 3 months postoperatively.\nThe perceptual speech assessment indicated that the vocal quality of \"roughness\" was significantly more apparent at the 2-week postoperative assessment than preoperatively. However, by the 3-month postoperative assessment these values had returned to near preoperative levels, with no significant difference detected between preoperative and 3-month postoperative levels or between 2-week and 3-month postoperative levels. Both the instrumental assessments of laryngeal function and the acoustic assessment of vocal quality failed to identify any significant difference on any measure across the three assessment periods. Similarly, no significant impairment in tongue strength, endurance, or rate of repetitive tongue movements was detected at instrumental assessment of tongue function.\nNo permanent changes to vocal or tongue function occurred in this group of participants after primary CEA. The lack of any significant long-term laryngeal or tongue dysfunction in this group suggests that the standard open CEA procedure is not associated with high rates of superior recurrent and hypoglossal nerve dysfunction, as previously believed.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate interobserver variability in the measurement of internal carotid artery (ICA) peak systolic velocity (PSV). We hypothesize that the reproducibility of repeated duplex scanning parameters, in the hands of very experienced vascular technologists in a laboratory accredited by the Intersocietal Commission for Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories, would be excellent.\nThirty-one patients underwent carotid duplex scanning by three vascular technologists using the same duplex scanning system. They examined patients with the laboratory's standard protocol. Statistical analysis of the sources of variation was carried out with two-way analysis of variance. The Altman-Bland method was used to detect bias and evaluate the interval of agreement between technologists for the ICA PSV on a continuous scale. The kappa statistic enabled measurement of agreement for ICA PSV on a categorical scale of stenosis (<50%, 50%-70%, >70%).\nPatient variability was responsible for 97.2% of the total variance, with only 0.58% (P<.005) attributed to the technologists. The level of agreement on a continuous scale between the measurements of ICA PSV by our technologists is wide. For individual patients it ranged from -25% to 43% between technologists A and B, -27% to 43% between technologists A and C, and -27% to 31% between technologists B and C. When we compared the three technologists, no systematic overestimation or underestimation of the ICA PSV was found (ie, no fixed bias). The level of agreement between the technologists did not depend on the value of the PSV (ie, no proportional bias). However, analysis of ICA PSV agreement on a categorical scale revealed almost perfect agreement (kappa>0.8).\nFrom measurements of PSV, the severity of carotid stenosis can be reproducibly categorized into ranges (<50%, 50%-70%, >70). However, the unacceptably wide interobserver variation of ICA PSV on a continuous scale makes the interchangeability of our technologists' measurements problematic for clinical use, as in determination of progression of severity of stenosis. When an ICA PSV measurement is in the vicinity of a cutoff value, the diagnostic accuracy may be improved with the use of additional diagnostic testing.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to study negative and positive arterial remodeling processes within self-expanding carotid stents, their interaction, and the resulting changes in hemodynamics over 2 years, with duplex ultrasound scanning.\nOne hundred twelve consecutive patients with 121 successfully stented carotid arteries were examined with color-coded duplex ultrasound scanning the day after the stent procedure and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up. The stent diameters at the proximal, middle, and distal regions, and the maximal neointimal thickness (B-mode) and hemodynamic parameters were recorded. Pre-interventional plaques were assigned to three types: soft, fibrous, and largely calcified.\nThe diameters of the self-expanding stents steadily increased over 2 years (positive arterial remodeling), from (mean +/- SD) 5.80 +/- 0.89 mm to 6.77 +/- 0.98 mm in the proximal stent area, from 3.51 +/- 0.76 mm to 4.92 +/- 0.89 mm in the middle stent area, and from 3.7 +/- 0.5 mm to 4.68 +/- 0.61 mm in the distal stent area (P<.001). Stent expansion was most marked in the middle stent area, depending on the type of pre-interventional plaque. The extent in stent expansion was more in soft than in fibrous and calcified plaques (P<.001). Neointimal thickness increased up to 12 months, and stabilized thereafter. The mean (+/- SD) neointimal thickness at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months was 0.61 +/- 0.28 mm, 0.97 +/- 0.39 mm, 1.06 +/- 0.36 mm, and 1.12 +/- 0.38 mm, respectively. These complex interactions resulted in the dominance of negative remodeling secondary to neointimal proliferation, with an increased flow ratio during the first year, from 1.16 +/- 0.37 at day 1 to 1.23 +/- 0.46 at 3 months, 1.67 +/- 1.37 at 6 months, and 1.57 +/- 0.70 at 12 months (P<.001), followed by a tendency to decrease as a result of stent expansion thereafter (flow ratio at 24 months, 1.49 +/- 0.70). Two of 121 stents (1.6%) had recurrent stenosis that required a secondary procedure.\nNeointimal proliferation or negative arterial remodeling prevails up to 12 months, and may give rise to rare stent recurrent stenosis. Stent expansion reduces this effect in the first year, and dominates in the second year. This might contribute to the good mid-term outcome of carotid stenting. Poor stent expansion in heavily calcified plaques calls for primary surgical management.",

    "abstract": "Improving health-related quality of life (HRQL) is the main goal of surgery to treat peripheral vascular disease (PVD); however, HRQL is rarely measured directly. Rather, most surgeons use other measures, such as patient symptoms and ankle-brachial index (ABI) to determine the need for intervention in PVD. The accuracy of these surrogates in representing HRQL has been untested. The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation of these measures with HRQL in patients undergoing evaluation for intervention in symptomatic PVD.\nPatients (n=108) referred to the vascular surgery service with symptoms of PVD were enrolled in a prospective study of HRQL. Patients completed two validated HRQL questionnaires: the short form-36 (SF-36) and the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ). All patients had symptoms consistent with PVD, including claudication (n=69; 63.9%), ischemic rest pain (n=17; 15.7%), or tissue loss (n=22; 20.4%). ABI was measured at presentation.\nThe mean ABI was 0.53 (range, 0.00-0.98). The maximal correlation between SF-36 score and ABI was reflected in the Physical Component Summary score (r=0.25). WIQ score also exhibited modest correlation with ABI, with maximal correlation noted for stair climbing (r=0.26). Both SF-36 and WIQ scores exhibited a highly significant association with symptoms. Patients with more severe symptoms, such as lifestyle-limiting claudication or limb-threatening ischemia, had lower HRQL scores compared with patients with non-lifestyle-limiting claudication. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that SF-36 and WIQ physical summary scores are better predicted by symptoms than by ABI (P<.01).\nHRQL in patients with PVD correlates weakly with ABI, but exhibits a closer association with vascular symptoms. However, neither variable fully expresses patient HRQL. These data suggest that sole reliance on these surrogates may not accurately reflect the effect of PVD on HRQL, or the potential benefit of vascular surgery in improving HRQL.",

    "abstract": "In an effort to explore alternatives to contrast material-enhanced arteriography, we compared magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and duplex arteriography (DA) with contrast arteriography (CA) for defining anatomic features in patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization.\nFrom August 1, 2001, to August 1, 2002, 61 consecutive inpatients (64 limbs) with chronic lower extremity ischemia underwent CA, MRA, and DA before undergoing lower extremity revascularization procedures. The reports of these tests and images were compared prospectively, and the differences in the iliac, femoropopliteal, and infrapopliteal segments were noted. The vessels were classified as mildly diseased (<50%), moderately diseased (50%-70%), severely diseased (71%-99%), or occluded. The studies and treatment plans based on these data were compared.\nMean patient age was 76 +/- 10 years (SD). Indications for the procedures included gangrene (43%), ischemic ulcer (28%), rest pain (19%), severe claudication (9%), and failing bypass (1%). During this period 35 patients were ineligible for the protocol, because they could not undergo MRA (n=27) or angiography (n=8). Of the total 192 segments in the 64 patients (iliac, femoropopliteal, tibial), 17% were not able to be fully assessed with DA, and 7% with MRA. Disagreements with CA and DA were found in the iliac, femoropopliteal, and tibial segments in 0%, 7%, and 14% of cases, respectively, and between CA and MRA in 10%, 26%, and 42% of cases, respectively. Two of 9 differences (22%) between DA and CA were thought to be clinically significant, and 28 of 45 differences (62%) between MRA and CA were thought to be clinically significant.\nA review of the data obtained in this series indicates that MRA does not yet seem to yield adequate data, at least in this highly selected population at our institution. When severe calcification is identified, CA may be necessary in patients undergoing DA.",

Indications for the procedures included gangrene (43%), ischemic ulcer (28%), rest pain (19%), severe claudication (9%), and failing bypass (1%). During this period 35 patients were ineligible for the protocol, because they could not undergo MRA (n=27) or angiography (n=8). Of the total 192 segments in the 64 patients (iliac, femoropopliteal, tibial), 17% were not able to be fully assessed with DA, and 7% with MRA. Disagreements with CA and DA were found in the iliac, femoropopliteal, and tibial segments in 0%, 7%, and 14% of cases, respectively, and between CA and MRA in 10%, 26%, and 42% of cases, respectively. Two of 9 differences (22%) between DA and CA were thought to be clinically significant, and 28 of 45 differences (62%) between MRA and CA were thought to be clinically significant.",

    "abstract": "Limb loss after lower extremity surgical revascularization occurs relatively frequently in patients receiving dialysis. The goal of the present study was to determine whether patients with milder degrees of renal insufficiency are also at risk for this complication.\nThis cohort study was carried out at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The study sample consisted of 9932 patients undergoing an initial surgical revascularization procedure between October 1, 1995, and September 30, 2000, recorded by the VA National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). We examined the occurrence of major amputation within 1 year of lower extremity surgical revascularization by level of renal function.\nEleven percent of study patients underwent major lower extremity amputation within 1 year of NSQIP-documented lower extremity revascularization surgery: 10% (739 of 7335) of patients with normal renal function, 11% (251 of 2210) of patients with moderately reduced renal function, 12% (24 of 205) of patients with severe renal insufficiency, and 29% (53 of 182) of patients receiving dialysis. After adjustment for demographic characteristics and comorbid conditions, only patients receiving dialysis were at significantly increased risk for amputation, compared with patients with normal renal function (odds ratio, 2.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.74-3.47; P<.001). Compared with all other veterans undergoing bypass procedures, patients receiving dialysis were more likely to have a wound infection; a diagnostic code for lower extremity gangrene, infection, or ischemic ulceration; an elevated white blood cell count; and preoperative sepsis at the time of initial revascularization. In addition, they were more likely to have a preoperative hospital stay longer than 1 week, undergo concurrent minor amputation, and undergo an outflow (vs inflow) procedure.\nOnly patients receiving dialysis, and not patients with milder degrees of renal insufficiency, appear to be at higher risk for limb loss after revascularization, compared with patients with normal renal function. Further studies are needed to determine why patients receiving dialysis are at a singularly increased risk for limb loss after lower extremity revascularization and whether their more frequent presentation with limb-threatening infection at the time of revascularization reflects late presentation for surgery or a more rapid course of peripheral arterial disease in this patient group.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent stenotic lesions associated with vein graft bypass grafts are often fibrous and smooth. Unlike de novo atherosclerotic lesions, they respond poorly to balloon angioplasty, and may often result in a dissection requiring stent placement to avoid early recurrent thrombosis or open repair of residual stenosis. A novel balloon designed with three or four longitudinally placed 0.127-mm atherotomes was used at angioplasty to treat focal peripheral vein graft stenosis, in an attempt to minimize dissection by producing a controlled plaque fracture.\nOver 11 months, patients with focal (<2 cm) peripheral vein graft stenosis underwent cutting balloon angioplasty (Boston Scientific, San Diego, Calif) at two separate centers. Baseline patient demographic data, type of bypass, velocity at pre-procedural and post-procedural duplex scanning, procedural results, complications, and type of long-term anticoagulation were recorded. Follow-up consisted of duplex ultrasound scanning at 1, 3, and 6 months and every 6 months for 2 years.\nThe mean age of the patients was 66.8 +/- 10 years. No intent to treat failure was noted. In most patients a 4-mm balloon was used (15 of 19) to treat 10 above-knee vein bypass grafts and 9 below-knee vein bypass grafts. No patient required placement of a stent or conversion to open surgery because of recoil, dissection, or suboptimal angioplasty. The mean velocity at pre-procedure duplex scanning at the site of vein graft stenosis was 373 +/- 56.8 cm/s, and the mean velocity post-treatment at 1-month follow-up was 144 +/- 50 cm/s. The mean length of stay was 26 +/- 32 hours. Overall, four patients continued to receive warfarin anticoagulation therapy, in addition to aspirin. During a mean follow-up of 11.4 +/- 7 months, recurrent stenosis developed in one patient. No other complications or graft recurrent thrombosis was noted.\nCutting balloon angioplasty may help overcome hoop stress early, by producing a controlled, longitudinal neointimal lesion laceration and thereby facilitating a fracture line along predetermined microincisions. Our study results demonstrate acceptable early outcomes, with no requirement for bail-out stenting or open surgery.",

Presentation with intra-abdominal hemorrhage is associated with a high mortality rate. We describe life-saving transcatheter coil embolization of multiple isolated ruptured hepatic pseudoaneurysms in a patient with no history or clinical findings of PAN. We present angiographic findings and intra-arterial transcatheter embolization techniques in the treatment of ruptured large hepatic artery aneurysms. Endovascular specialists should recognize that PAN could present with classic angiographic findings and, in some cases, as life-threatening ruptured isolated hepatic artery aneurysms as its first presentation.",

Neutrophils have been implicated in RAAA repair-induced organ injury; however, the agents responsible for neutrophil activation and organ sequestration have not been identified. This study investigated the role of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) in organ injury in an RAAA model.\nRats were subjected to 1 hour of hemorrhagic shock with resuscitation, followed by 45 minutes of lower torso ischemia and 2 hours of reperfusion, and randomly were selected to receive saline solution or anti-rat CINC monoclonal antibody at the start of hemorrhagic shock. Another group of animals underwent sham operation, and served as a control group. Intestinal and lung permeability, intestinal and lung myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, intestinal and lung CINC, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels, resuscitation fluid requirements, and histologic mucosal injury were evaluated in all groups.\nThe RAAA model resulted in increased lung and intestinal permeability to radiolabeled albumin and lung MPO activity (P <.01), with increases in intestinal TNF-alpha (P <.001) and CINC (P <.01) levels, when compared with sham-operated animals. Treatment with anti-rat CINC monoclonal antibody attenuated the increases in intestinal permeability and histologic mucosal injury (P <.01), gut TNF-alpha level (P <.001), and resuscitation fluid volume required (P <.05), without significantly affecting lung and intestinal MPO activity, lung permeability, and intestinal CINC level (P = NS), compared with animals given saline solution.\nNeutralization of CINC by the anti-rat CINC monoclonal antibody attenuated intestinal injury and induction of intestinal TNF-alpha, but failed to significantly attenuate remote pulmonary injury in this model of RAAA.",

    "abstract": "Migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) into the subintimal space, and their proliferation and resultant deposition of extracellular matrix are key processes in the development of intimal hyperplasia, leading to vascular recurrent stenosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of clinically administered doses of gamma-radiation on SMCs and extracellular matrix proteins in vitro, to better understand how it impinges on cellular and extracellular components of recurrent stenosis.\nThe effects of gamma-irradiation (10, 20 Gy) on SMC migration into three-dimensional collagen matrix gels was quantitated by calibrated light microscopy, and the release of metalloproteinases into conditioned media was investigated with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and zymography. Collagen production was assayed with [(3)H]-proline incorporation, and SMC phenotype changes with confocal microscopy with a fluorescent alpha-actin antibody. The effect of gamma-irradiation on extracellular matrix was investigated by quantitating untreated SMC proliferation ((3)H-thymidine incorporation) on irradiated endothelial cell-derived matrix and by assessing structural collagen matrix changes with sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All groups were compared with nonirradiated control groups.\nSMC vertical migration was significantly decreased by gamma-irradiation (48% and 55%, respectively; P <.0001). Irradiation did not generate measurable matrix protein crosslinks, nor did it alter the production of metalloproteinases or collagen synthesis. However, gamma-irradiation decreased the ability of extracellular matrix to induce nonirradiated SMC proliferation (15% reduction; P =.0028). Moreover, gamma-irradiation reversed the secretory phenotype of cultured SMCs to a contractile type.\nThe gamma-irradiation-induced reduction of cellular migration, changes in SMC phenotype, and functional activity of matrix-bound factors, and no measurable effects on the production of extracellular matrix proteins, may in part explain the diverse effects of gamma-irradiation on the restenotic response.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration from the media into the intima is pivotal for intimal formation after vascular injury. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB is a potent chemoattractant for SMCs in vitro and in vivo. We investigated whether interleukin (IL)-1beta affects migration in response to PDGF-BB. Our data suggest that IL-1beta is inhibitory and that this effect is mediated by cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. We further addressed the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38, which is activated by PDGF-BB and by IL-1beta.\nBaboon aortic SMCs were prepared with the explant method. Migration was measured in a Boyden chamber assay through filters coated with monomeric collagen. COX2 expression and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK were analyzed by Western blotting.\nPDGF-BB (10 ng/mL) stimulates migration 3.8-fold, and IL-1beta (0.1 ng/mL) reduces this response by 40%. The inhibitory effect of IL-1beta is abolished by the COX inhibitor, indomethacin (10 micromol/L), the specific COX2 inhibitor, NS398 (10 micromol/L), and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (3 micromol/L). We found that IL-1beta and PDGF-BB synergize to stimulate COX2 expression. We further demonstrated that p38 MAPK is activated by IL-1beta and PDGF with different kinetics and that p38 MAPK is required for maximal COX2 expression in response to IL-1beta plus PDGF-BB.\nIL-1beta inhibits PDGF-BB-induced migration by cooperating with PDGF-BB to induce COX2 through activation of p38 MAPK. Whether this effect of IL-1beta modulates intimal growth after vascular injury remains to be elucidated.",

The current study examined the role of the gelatinases in flow-mediated vein graft intimal hyperplasia. We hypothesized that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expression and protein levels, relative to tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2, are upregulated in a flow-dependent manner during vein graft arterialization.\nBilateral common carotid interposition vein grafting was performed in rabbits. Reduction in flow was achieved through unilateral ligation of the internal carotid artery and three of four branches of the external carotid artery. At 28 days grafts were harvested and analyzed for intimal area; MMP-2 and MMP-9, and TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 messenger RNA content, via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; and MMP-2 and MMP-9, and TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 protein concentrations, via both bioactivity assay and zymography.\nBranch ligation resulted in a 10-fold difference in mean flow rate and accelerated development of intimal hyperplasia in a low-flow environment. Exposure of the vein graft to arterial hemodynamics induced a marked rise in MMP-9 mRNA levels, whereas only a modest increase in MMP-2 mRNA was observed. MMP-2 protein was 50 to 100 times more abundant than MMP-9, and was significantly upregulated in grafts that demonstrated enhanced intimal thickening. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that MMP-2 was located throughout the myointima, whereas MMP-9 was localized almost exclusively to the region of endothelium. No differences in TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 mRNA or protein levels were detected between high-flow and low-flow grafts.\nMMP-2 is the predominate gelatinase that regulates early vein graft remodeling. Despite a marked increase in MMP-9 gene expression, development of intimal hyperplasia after a reduction in wall shear rate correlates with an increase in MMP-2 protein levels. These data suggest differential regulatory mechanisms for proteases within the remodeling vein graft wall. Modulation of extracellular matrix biologic features may offer therapeutic strategies for the prevention of vein graft failure.",

We have demonstrated that recombinant human thrombomodulin (rTM) inhibits thrombin-induced arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation in vitro. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of rTM on neointimal hyperplasia in vivo.\nA rabbit femoral artery balloon injury model was used. Bilateral superficial femoral arteries were deendothelialized with a 2F arterial embolectomy catheter. rTM (145 microg/kg; 2.0 microg/mL in circulation) or Tris-hydrochloride vehicle control was administered intravenously during the procedure, then either discontinued (group A) or administered twice daily for an additional 48 hours (group B). Rabbits were euthanized at 4 days and at 1, 2, and 4 weeks, and femoral artery specimens were prepared with in situ perfusion fixation and paraffin embedding. Luminal, intima, media, and whole artery areas were quantitated with digital imaging computerized planimetry. Intima-media and lumen-whole artery ratios were calculated. The injury-induced inflammatory reaction was also evaluated with light microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical and immunohistofluorescence staining.\nIn the buffer control group, neointimal hyperplasia after femoral artery balloon injury was evident at 2 weeks, and was pronounced at 4 weeks (P <.0001). Infusion of rTM significantly inhibited intimal hyperplasia at both 2 and 4 weeks (P <.0001). In group A, rTM reduced the intima-media ratio by 27% and 39% at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. Extended administration of rTM (group B) resulted in inhibition of hyperplasia by 57% and 30% at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, but failed to reach significance compared with the shorter exposure. rTM infusion significantly inhibited thrombosis (8.1-fold) compared with the buffer control group (P =.012). rTM had no significant effect on lumen area or lumen-whole artery ratio, but treated arteries demonstrated significantly less compensatory dilatation (P =.045), as measured by whole artery area in response to less intimal hyperplasia. rTM administration inhibited platelet adhesion and inhibition of neutrophil infiltration to a degree that approached statistical significance (P =.0675).\nSystemic intravenous administration of rTM significantly decreases neointimal hyperplasia and improves patency in the rabbit femoral artery after balloon injury. In addition to exhibiting antithrombotic and antiproliferative effects, rTM may also invoke an anti-inflammatory mechanism, and may alter vascular remodeling in a multidimensional role to inhibit recurrent stenosis after arterial injury.",

These cells were then suffused into a novel dual-layered Dacron graft and cultured for 36 to 48 hours. The grafts were mounted on a Palmaz stent and balloon- expanded in the infrarenal aorta of the SMC donor dogs (n = 6). Grafts were recovered at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 months. A control endograft suffused with SMCs transduced with only the beta-galactosidase gene was placed in the dogs with grafts recovered at 2, 3, and 4 months. t-PA antigen concentration and expression were analyzed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nRetained engineered SMCs (blue nuclei) were identified in the explanted grafts, neointima, and underlying aorta with X-gal staining.

    "abstract": "Our purpose was to improve the performance of carbon-coated expanded polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts by bonding the grafts with silyl-heparin, a biologically active heparin analog, using polyethylene glycol as a cross-linking agent. Material and method Silyl-heparin-bonded carbon-coated expanded polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts (Bard Peripheral Vascular, Tempe, Ariz), were evaluated for patency and platelet deposition 2 hours, 7 days, and 30 days after graft implantation in a canine bilateral aortoiliac artery model. Platelet deposition was determined by injection of autologous, (111)Indium-radiolabeled platelets, followed by a 2-hour circulation period prior to graft explantation. Histologic studies were performed on a 2-mm longitudinal strip of each graft (7-day and 30-day groups). Heparin activity of the explanted silyl-heparin grafts was determined by using an antithrombin-III based thrombin binding assay.\nOverall chronic graft patency (7-day and 30-day groups) was 100% for the silyl-heparin bonded (16/16) grafts versus 68.75% for control (11/16) grafts (P =.043). Acute 2-hour graft patency was 100% for the silyl-heparin bonded (6/6) grafts versus 83.3% for control (5/6) grafts. Radiolabeled platelet deposition studies revealed a significantly lower amount of platelets deposited on the silyl-heparin grafts as compared with control grafts in the 30-day group (13.8 +/- 7.18 vs 28.4 +/- 9.73, CPM per cm2 per million platelets, mean +/- SD, P =.0451, Wilcoxon rank sum test). In the 2-hour group of dogs, a trend towards a lower deposition of platelets on the silyl-heparin grafts was observed. There was no significant difference in platelet deposition between the two grafts in the 7-day group. Histologic studies revealed a significant reduction in intraluminal graft thrombus present on the silyl-heparin grafts as compared with control grafts in the 30-day group of animals. In contrast, there was no difference in amount of graft thrombus present on both graft types in the 7-day group of dogs. Pre-implant heparin activity on the silyl-heparin bonded grafts was 2.0 IU/cm(2) (international units[IU]/cm(2)).

    "abstract": "We recently identified small saphenous vein (SSV) reflux as a significant risk factor for ulcer recurrence in patients with severe chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) undergoing perforator vein ligation. In this study we examined the role of SSV reflux in patients across the spectrum of CVI.\nFrom March 15, 1997, to December 24, 2002, clinical and duplex ultrasound (US) scanning data from all valve closure time studies performed in our vascular laboratory were prospectively recorded. Valve closure time in the deep and superficial leg veins was assessed with the rapid cuff deflation technique; reflux time greater than 0.5 seconds was considered abnormal. SSV reflux was correlated with the CEAP classification system and eventual surgical procedure. Data were analyzed with Pearson chi(2) analysis.\nWe analyzed 722 limbs in 422 patients, 265 (63%) female patients and 157 (37%) male patients, with a mean age of 48 +/- 12.8 years (range, 16-85 years). In the entire cohort the cause was congenital (Ec) in 5 patients, primary (Ep) in 606 patients, and secondary (Es) in 112 patients. SSV reflux was present in 206 limbs (28.5%) evaluated. Among limbs with SSV reflux, Ec = 4 (2%), Ep = 162 (79%), and Es = 40 (19%). SSV reflux did not correlate with gender, side, or age. The prevalence of SSV reflux increases with increasing severity of clinical class: C1-C3, 25.8% versus C4-C6, 36.1% (P =.006). SSV reflux is highly associated with deep venous reflux, 35.2% of femoral vein reflux (P =.015), 35.8% of femoral vein plus popliteal vein reflux (P =.001), and 40.5% of isolated popliteal vein reflux (P <.001). Great saphenous vein (GSV) reflux was identified in 483 (67%) limbs studied with valve closure time, whereas SSV reflux was present in 206 (28%) limbs.

Among limbs with SSV reflux, Ec = 4 (2%), Ep = 162 (79%), and Es = 40 (19%). SSV reflux did not correlate with gender, side, or age. The prevalence of SSV reflux increases with increasing severity of clinical class: C1-C3, 25.8% versus C4-C6, 36.1% (P =.006). SSV reflux is highly associated with deep venous reflux, 35.2% of femoral vein reflux (P =.015), 35.8% of femoral vein plus popliteal vein reflux (P =.001), and 40.5% of isolated popliteal vein reflux (P <.001).

    "abstract": "Partial obstruction of postthrombotic veins is caused by endovenous scar tissue, which creates synechiae and septae that narrow and sometimes block the lumen. We have performed surgical disobliteration, or endophlebectomy, of chronically obstructed venous segments during various kinds of deep venous reconstructions to increase the flow through previously obstructed segments. In this article we describe the endophlebectomy technique, and report the availability of this procedure as an adjunct to deep venous reconstructions for the treatment of postthrombotic chronic venous insufficiency. Patients and methods Between July 1996 and February 2003, surgical disobstruction of 23 deep venous segments was performed in 13 patients in association with 14 deep venous reconstructions to treat advanced postthrombotic chronic venous insufficiency. Postthrombotic veins were surgically exposed, and a longitudinal venotomy was carried out at a variable length. The synechiae and masses attached to the intimal layer were carefully excised. Mean duplex scanning follow-up was 10.8 +/- 8.2 months (median, 8 months; range, 1-28 months).\nIn 10 patients (77%) the treated segments remained primarily patent at median follow-up of 8 months (range, 1-28 months). Early thrombosis near the endophlebectomy site occurred in 3 patients, at 2, 5, and 12 days, respectively, after surgery. In 2 patients with early thrombosis further interventions were carried out with success. In a third patient with early postoperative thrombosis the final outcome was recanalization and reflux. These results yielded an overall secondary patency rate of 93%. No perioperative pulmonary embolism was observed.\nThis series demonstrates that surgical disobliteration of postthrombotic deep veins is technically feasible, and led to patency of the segments for the duration of follow-up for up to 28 months (mean, 10.8 +/- 8.2 months). We used this technique with the objective of disobstructing postthrombotic veins, to increase flow through a previously narrowed lumen. Postoperative thrombosis at the site of endophlebectomy occurred in 23% of patients. Although this early experience is encouraging, further studies and longer follow-up are necessary to assess the durability of the procedure.",

    "abstract": "The primary use of autogenous arteriovenous access for chronic hemodialysis is recommended by the National Kidney Foundation-Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative practice guidelines. We review the outcomes of basilic vein transposition (BVT) to assess its value as a primary upper arm arteriovenous access option.\nA retrospective review of 56 patients undergoing BVT was performed. Thirty patients were men; average age was 56 years. Etiology of end-stage renal disease, complications, and time to maturation were tabulated. Primary and secondary patency rates were determined by using life table methods. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to assess risk factors for fistula failure.\nRenal failure was associated with diabetes in 32 (57%) patients, and BVT was the primary access procedure in 22 (39%) patients. Perioperative complications occurred in 5 (9%) patients and included hematoma (n = 3), myocardial infarction (n = 1), and death (n = 1). The average time to maturation was 74 days (range, 12-265 days), and maturation failure occurred in 21 (38%) patients. Logistic regression analysis showed that age older than 60 years was associated with poorer maturation and patency rates. On an intent-to-treat basis, 1-year primary and secondary patencies were 35% and 47%, respectively, but only 18% and 28%, respectively, for age >60 years. Forty-two percent of failed BVT were subsequently replaced with a prosthetic graft by using the same upper arm vessels.\nBVT frequently do not mature in patients older than 60 years, which compromises its utility as a primary access. However, fistulas that mature provide acceptable patency rates, and subsequent conversion to a prosthetic access is frequently possible. Selective use of BVT might improve the utilization of available access sites.",

    "abstract": "We undertook this study to determine whether changes in blood coagulability associated with peripheral arterial occlusive disease are due to contact with the atherosclerotic arterial wall or passage through distal ischemic tissue.\nThirty patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease undergoing angiography participated in the study. Ankle-brachial pressure index was recorded before intervention. Blood samples taken from the aorta, common femoral artery, and common femoral vein were analyzed at thromboelastography. Angiograms were scored for stenotic disease by a radiologist blinded to the other results.\nWhen femoral artery samples were compared with aortic samples there was a decrease in reaction time (R; P <.05), an increase in maximum amplitude (MA; P <.05), and an increase in coagulation index (CI; P <.002), indicating an increase in coagulability as blood flowed down the iliac segment. These changes also correlated (DeltaR, r = 0.442, P <.05; DeltaMA, r = 0.379, P <.05; DeltaCI, r = 0.429, P <.05) with the severity of disease in the ipsilateral iliac segment. Significant differences in R (P <.05), angle (P <.05), MA (P <.005), and CI (P <.001) between common femoral arterial and venous samples confirmed that venous samples were more coagulable in this group of patients. This difference in Thromboelastography parameters across the arteriovenous segment correlated inversely with the degree of ischemia (represented by ankle-brachial pressure index; DeltaCI, r = -0.427, P <.05; DeltaMA, r = -0.370, P <.05) in the puncture side limb.\nPassage of blood down an atherosclerotic artery leads to an increase in coagulability proportional to the degree of stenosis in that vessel. Passage of blood through ischemic tissue may also contribute to increased coagulability in peripheral arterial occlusive disease.",

    "abstract": "There is continuing controversy as to whether surgical bypass or angioplasty should be first-line treatment of severe limb ischemia. We undertook this study to examine angiographic and clinical factors that influence the treatment of severe limb ischemia by vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists.\nTwenty consultant vascular surgeons and 17 consultant vascular interventional radiologists evaluated 596 hypothetical clinical or angiographic scenarios, and recorded whether, in their opinion, the most appropriate first-line treatment was surgical bypass, angioplasty, or primary amputation. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to identify the factors that significantly affected responses from the entire group and from surgeons and radiologists separately.\nThere were significant differences between surgeons and radiologists with regard to how clinical and angiographic variables determined treatment preferences. Increasing disease severity, absence of runoff into the foot, presence of a suitable vein, and tissue loss as opposed to rest pain only (the latter only significant to surgeons) all increased the response score toward surgery. However, surgeons and radiologists weighted each of these factors quite differently. Even in the most complex statistical model, 19% of surgical and 13% of radiologic response variations remained unexplained.\nIndividual surgeons and radiologists vary considerably in their views of the relative merits of surgery and angioplasty in patients with severe limb ischemia.

    "abstract": "The National Audit of Thrombolysis for Acute Leg Ischemia (NATALI) database is a consecutive series of patients who underwent intra-arterial thrombolysis to treat acute leg ischemia in one of 11 centers in the United Kingdom. The purpose of the study was to analyze the factors associated with outcome after 30 days.\nThe data were collected over 10 years on standard pro formas, and registration was completed at the end of 1999. Since then, data from each unit have been verified and missing data included when available. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, with the outcomes of amputation-free survival (AFS), amputation with survival, and death.\nA total of 1133 thrombolytic events were included. Outcome results at 30 days for the entire group were AFS, 852 (75.2%); amputation, 141 (12.4%); and death, 140 (12.4%). Results for the entire group improved from the first half of the database, when AFS ranged from 65% to 75%, to almost 80% for the last few years of the study, although this was not statistically significant. Preintervention factors associated with lower AFS at multivariate analysis included diabetes (P =.002), increasing age (P <.001), short-duration ischemia (P =.027), Fontaine grade (P =.001), and ischemia with neurosensory deficit (P =.004). AFS was improved in patients receiving warfarin sodium at the time of the arterial occlusion (P =.04). Mortality was higher in women (P =.006) and in older patients (P <.001), and in patients with native vessel occlusion (P <.001), emboli (P =.02), or a history of ischemic heart disease (P <.001). Amputation risk was greatest in younger men (P <.001) and in patients with more severe ischemia (P =.02), graft occlusion (P <.001), or native vessel thrombotic occlusion (P =.02).\nExperienced surgeons and radiologists can achieve an AFS of about 80% in selected patients with acute leg ischemia. Information from the NATALI database can be used in selection of an appropriate intervention in the individual patient.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated early and late results of allograft replacement to treat infrarenal aortic graft infection in a large number of patients and compared the results in patients who received fresh allografts versus patients who received cryopreserved allografts.\nFrom 1988 to 2002 we operated on 179 consecutive patients (mean age, 64.6 +/- 9.0 years; 88.8% men). One hundred twenty-five patients (69.8%) had primary graft infections, and 54 patients (30.2%) had secondary aortoenteric fistulas (AEFs). Fresh allografts were used in 111 patients (62.0%) until 1996, and cryopreserved allografts were used in 68 patients (38.0%) thereafter.\nEarly postoperative mortality was 20.1% (36 patients), including four (2.2%) allograft-related deaths from rupture of the allograft (recurrent AEF, n = 3), all in patients with fresh allografts. Thirty-two deaths were not allograft related. Significant risk factors for early mortality were septic shock (P <.001), presence of AEF (P =.04), emergency operation (P =.003), emergency allograft replacement (P =.0075), surgical complication (P =.003) or medical complication (P <.0001), and need for repeat operation (P =.04). There were five (2.8%) nonlethal allograft complications (rupture, n = 2; thromboses, which were successfully treated at repeat operation, n = 2; and amputation, n = 1), all in patients with fresh allografts. Four patients (2.2%) were lost to follow-up. Mean follow-up was 46.0 +/- 42.1 months (range, 1-148 months). Late mortality was 25.9% (37 patients). There were three (2.1%) allograft-related late deaths from rupture of the allograft, at 9, 10, and 27 months, respectively, all in patients with fresh allografts. Actuarial survival was 73.2% +/- 6.8% at 1 year, 55.0% +/- 8.8% at 5 years, and 49.4% +/- 9.6% at 7 years. Late nonlethal aortic events occurred in 10 patients (7.2%; occlusion, n = 4; dilatation < 4 cm, n = 5; aneurysm, n = 1), at a mean of 28.3 +/- 28.2 months, all but two in patients with fresh allografts. The only significant risk factor for late aortic events was use of an allograft obtained from the descending thoracic aorta (P =.03). Actuarial freedom from late aortic events was 96.6% +/- 3.4% at 1 year, 89.3% +/- 6.6% at 3 years, and 89.3% +/- 6.6% at 5 years. There were 63 late, mostly occlusive, iliofemoral events, which occurred at a mean of 34.9 +/- 33.7 months in 38 patients (26.6%), 28 of whom (73.7%) had received fresh allografts. The only significant risk factor for late iliofemoral events was use of fresh allografts versus cryopreserved allografts (P =.03). Actuarial freedom from late iliofemoral events was 84.6% +/- 7.0% at 1 year, 72.5% +/- 9.0% at 3 years, and 66.4% +/- 10.2% at 5 years.\nEarly and long-term results of allograft replacement are at least similar to those of other methods to manage infrarenal aortic graft infections. Rare specific complications include early or late allograft rupture and late aortic dilatation. The more frequent late iliofemoral complications may be easily managed through the groin. These complications are significantly reduced by using cryopreserved allografts rather than fresh allografts and by not using allografts obtained from the descending thoracic aorta.",

    "abstract": "Carotid angioplasty and stenting has been proposed as a treatment option for carotid occlusive disease in patients at high risk, including those 80 years of age or older or with contralateral carotid occlusion. We analyzed 30-day mortality and stroke risk rates of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients aged 80 years or older with concurrent carotid occlusive disease.\nFrom a retrospective review of 1000 patients undergoing 1150 CEA procedures to treat symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid lesions over 13 years, we identified 54 patients (5.4%) aged 80 years or older with concurrent contralateral carotid occlusion. These patients were compared with 38 patients (3.8%) aged 80 years or older with normal or diseased patent contralateral carotid artery and 81 patients (8.1%) younger than 80 years with contralateral carotid occlusion. All CEA procedures involved either standard CEA with patching or eversion CEA, and were performed by the same surgeon, with the patients under deep general anesthesia and cerebral protection involving continuous perioperative electroencephalographic monitoring for selective shunting. Shunting criteria were based exclusively on electroencephalographic abnormalities consistent with cerebral ischemia.\nThe 30-day mortality and stroke rate in patients aged 80 years or older with concurrent contralateral carotid occlusion was zero.\nThe concept of high-risk CEA needs to be revisited. Patients with two of the criteria considered high risk in the medical literature, that is, age 80 years or older and contralateral carotid occlusion, can undergo CEA with no greater risks or complications. Until prospective randomized trials designed to evaluate the role of carotid angioplasty and stenting have been completed, CEA should remain the standard treatment in such patients.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and demonstrate the advantages of a new technique for carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) with proximal cerebral protection through a direct transcervical approach, as compared with a percutaneous transfemoral approach.\nCAS procedures were carried out in 25 consecutive patients, 4 with the femoral approach and 21 through a 2-cm incision at the base of the neck, with the patient under local anesthesia. For transcervical occlusion and protective shunting (TOPS), a short 9F sheath was inserted directly into the common carotid artery and connected to a 6F sheath placed percutaneously in the ipsilateral internal jugular vein. After clamping the common carotid artery proximal to the 9F sheath, internal carotid artery blood flow reversal was confirmed or an occluding external carotid balloon was placed. A filter interposed between the arterial and venous sheaths collected embolic debris from transcarotid manipulations. The arterial puncture was directly repaired with suture. Neurologic status was assessed with the National Institutes of Health stroke scale by an independent neurology consultant before and after the procedure.\nOne of the four percutaneous femoral approaches that failed because of tortuous anatomy was successfully treated with TOPS. Angiographic confirmation demonstrating resolution of asymptomatic (>80%; n = 12) stenosis or symptomatic (>60%; n = 12) stenosis was achieved in all patients with stents. A 0% technical failure rate and 0% combined 30-day stroke or mortality rate were achieved in all CAS attempted with TOPS. There were no hematomas in the cervical group, despite pretreatment with clopidogrel bisulfate and heparin, and one hematoma in the femoral group after failure of a Perclose arterial closure device. In one of the patients in the femoral group bilateral cholesterol emboli to the toes developed.\nTOPS solves problems of access, embolization into the cerebral and peripheral circulation, and specialized cerebral protection devices, and enables secure closure of the access vessel in patients given anticoagulation therapy. TOPS may provide a safer, more effective, economical means for performing CAS.",

    "abstract": "Overviews of randomized patch trials by the Cochrane Collaboration suggest that a policy of routine patching is preferable to routine primary closure. However, there is no systematic evidence that patch type, whether prosthetic or vein, influences outcome after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).\nTwo hundred seventy-three patients were randomized to vein or thin-walled Dacron patch (Hemashield Finesse) closure of the arteriotomy after 276 CEA procedures. Patients were reviewed clinically and with duplex ultrasound scanning at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months or until death. No patients were lost to follow-up. Cumulative statistical analyses are presented for the 264 patients (269 CEAs) who actually received a randomized treatment allocation.\nCumulative freedom from death or ipsilateral stroke at 3 years (including operative events) was 93.0% in the Dacron patch group and 95.5% in the vein group P =.42). Cumulative freedom from death or any stroke was 91.5% after Dacron patch closure and 93.9% after vein closure (P =.46). Cumulative freedom from recurrent stenosis greater than 70% or occlusion at 3 years was 92.9% for patients randomized to the Dacron patch group and 98.4% for patients randomized to the vein group (P =.03). At 3 years the incidence of stroke in the carotid territory not operated on was 1.0% in 93 patients with no contralateral internal carotid artery disease at randomization, and increased to 1.3% in 78 patients with 1% to 69% stenosis, and 2.0% in 51 patients with contralateral 70% to 99% stenosis. No late strokes occurred distal to 42 occluded contralateral internal carotid arteries.\nPatch type has no influence on early operative risk, no association with enhanced patterns of thrombogenicity in the early postoperative period, and no influence on risk for ipsilateral or any stroke at 3 years. Dacron patches were, however, associated with a significantly higher incidence of recurrent stenosis at 3 years, with most occurring within 6 to 12 months of surgery. However, the higher incidence of recurrent stenosis was not associated with a parallel increase in late stroke, and in this study a program of serial ultrasound surveillance could not have prevented one ipsilateral stroke.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) on the rate of occlusion and bleeding during peripheral vascular surgery.\nThe study was an open label, prospective, randomized trial, carried out by 20 Swedish surgical and vascular surgical departments that report to the Swedish Vascular Registry (SWEDVASC). Study subjects included patients undergoing peripheral vascular procedures, except carotid surgery. Of the 849 patients included, 817 were followed up to 30 days. LMWH (40 mg of enoxaparin) or UFH (5000 IU heparin) was given intravenously immediately before clamping. The same formulation in diluted form was used for vascular rinsing. Main outcome measures included patent reconstruction at day 1, perioperative blood loss, and the percentage of patients requiring protamin. Further, 30-day data for mortality, repeat operation, and recurrent occlusion are reported.\nThe mortality rate at 30 days was 2.7%, with no difference between groups. The patency rate at 1 day was 91.2% to 98.4%, depending on diagnosis and type of reconstruction. No difference was recorded between study groups (0.6 < P < 1.0). At 30 days the patency rate was 83.1% to 100% (0.2 < P <.9). Median blood loss was 350 mL (interquartile range [IQR], 200-800 mL) in the LMWH group and 425 mL (IQR, 200-900 mL) in the UFH group (P =.02). Protamin was given to significantly fewer patients in the LMWH group (P =.001).

    "abstract": "This prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was performed to analyze the effect of atorvastatin compared with placebo on the occurrence of a 6-month composite of cardiovascular events after vascular surgery. Cardiovascular complications are the most important cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality among patients undergoing vascular surgery. Statin therapy may reduce perioperative cardiac events through stabilization of coronary plaques.\nOne hundred patients were randomly assigned to receive 20 mg atorvastatin or placebo once a day for 45 days, irrespective of their serum cholesterol concentration. Vascular surgery was performed on average 30 days after randomization, and patients were prospectively followed up over 6 months. The cardiovascular events studied were death from cardiac cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and stroke.\nFifty patients received atorvastatin, and 50 received placebo. During the 6-month follow-up primary end points occurred in 17 patients, 4 in the atorvastatin group and 13 in the placebo group. The incidence of cardiac events was more than three times higher with placebo (26.0%) compared with atorvastatin (8.0%; P =.031). The risk for an event was compared between the groups with the Kaplan-Meier method, as event-free survival after vascular surgery. Patients given atorvastatin exhibited a significant decrease in the rate of cardiac events, compared with the placebo group, within 6 months after vascular surgery (P =.018).\nShort-term treatment with atorvastatin significantly reduces the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events after vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has been proposed as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients excluded from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study and in those considered at high risk for CEA. In light of recently released CAS data in patients at high risk, we reviewed our experience with CEA.\nThe records for consecutive patients who underwent CEA between 1998 and 2002 were retrospectively reviewed, and risk was stratified according to inclusion and exclusion criteria from a \"high-risk\" or CAS-CEA trial, The Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) trial.\nOf 776 CEAs performed, 323 (42%) were considered high risk, on the basis of criteria including positive stress test (n = 109, 14%), age older than 80 years (n = 85, 11%), contralateral carotid occlusion (n = 66, 9%), pulmonary dysfunction (n = 56, 7%), high cervical lesion (n = 36, 5%), and repeat carotid operation (n = 27, 3%). Other high-risk criteria included recent myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac surgery, or class III or IV cardiac status; left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%; contralateral laryngeal palsy; and previous neck irradiation (each <1.5%). Clinical presentation was similar in the high-risk and low-risk groups: asymptomatic (73% versus 73%), transient ischemic attack (23% vs 22%), and previous stroke (4% vs 5%). The overall postoperative stroke rate was 1.4% (symptomatic, 2.9%; asymptomatic, 0.9%). Comparison of high-risk and low-risk CEAs demonstrated no statistical difference in the stroke rate. Factors associated with significantly increased stroke risk included cervical radiation therapy, class III or IV angina, symptomatic presentation, and age 60 years or younger. Overall mortality was 0.3% (symptomatic, 0.5%; asymptomatic, 0.2%), not significantly different between the high-risk (0.6%) and low-risk groups (0.0%). Non-Q-wave MI was more frequent in the high-risk group (3.1 vs 0.9%; P <.05). A composite cluster of adverse clinical events (death, stroke, MI) was more frequent in the symptomatic high-risk group (9.3% vs 1.6%; P <.005), but not in the asymptomatic cohort. There was a trend for more major cranial nerve injuries in patients with local risk factors, such as high carotid bifurcation, repeat operation, and cervical radiation therapy (4.6% vs 1.7%; P <.13). In 121 patients excluded on the basis of synchronous or immediate subsequent operations, who also would have been excluded from SAPPHIRE, the overall rates for stroke (1.65%; P =.69), death (1.65%; P =.09), and MI (0.83%; P =.71) were not significantly different from those in the study population.\nCEA can be performed in patients at high risk, with stroke and death rates well within accepted standards. These data question the use of CAS as an alternative to CEA, even in patients at high risk.",

    "abstract": "Failure of the adrenocortical system after open repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA) has never been reported, to our knowledge. This study was undertaken to examine the incidence and response to treatment of adrenal insufficiency in the RAAA population.\nA 6-year retrospective analysis was carried out on data for all patients admitted after RAAA repair. A cosyntropin stimulation test (CST) was performed in patients with unexplained postoperative hypotension. Patients with adrenal insufficiency were given stress dose hydrocortisone, followed by slow hydrocortisone taper.\nTwenty of 26 patients admitted after RAAA repair survived longer than 1 week. Nine of these 20 patients underwent CST because of unexplained hypotension, and six patients were found to have adrenal insufficiency. Compared with the three patients with normal CST and the 11 patients with normotension who did not require testing, patients with adrenal insufficiency had greater preoperative hypotension (83% vs 29%; P =.05), greater operative blood loss (7.0 +/- 1.6 L vs 3.0 +/- 0.9 L; P =.003), longer lower extremity ischemia time (5.0 +/- 2.3 hours vs 1.3 +/- 0.5 hours; P =.025), and lower intraoperative urine output (0.8 +/- 0.4 mL/kg/hr vs 2.1 +/- 0.6 mL/kg/hr; P =.023). No difference in length of stay (40 +/- 18 days vs 35 +/- 26 days), major complications (27% vs 32%), or overall mortality (17% vs 15%) was demonstrated with steroid therapy. Initiation of steroid therapy enabled weaning of vasopressor support within 48 hours in patients with adrenal insufficiency.\nAdrenal insufficiency was identified in 67% of patients with RAAA with unexplained postoperative hypotension given a CST. Predictors of adrenal insufficiency after RAAA repair include preoperative hypotension and a complicated operative course. Steroid therapy can limit vasopressor dependence, and is not associated with increased morbidity or mortality.",

Initiation of steroid therapy enabled weaning of vasopressor support within 48 hours in patients with adrenal insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "May-Thurner syndrome is a well-recognized anatomic variant that is associated with the development of symptomatic acute venous thrombosis of the left iliac vein. However, the natural frequency of compression of the left iliac vein and its clinical significance in asymptomatic disease has not been established. Therefore the purpose of this descriptive anatomic study was to determine the incidence of left common iliac vein compression in an asymptomatic population.\nA retrospective analysis of medical records and helical abdominal computed tomography scans was conducted in 50 consecutive patients evaluated in the emergency department because of abdominal pain. Medical records were reviewed for symptoms and risk factors for deep venous thrombosis, and data were collected and reported according to the Joint Society Reporting Standards for acute lower extremity venous thrombosis. All computed tomography was performed with intravenous contrast medium, and 2-mm to 5-mm axial images were obtained. The minor diameter of the common iliac arteries and veins was measured. The technique of transverse image measurement was validated with multiplanar reconstructions and orthogonal diameter measurements in a subset of subjects. Statistical analysis was performed with the Student t test or Spearman rank correlation.\nMean age of subjects without symptoms was 40 years (range, 19-85 years), and 60% (n = 30) were female patients. The mean acute lower extremity venous thrombosis risk factor score was 1.16 +/- 0.23 (range, 0-6; maximum possible score, 28). It was surprising that 24% (n = 12) of patients had greater than 50% compression and 66% (n = 33) had greater than 25% compression. Mean compression of the left common iliac vein was 35.5% (range, -5.6%-74.8%). The structure most often compressing the left common iliac vein against the vertebral body was the right common iliac artery (84%). There was no strong correlation between patient age or common iliac artery size and compression of the left common iliac vein. However, women had greater mean compression of the left common iliac vein (women, 41.2% +/- 3.1%; men, 27.0% +/- 3.0%; P =.003).\nHemodynamically significant left common iliac vein compression is a frequent anatomic variant in asymptomatic individuals. Therefore compression of the left iliac vein may represent a normal anatomic pattern that has thus far been thought of as a pathologic condition.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiologic studies of vascular injuries are usually limited to those caused by trauma. The purpose of this study was to review the management and clinical outcome in patients with operative injuries to abdominal and pelvic veins.\nClinical data and outcome in all patients with iatrogenic venous injuries during abdominal and pelvic operations between 1985 and 2002 were reviewed.\nForty patients (21 men, 19 women; mean age, 51 years [range, 27-87 years]) sustained 44 venous injuries. Injuries occurred during general (30%), colorectal (23%), orthopedic (20%), gynecologic (15%), and other (12%) operations. Factors leading to injury included oncologic resection (65%), difficult anatomic exposure (63%), previous operation (48%), recurrent tumor (28%), and radiation therapy (20%). All patients had substantial bleeding (mean, 3985 mL; range, 500-20,000 mL). Injuries were located in the inferior vena cava (n = 6), portal vein (n = 7), renal vein (n = 1), and iliac vein (n = 30). Repair was performed with venorrhaphy (64%), end-to-end anastomosis (14%), interposition graft (20%), and vessel ligation (2%). Seven patients (18%) died of injury-related causes, including multisystem organ failure (n = 4), uncontrollable bleeding (n = 2), and pulmonary embolism (n = 1). Thirteen patients (32.5%) had major injury-related complications, including repeat exploration because of bleeding (n = 6), multisystem organ failure (n = 6), and venous thrombosis (n = 4). In two patients (5%) unilateral lower extremity edema developed, with no evidence of thrombosis. There was no late graft or venous thrombosis. Variables associated with increased risk for death were massive bleeding, acidosis, hypotension, and hypothermia (P <.05).\nOperative injuries of abdominal and pelvic veins occur in patients undergoing oncologic resection and those with difficult anatomic exposure, owing to previous operation, recurrent tumor, or radiation therapy. Massive blood loss, acidosis, hypotension, and hypothermia are associated with increased risk for death. Repair of venous injuries offers durable results with low incidence of graft or venous thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Transcatheter embolization has emerged as the treatment of choice for pelvic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), because surgical resection may be difficult and is associated with a high recurrence rate. We report a patient with a large recurrent pelvic AVM in whom transcatheter embolization was not feasible. This patient underwent surgical resection of the AVM, which was accomplished with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Early postoperative angiography demonstrated a small amount of residual AVM, which was successfully embolized with microcoils. Follow-up magnetic resonance angiography at 2 months showed no residual AVM. In cases where surgical resection of an extensive AVM is required, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest offers the distinct advantages of performing the resection in a bloodless field and enabling adequate visualization of important adjacent structures.",

    "abstract": "In human beings, chronic venous insufficiency is linked to venous hypertension. This in turn is associated with venous valve incompetence. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that venous hypertension serves to initiate a process that results in the venous valve and venous wall damage observed in venous insufficiency. Material and methods Acute venous hypertension was produced by creation of an arteriovenous (AV) fistula between the femoral artery and vein in Wistar rats. At specified intervals pressure in the veins was recorded. The proximal valve containing saphenous vein was exposed, and reflux was measured from reverse blood flow through the first proximal valve. The vein was excised, valve parameters were measured, a portion was taken for morphologic investigation, and the remaining specimen was frozen in liquid nitrogen for investigation of leukocyte infiltration, expression of adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) levels, and apoptotic markers. Contralateral nonpressurized saphenous veins were used as control specimens.\nThe saphenous and femoral veins were immediately distended by pulsatile blood flow from the arterial system. Pressure was significantly increased from 11 +/- 2 mm Hg to 94 +/- 9 mm Hg. At 2 days no reflux was detected in the saphenous veins. At 1 week, one of four rats exhibited reflux; at 2 weeks, two of four rats had reflux; and at 3 weeks, three of four rats showed reflux. Contralateral saphenous veins were uniformly competent. Compared with control specimens, the veins were dilated; leaflet length and leaflet width were significantly reduced. Granulocytes, monocytes, and macrophages were identified in all regions of the vein wall, and the number was increased by the presence of the AV fistula. The number of T-lymphocytes was increased, and B-lymphocytes were present. P-selectin was upregulated in the saphenous vein walls, as was intercellular adhesion molecules. MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in the veins was not enhanced. In the nuclear factor kappabeta family, Ikappabeta was not increased in any hypertensive veins. The number of apoptotic cells in the vein wall was increased in the presence of the AV fistula.\nThis study indicates that acute venous hypertension is accompanied by significant venous distention and some valve damage as early as 3 weeks after fistula creation. There is development of inflammatory markers, with leukocyte infiltration and increased adhesion molecule expression. We could not detect significant enhancement of MMP levels or nuclear transcription factors. It is uncertain whether this lack of evidence may be partially due to enhanced apoptosis in venous valves and vein walls. A detailed definition of the inflammatory reaction produced by venous hypertension should be the subject of further study. Clinical relevance Saphenous vein valves when observed at the time of vein stripping show deformities of shortening, scarring, and tearing. The current model of induced venous hypertension demonstrates early venous valve changes similar to those observed in human beings and links them to a venous hypertension-induced inflammatory reaction. Thus the model could be useful in pharmacologic testing to prevent or treat venous insufficiency and for defining the fundamental mechanisms that cause varicose veins.",

    "abstract": "Intimal hyperplasia and graft thrombosis are major causes of graft failure. Heparin prolongs graft patency and inhibits neointimal hyperplasia in animal models. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a heparin-coated expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft on platelet deposition and anastomotic neointimal hyperplasia after aortoiliac bypass grafting in a baboon model.\nHeparin-coated ePTFE grafts (4-mm diameter) were incorporated into exteriorized femoral arteriovenous shunts placed in five baboons. Platelet deposition was analyzed by measuring the accumulation of indium 111-labeled platelets on the grafts, with dynamic scintillation camera imaging. Eight adult male baboons (mean weight, 9.3 kg) underwent bilateral aortoiliac bypass grafting with ePTFE grafts (4-mm internal diameter). In each animal a heparin-coated ePTFE graft was placed in one aortoiliac artery, and an uncoated graft, which served as the control, was placed in the contralateral aortoiliac artery. All grafts were harvested at 4 weeks, and were analyzed quantitatively for neointimal hyperplasia at graft-vessel anastomoses.\nEarly platelet deposition on heparin-coated grafts after 1 to 4 hours of ex vivo circuitry was significantly reduced. All the harvested aortoiliac grafts were patent at 4 weeks. There was a significant reduction in neointimal area at both proximal (0.26 +/- 0.11 mm(2)) and distal (0.29 +/- 0.14 mm(2)) anastomoses in the heparin-coated grafts, compared with proximal (0.56 +/- 0.18 mm(2)) and distal (0.63 +/- 0.21 mm(2)) anastomoses in the untreated control grafts (P <.05). In addition, neointimal cell proliferation assayed with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation was reduced in the graft neointima (3.47% +/- 0.43%) in heparin-coated grafts compared with the graft neointima (6.21% +/- 0.59%) in untreated control grafts (P <.05).\nSmall-caliber heparin-coated ePTFE grafts significantly reduce platelet deposition and anastomotic neointimal hyperplasia and cell proliferation, without measurable side effects, in baboons. Surface coating with heparin in small-caliber ePTFE grafts is useful for improving prosthetic bypass graft patency.\nAn autologous vein graft is the ideal bypass conduit in peripheral arterial reconstruction; however, many patients who undergo bypass grafting do not have adequate or available autologous vein graft. As a result surgeons often must rely on prosthetic grafts as an alternative conduit in arterial bypass procedures. Clinical outcomes with prosthetic grafts in peripheral arterial reconstruction are generally inferior to those with autologous vein bypass grafts, in part because of anastomotic neointimal hyperplasia. This study evaluated the effect of small-caliber heparin-coated expandable polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts in aortoiliac reconstruction in a baboon model. The study found that heparin-coated ePTFE grafts resulted in less intimal hyperplasia and less platelet deposition after implantation, compared with noncoated control ePTFE grafts.",

    "abstract": "We created a novel continuous infusion system to evaluate the efficacy of juxta-aortic doxycycline delivery as a transitional step toward developing hybrid drug/device treatment strategies for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease.\nControlled comparison of treatment outcomes was studied in animal models with molecular and morphologic tissue analysis in a collaboration between university and corporate research laboratories. Rat AAAs were created via porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) infusion and grouped and analyzed by subsequent treatment status (either doxycycline in vehicle or vehicle alone) and drug delivery method (continuous infusion via periaortic delivery system [PDS] or twice-daily subcutaneous injection). The main outcome measures were AAA diameter via direct measurement, medial elastin lamellar preservation via light microscopy, mural smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and SMC and macrophage density via immunostaining and counting, expression of matrix metalloproteinases 2, 9, and 14 and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 1 and 2 via real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and enzymatic activity via substrate zymography. Serum drug levels were analyzed via liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy.\nPDS (1.5 mg/kg/day) and subcutaneous (60 mg/kg/day) delivery methods caused comparable reductions in AAA diameter during the period of 14 days after PPE infusion. PDS rats gained more weight during the postoperative period (P <.001), possibly as a result of reduced serum drug levels and systemic toxicity. Doxycycline treatment reduced AAA macrophage infiltration and SMC proliferation significantly. Despite reduced diameter, circumferential elastic lamellar preservation was not apparent in doxycycline-treated AAAs.\nContinuous periaortic infusion lowers the effective doxycycline dose for experimental AAA limitation. Alternative biologic inhibition strategies might also be amenable to direct intra-aortic or juxta-aortic delivery. Periaortic infusion might improve the clinical outcome of minimally invasive AAA treatment strategies. Clinical relevance Aneurysm remodeling may continue after successful endovascular AAA exclusion. Continued proteolytic activity within the aneurysm wall potentiates late graft migration and failure. The doxycycline infusion system developed in these experiments may serve as a prototype for adjuvant treatment modalities that complement endovascular AAA exclusion. Local delivery of doxycycline or other agents active in AAA disease, either continuously or at selected intervals after graft implantation, may stabilize the wall and aid in maintaining aneurysm exclusion. Alternative delivery methods could include passive diffusion from either the graft material itself or treatment reservoirs incorporated into endografts. Given the recognized limitations of current technologies, adjuvant biologic therapies have the potential to improve long-term patient outcome significantly after endovascular exclusion.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular therapy has had a major effect on vascular surgery; surgeons perform tasks in three dimensions (3D) while viewing two-dimensional (2D) displays. This fundamental change in how surgeons perform operations has educational implications related to learning curves and patient safety. We studied the effects of experience, training, and visual-spatial ability on 3D perception of 2D angiographic images of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).\nA novel computer-based method was developed to produce 3D depth maps based on subjects' interpretations of 2D images. Seven experts (certified vascular surgeons) and 20 novices (medical or surgical trainees) were presented with a 2D AAA angiographic image. With software specifically designed for this study, a depth map representing each subject's 3D interpretation of the 2D angiogram was produced. The novices were then randomized into a control group and a treatment group, who received a 5-minute AAA anatomy educational session. All subjects repeated the exercise on a second AAA image. Finally, all novices were given tests of visual-spatial ability, including the Surface Development Test and the Mental Rotations Test. Comparisons between experts and novices were made with depth map comparison, a subject's perception of overall object contour.\nThe depth maps were significantly different (depth map comparison, P <.001) between the expert and both novice groups for the first image. After the educational intervention, the control group and the treatment group exhibited significantly different depth maps (depth map comparison, P <.001), with treatment group depth maps more similar to those of the expert group. There were no significant correlations between the visual-spatial tests and the novice depth map comparison with the expert group.\nThis is the first study to examine perception of endovascular images in an educational context. Perception of overall surface contour of 3D structures from 2D angiographic images is affected by experience and training. With application of methods of vision science to an important problem in surgery, this research represents a first step in understanding the nature of visual perceptual processes involved in execution of an increasingly common clinical task. These results have implications for understanding and studying the endovascular learning curve.\nThis research represents a unique collaboration in an effort to understand and solve one of the greatest problems facing surgical educators and surgeons. This research uses applied tools in vision science to understand the perceptual constraints involved in minimally invasive surgery. Specifically, we examined the mental three-dimensional maps experts use when viewing two-dimensional displays. Furthermore, we compared experts with novices in an effort to assist surgical trainees.",

    "abstract": "Surgery for extracranial carotid artery disease has been challenged by carotid angioplasty stenting because the latter is less invasive and avoids surgical trauma. In fact, the magnitude of the perioperative stress response evoked by carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has never been evaluated. Our aim was to determine the degree of surgical trauma caused by CEA and to define differences related to the use of locoregional or general anesthesia.\nWe prospectively studied 113 consecutive CEAs performed on 109 patients admitted at a community institutional center. Patients were stratified for demographics and risk factors and operated on under locoregional (LA) or general anesthesia (GA) depending on both the surgeon preference and patient's compliance. Selective carotid shunting was performed for patients who manifested neurologic deficits under LA or had stump pressure values </=30 mm Hg under GA. Markers of the stress response, including cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, prolactin, and C-reactive protein, were measured intraoperatively, before and after carotid artery cross-clamping (CACC), and postoperatively up to the third day after surgery. Hemodynamic variability was assessed during surgery and for 24 hours postoperatively. Operative times were also measured. Surgeons were considered as independent variables for stress response. Statistics were run by means of nonparametric tests and univariate and multivariate analysis with a linear regression model.\nCEA was performed under GA in 63 cases (55.8%) and under LA in 50 (44.2%). The two groups were comparable in terms of demographics and risk factors. Intraoperatively, cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels were significantly higher in the LA group (both P <.001). CACC increased the intraoperative cortisol levels in both the GA (P =.019) and the LA groups (P =.006). However, in patients who underwent carotid shunting, this effect was abolished (GA group, P =.779; LA group, P = 1.0). During the early postoperative period there was no difference between the two groups. On postoperative day 1 the stress response was abolished in both groups. Prolactin levels increased intraoperatively in both the LA and GA groups and returned within preoperative values on postoperative day 1. Prolactin levels were higher in the GA group (P =.003 intraoperatively and P <.001 postoperatively). C-reactive protein significantly increased in both GA and LA groups on postoperative days 1 and 2 and started to decrease on day 3 with no differences between the two groups at any time. Hemodynamic variability and considered risk factors including individual surgeon were not significant variables. Gender-related differences were found only in prolactin secretion. The length of surgery had an impact for procedures that lasted >120 minutes. Three patients experienced an intraoperative neurologic event and had higher post-CACC cortisol values as compared to asymptomatic patients.\nIntraoperative surgical stress was higher under LA and was blunted by carotid shunting under both LA and GA. Within 2 hours after surgery the anesthetic modality no longer had any impact on surgical trauma. The stress response to CEA, regardless of the type of anesthesia, was abolished within 24 hours. Intraoperative stress response, namely hypercortisolemia, directly correlated with subclinical and clinical cerebral hypoperfusion/ischemia during CACC. Hence, attenuation of the stress response to CEA might decrease the incidence of cerebral ischemic events.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that there is a neural basis for baroreceptor deterioration during carotid endarterectomy (CEA), by investigating intraoperative hemodynamic changes induced by intraluminal carotid stretch stimulation, before and after application of local anesthetic to the adventitial layer of the carotid sinus region.\nThis was a prospective study of 20 patients undergoing elective CEA. During CEA, before removal of the atheroma, intraluminal stretch simulation of the carotid baroreceptors (rub test) was performed before and after injection of 1% lignocaine into adventitial tissue of the artery in the region of the carotid sinus. Continuous measurements of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), electrocardiographic r-r intervals (R-R), heart rate, cardiac vagal tone, and carotid sinus baroreflex were recorded to determine alterations in baroreceptor function.\nRub test before injection of lignocaine was associated with a decrease in MAP and heart rate and an increase in R-R, cardiac vagal tone, and carotid baroreflex response, indicating a functioning baroreflex. After lignocaine injection and repetition of the rub test, no significant change was seen in MAP, heart rate, R-R, cardiac vagal tone, or carotid baroreflex response, indicating a nonfunctioning baroreflex. Comparing the peak responses to the rub test stimulus before and after lignocaine injection showed significant differences for all variables (P <.05), with carotid baroreflex response and heart rate being highly significant (P <.0005).\nThe baroreflex response to intraluminal stretch stimulation of the carotid sinus area is operational in patients undergoing CEA, and this response is abolished by infiltration of local anesthetic into the periadventitial tissue around the carotid sinus.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective study was performed to investigate prolonged postoperative pain in the area of the proximal or distal scar or the bypass tunnel after femoropopliteal bypass surgery to treat symptomatic peripheral arterial disease.\nNinety-three patients with peripheral arterial disease who underwent femoropopliteal bypass surgery between January 2000 and December 2002 were included in the study. The short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire was used to score pain. Ultrasound examination of the soft tissue around the graft was performed to exclude other pathologic conditions responsible for pain, such as inflammatory processes, perigraft reactions, swollen lymph nodes, and hematomas.\nPain in at least one scar existed in 22 patients on average 13.9 +/- 9.8 months after surgery. In 10 patients pain existed simultaneously along the inguinal scar and the above-knee or below-knee scar. Pain along the bypass tunnel was experienced by seven patients. Most patients had mild to moderate pain. The mean numeric ranking score of pain severity in patients with pain was 4.2 +/- 2.3. The occurrence of prolonged postoperative pain was not associated with age, gender, diabetes, indication for surgery, material or type of bypass, number of preceding operations, or postoperative wound complications. Only follow-up time after femoropopliteal bypass surgery tended to be lower in patients with pain compared with those without pain.\nProlonged postoperative neuropathic pain along the distal and proximal incision or the bypass tunnel exists in one fourth of patients after femoropopliteal bypass surgery. Patients should be informed of this kind of complication before surgery. The results of our study justify further investigations of the origin and treatment of this pain, to find effective methods to reduce the incidence of prolonged postoperative pain after femoropopliteal bypass surgery.",

    "abstract": "Management of a nonhealing femoral wound after vascular surgery can pose a challenging problem, particularly when there is prosthetic material involved. We prefer to use pedicled gracilis muscle flaps (PGMFs) to cover problematic groin wounds when more conventional management is not possible.\nWe describe the technique for using PGMFs to provide groin coverage, report a summary of our short-term and long-term results, and describe why we prefer this reconstructive technique.\nTwenty PGMFs were placed in 18 patients to treat nonhealing and infected groin wounds. Exposed prosthetic vascular reconstructions were covered with the PGMF in 14 wounds, and in situ autogenous vascular reconstructions were covered in four. Seven wound infections were polymicrobial, 10 had a single gram-positive organism, and one had a single gram-negative organism. Pseudomonas cultured out in four wounds, and Candida in one wound. Two patients had a virulent combination of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. Complete healing was initially achieved in all wounds, and no patient died within 30 days of surgery. Two PGMFs failed, at 2 weeks and 2 months, respectively, one from tension on the flap pedicle and one from acute inflow occlusion. Underlying prosthetic reconstruction was salvaged in 12 of 14 wounds; the remaining wounds with autogenous reconstructions or exposed femoral vessels all closed successfully. At a mean follow-up of 40 +/- 10 months there were no recurrent groin infections. Seven patients died, at 2.5, 3, 8, 12, 14, 22, and 28 months, respectively.\nPGMF transposition is an effective option to cover infected or exposed femoral vessels or salvage prosthetic graft material in the groin. In appropriately selected patients, when complete graft removal and extra-anatomic bypass is not an acceptable option, gracilis muscle flap coverage is a viable alternative. The technique is relatively simple, and morbidity from PGMF harvest is minimal.",

Seven wound infections were polymicrobial, 10 had a single gram-positive organism, and one had a single gram-negative organism. Pseudomonas cultured out in four wounds, and Candida in one wound. Two patients had a virulent combination of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. Complete healing was initially achieved in all wounds, and no patient died within 30 days of surgery. Two PGMFs failed, at 2 weeks and 2 months, respectively, one from tension on the flap pedicle and one from acute inflow occlusion. Underlying prosthetic reconstruction was salvaged in 12 of 14 wounds; the remaining wounds with autogenous reconstructions or exposed femoral vessels all closed successfully. At a mean follow-up of 40 +/- 10 months there were no recurrent groin infections. Seven patients died, at 2.5, 3, 8, 12, 14, 22, and 28 months, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The invasive treatment of chronic lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) has become inconsistent. To standardize treatment at our institution, the Lower Extremity Grading System (LEGS) score was devised, based on arteriographic findings, symptoms, functional status, comorbid conditions, and technical factors. The scoring system was used to direct the invasive treatment approach in patients with lower extremity PAD. The purpose of this study was to prospectively assess outcomes of invasive treatment of lower extremity ischemia as directed by LEGS.\nFrom March 2002 through December 2002, 332 limbs in 227 patients with indications for intervention were scored and treated according to the LEGS score and followed for 6 months. Of the 227 patients, 66.1% were male; median age was 65 years. Diabetes mellitus was present in 44.9% of patients, claudication in 48.5%, and limb-threatening ischemia in 51.5%. Results of treatment as directed by LEGS were judged with the treatment outcome measures of reconstruction patency, limb salvage, mortality, change in ambulatory status, change in independent living status, and change in the short-form health survey (SF-36).\nOf 332 limbs, 61.5% with a score of 10 to 19 underwent endovascular therapy; 34% with a score of 0 to 9 underwent open revascularization; and 4.5% with a score greater than 20 underwent primary limb amputation. Interventions for the entire cohort as directed by LEGS resulted in 6-month primary reconstruction patency of 82.4%; secondary reconstruction patency, 92.6%; limb salvage, 90%; survival, 89.1%; maintenance of ambulatory status, 85.6%; maintenance of independent living, 88.4%; and statistically significant improvement in health assessment, regardless of treatment type, as determined with the SF-36. There was no statistically significant variability when comparing results according to treatment (open surgery, 0-9 vs endovascular therapy, 10-19) or smaller score group categories (0-5, 6-9, 10-13, 14-19).\nAt 6 months, treatment as directed by LEGS score resulted in acceptable outcomes. This project is the first reported prospectively confirmed standardization tool for treatment of lower extremity PAD, and, pending independent confirmation by others, provides a comparative baseline against which other standardization efforts can be measured.",

    "abstract": "Records for all patients in Ontario who underwent elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) or repair of ruptured AAAs between 1993 and 1999 were studied to determine whether the profile of surgeons or patients changed and to determine whether postoperative mortality changed over time. The secondary objective was to describe long-term survival after AAA surgery.\nA population-based retrospective cohort was assembled from administrative data. Surgeon billing records were used to identify operations performed between 1993 and 1999. Chi(2) and linear regression analyses were used to determine whether variables changed over time. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate long-term survival.\nFor patients undergoing elective AAA repair, average annual surgeon volume (P <.0001) and proportion of patients operated on by vascular surgeons (P =.02) increased over the study period; similar trends were noted for patients undergoing repair of ruptured AAAs. Surgeon volume was clearly correlated with mortality after both elective AAA repair and repair of ruptured AAAs; however, the benefit of this effect was modest beyond a surgeon volume of 6 to 10 ruptured AAA repairs per year or 20 to 30 elective AAA repairs per year. No change in crude 30-day mortality (4.5% for elective AAA repair and 40.4% for repair of ruptured AAAs) was noted during the study.\nDespite the finding that surgery to repair ruptured AAAs and elective repair of AAAs is being increasingly performed by high-volume vascular surgeons, there was no change in early mortality between 1993 and 1999. This may have been because average surgeon volume was already relatively high at the beginning of the study period, which translated into only modest benefit to further increases in surgeon volume.",

It was hypothesized that patients operated on by high-volume surgeons with subspecialty training would have better outcomes, which might argue for regionalization of AAA surgery.\nIn this population-based retrospective cohort study, surgeon billing and administrative data were used to identify all patients who had undergone AAA repair between April 1, 1992, and March 31, 2001, in Ontario, Canada. Demographic information was collected for each patient, as well as numerous variables related to the surgeons and hospitals.\nThere were 2601 patients with ruptured AAA repair, with an average 30-day mortality rate of 40.8%. Significant independent predictors of lower survival were older age, female gender, lower patient income quintile, performance of surgery at night or on weekends, repair in larger cities, surgeons with lower annual volume of ruptured AAA operations, and surgeons without vascular or cardiothoracic fellowship training. There were 13,701 patients with elective AAA repair, with an average 30-day mortality rate of 4.5%. Significant independent predictors of lower survival were similar, except gender was not significant, but the Charlson Comorbidity Index was. When the hazard ratios associated with predictive factors were compared, surgeon factors appeared to be more important in ruptured AAA repair, and patient factors appeared more important in elective AAA repair.\nFor elective AAA repair, and even more so for ruptured AAA repair, high-volume surgeons with subspecialty training conferred a significant survival benefit for patients.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze anatomic characteristics of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), with conventional two-dimensional computed tomography (CT), including comparison with control subjects matched for age, gender, and size.\nRecords were reviewed to identify all CT scans obtained at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center or referring hospitals before emergency AAA repair performed because of rupture or acute severe pain (RUP group). CT scans obtained before elective AAA repair (ELEC group) were reviewed for age and gender match with patients in the RUP group. More than 40 variables were measured on each CT scan. Aneurysm diameter matching was achieved by consecutively deleting the largest RUP scan and the smallest ELEC scan to prevent bias.\nCT scans were analyzed for 259 patients with AAAs: 122 RUP and 137 ELEC. Patients were well matched for age, gender, and other demographic variables or risk factors. Maximum AAA diameter was significantly different in comparisons of all patients (RUP, 6.5 +/- 2 cm vs ELEC, 5.6 +/- 1 cm; P <.0001), and mean diameter of ruptured AAAs was 5 mm smaller in female patients (6.1 +/- 2 cm vs 6.6 +/- 2 cm; P =.007). Two hundred patients were matched for diameter, gender, and age (100 from each group; maximum AAA diameter, 6.0 +/- 1 cm vs 6.0 +/- 1 cm). Analysis of diameter-matched AAAs indicated that most variables were statistically similar in the two groups, including infrarenal neck length (17 +/- 1 mm vs 19 +/- 1 mm; P =.3), maximum thrombus thickness (25 +/- 1 mm vs 23 +/- 1 mm, P =.4), and indices of body habitus, such as [(maximum AAA diameter)/(normal suprarenal aorta diameter)] or [(maximum AAA diameter)/(L3 transverse diameter)]. Multivariate analysis controlling for gender indicated that the most significant variables for rupture were aortic tortuosity (odds ratio [OR] 3.3, indicating greater risk with no or mild tortuosity), diameter asymmetry (OR, 3.2 for a 1-cm difference in major-minor axis), and current smoking (OR, 2.7, with the greater risk in current smokers).\nWhen matched for age, gender, and diameter, ruptured AAAs tend to be less tortuous, yet have greater cross-sectional diameter asymmetry. On conventional two-dimensional CT axial sections, it appears that when diameter asymmetry is associated with low aortic tortuosity, the larger diameter on axial sections more accurately reflects rupture risk, and when diameter asymmetry is associated with moderate or severe aortic tortuosity, the smaller diameter on axial sections more accurately reflects rupture risk. Current smoking is significantly associated with rupture, even when controlling for gender and AAA anatomy.",

    "abstract": "Behavior of the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) sac after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is graft-dependent. The Excluder endograft has been associated with less sac regression than some other stent grafts. Long-term follow-up has not been reported.\nBetween May 1999 and July 2002, 50 patients underwent EVAR with the Excluder bifurcated endoprosthesis. These patients were followed up prospectively with computed tomography (CT) at 1, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter. One immediate conversion to open surgery and three deaths occurred within 6 months. One additional patient was lost to follow-up. The remaining 45 patients, 35 men and 10 women, were followed up for at least 1 year, and form the basis for this report. Their mean age was 73 +/- 5.5 years. The minor axis diameter at the largest area of the AAA on CT examination was compared with the baseline measurement at 1 month and to the smallest size previously recorded during follow-up. Change in sac size of 5 mm or greater was considered significant. Mean follow-up was 2.7 +/- 1.2 years (range, 1-4 years). Nominal variables were compared with the chi(2) test, and continuous variables with the Student t test.\nA significant decrease in average AAA sac diameter was observed at 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up. These differences were lost by the 3-year evaluation, because of delayed sac growth (n = 9) and re-expansion of once shrunken aneurysms (n = 3). The probability of freedom from sac growth or re-expansion at 4 years was only 43%. At last follow-up, sac expansion occurred in the absence of active endoleak in nine patients. Type II endoleak was associated with sac expansion in three patients (P =.003), resulting in one conversion to open surgery after the 4-year follow-up. No graft migrations, AAA ruptures, or aneurysm-related deaths were noted.\nLate aneurysm sac growth or re-expansion after EVAR with the Excluder device is common, even in the absence of endoleak. Although the incidence of important clinical sequelae is low at this point, the incidence of aneurysm expansion should be taken into consideration during the risk-benefit assessment before EVAR repair with the Excluder device.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to study intra-aneurysm pressure after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in shrinking, unchanged, and expanding abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) with and without endoleaks.\nDirect intra-aneurysm sac pressure measurement (DISP) by percutaneous translumbar puncture of the AAA under fluoroscopic guidance was performed 46 times during the follow-up of 37 patients (30 men; median age, 73 years [range, 58-82 years]; AAA diameter: median, 60 mm [range, 48-84 mm]). Three patients were included in two different groups because DISP was performed more than once with different indications. Tip-pressure sensors mounted on 0.014-inch guidewires were used for simultaneous measurement of systemic and AAA sac pressures. Mean pressure index (MPI) was calculated as the percentage of mean intra-aneurysm pressure relative to the simultaneous mean intra-aortic pressure.\nMedian MPI was 19% in shrinking (11 patients), 30% in unchanged (10 patients), and 59% in expanding (9 patients) aneurysms without endoleaks. Pulse pressure was also higher in expanding (10 mm Hg) compared with shrinking (2 mm Hg; P <.0001) AAAs. Four of the nine patients with expanding AAAs underwent five repeated DISPs later in the follow-up, and MPIs were consistently elevated. Seven of the 10 patients with unchanged AAAs without endoleaks underwent further computed tomography follow-up after DISP; 2 expanded (MPI, 47%-63%), 4 shrank (MPI, 21%-30%), and 1 remained unchanged (MPI, 14%). Type II endoleaks (6 patients, 7 DISPs) were associated with wide range of MPI (22%-92%). Successful endoleak embolization (n = 4) resulted in pressure reduction.\nIntra-aneurysm sac pressure measurement is an important adjunctive for EVAR evaluation, possibly allowing early detection of failures. High pressure is associated with AAA expansion and low pressure with shrinkage. Type II endoleaks can be responsible for AAA pressurization, and successful embolization appears to result in pressure reduction.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to assess the effect on renal function of open surgery and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair with suprarenal fixation with the Zenith device.\nData for 279 patients with similar preoperative comorbid conditions were prospectively analyzed after AAA repair. One hundred ninety-nine patients underwent endografting with the Zenith AAA Endovascular Graft, which incorporates suprarenal fixation (Zenith standard risk group, ZSR), and 80 patients underwent open surgery (standard surgical risk group, SSR). Endovascular repair was also performed in 100 patients considered poor candidates for open repair (Zenith high risk group, ZHR). Serum creatinine concentration (SCr) and anatomic defects were assessed before the procedure, before discharge, and at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months in all patients who underwent endovascular repair, and before the procedure and at 1 and 12 months in patients who underwent open surgical repair (only SCr was measured before discharge). Renal function was also analyzed, with a creatinine clearance calculation (Cockcraft-Gault). Renal insufficiency was defined as an increase in SCr greater than 30% from a preoperative baseline value, any SCr concentration in excess of 2.0 mg/dL, or any need for dialysis. Cumulative renal infarction and arterial occlusion rates were calculated with computed tomographic, ultrasonographic, and angiographic data, and reported as cumulative values.\nDespite the initially superior renal function in the ZSR group at the pre-discharge evaluation (P =.01), there were no differences at 12 months with respect to rise in SCr greater than 30% (ZSR, 16%, vs SSR, 12%; P =.67), SCr rise greater than 2.0 mg/dL (ZSR, 2.5%, vs SSR, 3.4%; P =.66), incidence of renal artery occlusion (ZSR, 1%, vs SSR, 1.4%; P >.99), or infarction (ZSR, 1.5%, vs SSR, 1.4%; P >.99). Only one patient in each group required hemodialysis. Of note, both groups of patients demonstrated a reduction in creatinine clearance over 12 months, which then stabilized or improved by 24 months for ZSR patients.\nRenal dysfunction occurs in a subset of patients regardless of type of repair (open or endovascular with suprarenal fixation). The cause of renal dysfunction after open or endovascular repair with a suprarenal stent is probably multifactorial. The observed dysfunction occurs in a small number of patients, and the effect in the endovascular group (no data for the surgical group at 24 months) appears to be transient. The initial dysfunction, apparent in both groups over 12 months of follow-up, stabilizes or improves at 12 to 24 months.",

    "abstract": "The intent of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Zenith AAA Endovascular Graft compared with conventional aneurysm repair.\nThe study was conducted in a prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized, concurrent control manner. Physiologically similar patients with infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) underwent either open surgery or repair with the Zenith AAA Endovascular Graft. Separate analyses of physiologically challenged patients were performed. Follow-up was conducted at hospital discharge and at 1, 6, and 12 months (endovascular repair group) or 1 and 12 months (open surgical repair group). Evaluation included computed tomography, abdominal radiography, laboratory tests, and physical examination. Mortality (AAA-related and overall), morbidity, in-hospital recovery, renal function, and secondary interventions were assessed. Patients in the endovascular repair group were evaluated for change in aneurysm size, endoleak, graft migration, conversion, rupture, and device integrity. Statistical analyses were performed with the Kaplan-Meier method, Blackwelder test, propensity score assessment, two-sample t test, Yates-corrected Pearson chi(2) test, and Fisher exact test.\nConventional open surgery was used in 80 patients, and 200 patients underwent repair with the Zenith AAA Endovascular Graft. Technical success was accomplished in 98.8% of patients in the open repair group and 99.5% in the endovascular repair group. Patients in the endovascular repair group had fewer significant adverse events within 30 days (80% vs 57%; P <.001). All-cause mortality was similar (endovascular, 3.5%; open surgery, 3.8%). Aneurysm-related mortality was higher with conventional surgery at 12 months (3.8% vs 0.5%; P =.04). In-hospital recovery and procedural measures were better for endovascular repair in all categories (P <.001). The incidence of endoleak was 17% at 30 days, 7.4% at 12 months, and 5.4% at 24 months. Aneurysm shrinkage (>5 mm) was noted in more than two thirds of patients at 12 months and three fourths of patients at 24 months. Renal dysfunction rate did not differ between groups. Migration (>5 mm) was detected in four (2%) patients through 12 months; none was greater than 10 mm or associated with adverse events through 24 months. Three conversions were performed within 12 months, one because of aneurysm rupture. Secondary procedures were more common in the endovascular group (11% vs 2.5%; P =.03). In total, 351 patients had endografts implanted, and 6 patients were noted to have barb separations through 12-month follow-up. No stent fractures were noted.\nThe Zenith AAA Endovascular Graft is safe and effective for treatment of infrarenal AAAs. The high likelihood of decrease in aneurysm size provides evidence that treatment of aneurysms with this device reverses the natural history of aneurysmal disease. The importance of long-term follow-up is underscored by the small but defined incidence of barb separation and the potential for unforeseen failure modes.",

    "abstract": "To help understand past and future trends in vascular intervention, we examined changes in the rate of utilization, patient demographics, and length of stay from 1980 to 2000.\nWe reviewed the ICD-9 codes for all vascular procedures using the National Hospital Discharge Survey of non-federal United States hospitals (1980-2000).\nThe number of vascular procedures performed in this country increased from 412,557 in 1980 to 801,537 in 2000 (per capita increase of >50%). This increase was most evident in elderly patients (>75 years, 67% per capita increase in discharges). Long hospital stays (> or =7 days) for vascular procedures fell 41%, and short hospital stays (<24 hours) increased 15% over the period of study. The frequency of abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs remained relatively constant. Except for an interval in the late 1980s, and a minor decrease from 1997 to 2000, the frequency of carotid endartarectomy rose dramatically (69%). Lower extremity revascularizations increased steadily until 1990 but then declined 12%. From 1995 to 2000, there was a 27% per capita decrease in the number of renal-mesenteric operations. Correspondingly, over the past 5 years there has been a 979% growth in the number of percutaneous/endovascular interventions. Despite a substantial number of interventions for lower extremity vascular disease, there was a concomitant increase in the number of major and minor amputations.\nInterventions for vascular disease have increased dramatically, with a major shift toward less invasive treatments, particularly for the renal and mesenteric vessels and the lower extremities. These trends in procedural use suggest that vascular surgeons need to embrace catheter-based approaches if they want to remain leaders in the treatment of peripheral vascular diseases.",

    "results": "The number of vascular procedures performed in this country increased from 412,557 in 1980 to 801,537 in 2000 (per capita increase of >50%). This increase was most evident in elderly patients (>75 years, 67% per capita increase in discharges). Long hospital stays (> or =7 days) for vascular procedures fell 41%, and short hospital stays (<24 hours) increased 15% over the period of study. The frequency of abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs remained relatively constant. Except for an interval in the late 1980s, and a minor decrease from 1997 to 2000, the frequency of carotid endartarectomy rose dramatically (69%). Lower extremity revascularizations increased steadily until 1990 but then declined 12%. From 1995 to 2000, there was a 27% per capita decrease in the number of renal-mesenteric operations. Correspondingly, over the past 5 years there has been a 979% growth in the number of percutaneous/endovascular interventions. Despite a substantial number of interventions for lower extremity vascular disease, there was a concomitant increase in the number of major and minor amputations.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to review the initial results of carotid artery angioplasty with stenting (CAS) performed by vascular surgeons to treat bifurcation occlusive disease. Most patients were selected for CAS if they had indications for endarterectomy (CEA) but were considered at high risk for surgery.\nSince December 2000, 74 carotid arteries in 69 patients underwent CAS, with distal balloon embolization protection in 96%. Mean patient age was 72 years; 82% of patients were men. Indications for CAS included asymptomatic disease (62%), transient ischemic attack (TIA; 23%), and cerebrovascular accident (15%). Mean internal carotid artery diameter stenosis was 82%. CAS was chosen over CEA because of cardiac (49%) or pulmonary (4%) comorbid conditions, hostile neck (25%), distal extent of disease (6%), and contralateral cranial nerve injury (1%). CAS was performed in 15% patients who were good surgical candidates, because of patient preference. Pathologic conditions were primary atherosclerosis (81%), recurrent carotid stenosis (18%), and dissection (1%). Procedures were transfemoral in 95% of cases and transcarotid in 5%. In 30% of cases the contralateral carotid artery had 80% or greater stenosis or was completely occluded.\nTechnical success was achieved in 96% of cases. There were no deaths, no major strokes, one minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, 3), and one TIA (neurologic event rate, 2.6%). The single minor stroke resolved completely by 1 month. One patient (1.3%) had a perioperative myocardial infarction. Transient neurologic changes occurred in 8% of patients during the protection balloon inflation, and all resolved with deflation. Bradyarrhythmia requiring pharmacologic treatment occurred in 14% of patients. At mean follow-up of 6 months there have been two instances of recurrent stenosis greater than 50% as noted at duplex scanning. During the same period, 266 carotid CEAs were performed, with a neurologic event rate of 0.8% (major stroke, 0.4%; no minor strokes; TIA, 0.4%) and a myocardial infarction rate of 3%. Combined stroke and death rate was 1.3% in patients who underwent CAS and 0.5% in patients who underwent CEA.\nCAS with cerebral protection can be performed safely in patients at high surgical risk, with low perioperative morbidity and mortality. The durability of the procedure must be determined with longer follow-up.",

    "abstract": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) broadly reduce cardiovascular events, effects that are only partly related to cholesterol lowering. Recent studies suggest important anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties of these drugs. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of statin therapy on graft patency after autogenous infrainguinal arterial reconstructions.\nA retrospective analysis of consecutive patients (1999-2001) who underwent primary autogenous infrainguinal reconstructions with a single segment of greater saphenous vein was performed. Patients were categorized according to concurrent use of a statin. Graft lesions (identified by duplex surveillance) and interventions were tabulated. Comparisons between groups were made by using the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the Student t test for continuous variables. Patency, limb salvage, and survival were compared by log rank test. A stepwise Cox proportional hazards analysis was then employed to ascertain the relative importance of factors influencing graft patency.\nA total of 172 patients underwent 189 primary autogenous infrainguinal arterial reconstructions (94 statin, 95 control) during the study period. The groups were well matched for age, indication, and atherosclerotic risk factors. Procedures were performed primarily for limb salvage (92%), with 65% to an infrapopliteal target. Perioperative mortality (2.6%) and major morbidity (3.2%) were not different between groups. There was no difference in primary patency (74% +/- 5% vs 69% +/- 6%; P =.25), limb salvage (92% +/- 3% vs 90% +/- 4%; P =.37), or survival (69% +/- 5% vs 63% +/- 5%; P =.20) at 2 years. However, patients on statins had higher primary-revised (94% +/- 2% vs 83% +/- 5%; P <.02) and secondary (97% +/- 2% vs 87% +/- 4%; P <.02) graft patency rates at 2 years. Of all factors studied by univariate analysis, only statin use was associated with improved secondary patency (P =.03) at 2 years. This was confirmed by multivariate analysis. The risk of graft failure was 3.2-fold higher (95% confidence interval, 1.04-10.04) for the control group. Perioperative cholesterol levels (available in 47% of patients) were not statistically different between groups.\nStatin therapy is associated with improved graft patency after infrainguinal bypass grafting with saphenous vein.",

Overall primary patency, secondary patency, limb salvage, and actuarial survival were 95.6%, 100%, 98.0%, and 98.0% at 1 year and 85.1%, 96.9%, 98.0%, and 83.8% at 5 years, respectively. Bypass graft redo or revision was performed for stenosis in one and occlusion in four limbs. Two amputations were performed at 6 days and 63.6 months after initial aneurysm repair. No difference was noted between elective and emergent groups with regard to patency, limb salvage, or survival (P >.26), and no association between the number of identified target vessels and limb salvage or patency was demonstrated (P =.12).",

    "abstract": "Repair of thoracovisceral aortic aneurysms (TVAA) after previous open repair of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) poses significant challenges. We sought to better characterize such recurrent aneurysms and to evaluate their operative outcome.\nWe reviewed the records and radiographs of 49 patients who underwent repair of TVAAs between 1988 and 2002 after previous repair of an AAA. Visceral artery reconstructions were completed with combinations of beveled anastomoses, inclusion patches, and side arm grafts. In 14 patients visceral endarterectomy was required to treat associated occlusive disease. Sixteen patients had cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and 10 patients had distal perfusion during cross-clamping.\nPatient mean age was 72 years, and 80% were men. Fifty-one percent of patients had symptomatic disease, and average TVAA diameter was 6.2 cm. Mean time between AAA and TVAA repair was 77 months. Twenty-six percent of aneurysms were restricted to the lower visceral aortic segment, 35% extended to the diaphragm, another 35% extended to the distal or middle thoracic aorta, and 4% involved the entire remaining visceral and thoracic aorta. The 30-day operative mortality rate was 4.1% in patients with nonruptured aneurysms and 50% in patients with ruptured aneurysms, for an overall mortality rate of 8.2%. Fifteen patients (30.6%) had major morbidity, including paresis in two patients and dialysis-dependent renal failure in five patients. At late follow-up, three patients required further aortic operations to treat additional aneurysms, and four patients had fatal aortic ruptures. Two-year and 5-year cumulative survival rates were 61% (+/-7.5%) and 37% (+/-7.8%), respectively. At univariate analysis, operative blood loss was the sole significant predictor of major morbidity (P <.023), and rupture (P <.030, P <.0001) and aneurysm extent (P <.0007, P <.0001) correlated with both operative death and long-term survival. Only aneurysm extent (P <.010, relative risk 37.3) remained a significant predictor of long-term survival at multivariate analysis.\nElective repair of TVAAs after previous AAA repair can be performed with an acceptable level of operative mortality, though with considerable operative morbidity. Limited long-term survival mandates careful patient selection, and the high mortality associated with ruptured TVAA underscores the need for post-AAA surveillance.",

    "abstract": "The clinical significance of type II endoleaks is not well understood. Some evidence, however, indicates that some type II endoleaks might result in aneurysm enlargement and rupture. To identify factors that might contribute to aneurysm expansion, we analyzed the influence of several variables on aneurysm growth in patients with persistent type II endoleaks after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nIn a series of 348 EVARs performed during a 10-year period, 32 patients (9.2%) developed type II endoleaks that persisted for more than 6 months. Variables analyzed included those defined by the reporting standards for EVAR (SVS/AAVS) as well as other endoleak characteristics. Univariate, receiver operating characteristic curve, and Cox regression analyses were used to determine the association between variables and aneurysm enlargement.\nThe median follow-up period was 26.5 months (range, 6-88 months). Thirteen patients (41%) had aneurysm enlargement by 5 mm or more (median increase in diameter, 10 mm), whereas 19 (59%) had stable or shrinking aneurysm diameter. Univariate and Cox regression analyses identified the maximum diameter of the endoleak cavity, ie, the size of the nidus as defined on contrast computed tomography scan, as a significant predictor for aneurysm enlargement (relative risk, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.19; P =.001). The median size of the nidus was 23 mm (range, 13-40 mm) in patients with aneurysm enlargement and 8 mm (range, 5-25 mm) in those without expansion (Mann-Whitney U test, P <.001). Moreover, receiver operating characteristic curve and Cox regression analyses showed that a maximum nidus diameter greater than 15 mm was particularly associated with an increased risk of aneurysm enlargement (relative risk, 11.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-85.8; P =.02). Other risk factors including gender, smoking history, hypertension, need of anticoagulation, aneurysm diameter, type of endograft used, and number or type of collateral vessels were not significant predictors of aneurysm enlargement.\nIn patients with persistent type II endoleaks after EVAR, the maximum diameter of the endoleak cavity or nidus is an important predictor of aneurysm growth and might indicate the need for more aggressive surveillance as well as earlier treatment.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) is a molecule that has gained recognition as a crucial modulator of vascular disease. NO has a number of intracellular effects that lead to vasorelaxation, endothelial regeneration, inhibition of leukocyte chemotaxis, and platelet adhesion. Its role in vascular disease has been intensively investigated and further elucidated over the past two decades. It is important in the pathogenesis of many cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, intimal hyperplasia, and aneurysmal disease. In addition, NO has been used as a therapeutic tool to treat diseases that range from recurrent stenosis to inhibiting thrombotic events. Many commonly used medications have their therapeutic actions through the production of NO. This review highlights the vascular biologic characteristics of NO, its role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease processes, and its potential therapeutic applications.",

During therapeutic anticoagulation, significant left lower extremity swelling developed due to an iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (DVT). After percutaneous thrombectomy and thrombolysis, a high-grade stenosis was uncovered in the left external iliac vein, which was treated with an endoluminal stent. However, ipsilateral DVT recurred 2 months later despite continued anticoagulation therapy. Repeat treatment was successful. Pelvic radiation is a potential cause of iliac vein stenosis. Pharmacomechanical thrombectomy may have a useful role in management of complex iliofemoral DVT.",

    "abstract": "Food and Drug Administration-approved endografts are suitable for the elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) with favorable aneurysm anatomy. Our aim is to illustrate the feasibility and versatility of commercially available endografts for emergency AAA repair in hemodynamically stable AAA rupture.\nFrom June 2001 to July 2002, five patients presented with severe abdominal pain and were diagnosed with contained rupture of an infrarenal AAA. In all cases, patients were deemed unfit to withstand conventional open repair by both the referring outside medical center as well as our center's team. All patients were hemodynamically stable on arrival at our medical center. Measurement and selection of endovascular devices were based on computed tomography (CT) scans performed emergently at the outside referring center. The required emergently procured endografts were obtained within 2 to 4.5 hours (mean, 3.1 hours) of presentation. Complex anatomy at the proximal and distal fixation zones or difficult access was present in every case.\nAll patients survived endograft repair and had successful exclusion of their aneurysm sac on the basis of intraoperative arteriography and postoperative CT surveillance. All were discharged to home at baseline function within a mean of 6.8 days (range, 2-13 days). There were no deaths. There was one postoperative pulmonary embolism, one myocardial infarct, and one type 2 endoleak. Mean operative time and blood loss were 4.67 hours and 217 mL, respectively. At a mean follow-up of 18 months, CT scans showed stable or shrinking aneurysm sacs.\nIn patients with contained ruptured AAAs who present with hemodynamic stability and comorbidities that preclude open surgery, commercially available endografts are a versatile treatment option even in the face of complicated aneurysm anatomy.",

    "abstract": "Current strategies to create small-diameter vascular grafts involve seeding biocompatible, compliant scaffolds with autologous vascular cells. Our purpose was to study the composition and strength of decellularized vein to determine its potential as a vascular tissue-engineering scaffold.\nIntact human greater saphenous vein specimens were decellularized by using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Residual cellular and extracellular matrix composition was studied with light and electron microscopy as well as immunohistochemistry. Burst and suture-holding strength was measured in vitro by insufflation and pull-through techniques. To assess initial handling and durability of decellularized vein in vivo, a canine model was developed wherein decellularized canine jugular veins were implanted as carotid interposition grafts in recipient animals. After two weeks of arterial perfusion, these grafts were studied with duplex imaging and histologic methods.\nHuman saphenous vein decellularized by using SDS was devoid of endothelial cells and >94% of the cells resident within the vein wall. Collagen morphology appeared unchanged, and elastin staining decreased only slightly. Basement membrane collagen type IV remained intact. Compared with fresh vein, decellularized vein had similar in vitro burst (2480 +/- 460 mm Hg vs 2380 +/- 620 mm Hg; P >.05) and suture-holding (185 +/- 30 gm vs 178 +/- 66 gm; P >.05) strength. Decellularized canine vein functioned well in vivo without dilation, anastomotic complication, or rupture over 2 weeks of arterial perfusion.\nVein rendered acellular with SDS has well-preserved extracellular matrix, basement membrane structure, and strength sufficient for vascular grafting. These properties suggest proof of concept for its use as a scaffold for further vascular tissue engineering.\nThe following research examines the creation of a new small-diameter bypass graft. It is clinically relevant to patients who need distal arterial bypass, coronary artery bypass, or hemodialysis access, but who do not have adequate autologous vein for their surgeries. Future investigations will involve further tissue engineering of this vascular scaffold (eg, autologous endothelial seeding of its lumen) and testing the clinical usefulness of the completed graft.",

    "abstract": "The cardioprotective effect of red wine has been attributed to resveratrol. The resveratrol-induced protection against ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury has been documented in heart, kidney, and brain. Resveratrol scavenges free O(2) radicals and upregulates nitric oxide (NO). However, the presence of resveratrol-induced spinal cord protection against I/R injury has not been reported in the literature. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of resveratrol on neurologic functions, histopathologic changes, and NO metabolism following temporary spinal cord ischemia (SCI) in rabbits. Material and methods SCI was induced with occlusion of the infrarenal aorta in rabbits. In addition to the sham group (group S, n = 7), group C (n = 7) received vehicle 30 minutes before ischemia. Group R1 (n = 7) and R10 (n = 7) received 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg resveratrol instead of vehicle, respectively. Blood samples were taken to obtain nitrite/nitrate levels during the surgical procedure. After neurologic evaluation at the 48th hour of reperfusion, lumbar spinal cords were removed for histopathologic examination and malondialdehyde measurement as a marker of oxidative stress.\nFive animals in group C had paraplegia while 5 in group R10 had normal neurologic functions. The average Tarlov score of group R10 was significantly higher than that the score of group C (4.1 +/- 1.2, vs 1.2 +/- 2.2; P =.014). Histopathologic examination revealed higher neuronal viability index in group R10 compared with that of group C (0.82 +/- 0.24 vs. 0.46 +/- 0.34; P =.018). Nitrite/nitrate levels decreased in group C (from 357 +/- 20.15 micromol/L to 281 +/- 47.9 micromol/L; P <.01) whereas they increased both in group R1 and group R10 (from 287+/-28 micromol/L to 310 +/- 33.9 micromol/L and from 296 +/- 106 micromol/L to 339 +/- 87 micromol/L, respectively) during SCI. Malondialdehyde levels of group R10 was lower than those of group C (55 +/- 12.9 nmol/mg protein vs 83.9 +/- 15.1 nmol/mg protein; P =.001, respectively).\nIn this model of SCI, resveratrol decreased oxidative stress, increased NO release, and protected spinal cord from I/R injury. Resveratrol-induced neuroprotection is probably mediated by its antioxidant and NO promoting properties. Before considering the clinical use of this natural antioxidant, further research is warranted about its mechanism of effects, timing, and optimum dose.\nParaplegia that results from spinal cord ischemia is a catastrophic complication of thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta surgical procedures. Despite several surgical modifications and pharmacologic approaches, paraplegia has not been totally eliminated. On clinical grounds, the efficiency of currently used pharmacologic agents to prevent spinal cord injury during thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta surgery is very limited and their benefit is controversial. Preischemic infusion of resveratrol protects the spinal cord from ischemia reperfusion injury in rabbits. Following clarification of the underlying protective mechanism, optimal dose, and timing, resveratrol may used in humans as an adjunct to eliminate this catastrophic complication.",

    "abstract": "Long-term success of revascularization procedures is limited by recurrent stenosis, a reduction in vascular lumen area that results from neointimal hyperplasia. Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, such as losartan, have potential to prevent recurrent stenosis; however, to date, efficacy has not been demonstrated in either animal models or human beings. While we have previously reported that treatment with a satisfactory dose may be an important element in obtaining efficacy, oral delivery cannot achieve the required concentration. We therefore tested the ability of losartan to restrict neointimal hyperplasia after local delivery of an elevated dose in a fibrin glue.\nThe porcine saphenous artery was subjected to balloon angioplasty. Losartan (25 micromol/mL) was applied directly to the adventitial surface of the injured vessel after mixing with 1.0 mL of Tisseel. Neointimal formation was quantified after 14 days with morphometry, and immunologic staining was used to monitor expression of proteins associated with cell proliferation, migration, and phenotypic modulation.\nA statistically significant decrease of 82% (n = 5) in neointimal area was obtained with losartan, and cell proliferation, as defined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression, was inhibited by 97%. Reduced cyclin A expression in losartan-treated vessels confirmed that cell cycle progression was blocked; however, the presence of cytokeratin 8 and tenascin in the media and neointima of injured vessels, regardless of treatment, suggested that losartan does not restrict phenotypic modulation. Inhibition of MT1-MMP (MMP-14) expression by losartan indicated that this inhibitor likely suppresses cell migration as well.\nThese data demonstrate that losartan can effectively prevent recurrent stenosis when delivered locally with a fibrin glue such as Tisseel. Our results also indicate that losartan may operate by interfering with the expression of proteins required for cell cycle progression and migration.\nRelease of angiotensin II in response to vascular injury may promote neointimal hyperplasia, because this hormone can stimulate smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. This study demonstrates that local application of an angiotensin receptor antagonist, losartan, to the site of injury can effectively prevent neointimal hyperplasia after balloon angioplasty. Application of losartan to the perivascular surface of the injured vessel in a surgical fibrin glue enabled delivery of a dose that exceeds the maximum attainable, via a systemic delivery route. The glue also served as a depot from which the drug was slowly released over time. Treatment with losartan may be a viable approach for controlling neointimal hyperplasia at locations (eg, grafts) that are accessible during a surgical procedure.",

    "abstract": "Traditional therapies for arteriosclerotic disease often fail as a result of an exaggerated fibroproliferative response (recurrent stenosis) at the site of the intervention. Lysyl oxidase, secreted by activated vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, catalyzes a key step in the cross-linking and stabilization of collagen and elastin in the vascular wall. We hypothesized that lysyl oxidase messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression are time-dependent and precede collagen accumulation and luminal narrowing after arterial balloon injury in the rat.\nA 2F balloon-tipped catheter was used to injure the right common carotid artery in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Injured right and control (uninjured) left common carotid arteries were harvested at 0, 0.25, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 60 days for mRNA quantitation and immunohistochemical analysis. Steady-state lysyl oxidase mRNA levels were quantitated with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan). Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to alpha-smooth muscle cell actin and lysyl oxidase, and Movat pentachrome staining were performed for qualitative assessment of changes in the cellular and extracellular matrix components of the vessel wall. Post-injury intimal area was measured from hematoxylin and eosin-stained specimens at each time point.\nWhen compared with sham-operated control arteries, lysyl oxidase expression in balloon-injured arteries increased significantly to 212% by day 3 after injury, and remained elevated through day 21, with a decrease toward baseline levels by day 28. Lysyl oxidase protein expression did not peak until day 14, and persisted through day 28. Collagen accumulation peaked at day 28, corresponding to the maximal increase in intimal area, with later accumulation of proteoglycans and ground substance in the intimal lesion.\nOur results indicate that lysyl oxidase mRNA and protein expression is time-dependent after balloon injury of the rat carotid artery and that expression appears to precede maximal collagen accumulation and corresponding increases in intimal area. This suggests that lysyl oxidase may have an important role in stabilization of collagen and elastin at sites of vascular injury and that modulation of lysyl oxidase activity may be a viable method to prevent or reduce recurrent stenosis.\nFailure of traditional therapies for ischemic arteriosclerotic disease is often due to an exaggerated fibroproliferative response (recurrent stenosis) at the site of intervention. Recurrent stenosis can be viewed as an injury-repair process, with an initial stage characterized by cellular proliferation followed by deposition of extracellular matrix. This study focuses on lysyl oxidase, a key enzyme involved in stabilization of collagen and elastin. This study demonstrates that lysyl oxidase messenger RNA and protein expression are time-dependent, preceding collagen accumulation and corresponding increases in intimal area. Accumulation of extracellular matrix is a major factor in growth of the restenotic lesion, and modulation of lysyl oxidase activity may offer a therapeutic method for decreasing or preventing recurrent stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Extensive proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) contribute to development of fibromuscular intimal hyperplasia in response to balloon catheter-induced injury of the left carotid artery in Fischer 344 rats. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that endogenously generated nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins act synergistically to limit the extent of neointimal hyperplasia.\nThe left carotid artery of Fischer 344 rats was injured with a 2F balloon catheter. The following treatment was initiated 24 hours before arterial injury, and was continued for 2 weeks: N-nitro-l-arginine (L-NA; 10 mg/kg/d, in drinking water), indomethacin (1.5 mg/kg/d per gavage), and L-NA (10 mg/kg/d) plus indomethacin (1.5 mg/kg/d). After application of an overdose of pentobarbital animals were formalin-fixed. Subsequently, paraffin-embedded cross sections of the uninjured and injured carotid arteries were analyzed morphometrically. SMC proliferation was determined by incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine.\nTwo weeks after injury, L-NA caused a 1.29-fold +/- 0.29-fold (mean +/- SD; n = 14; P <.05) increase in the intima-media ratio, compared with control animals, whereas indomethacin had no effect. Combined treatment with L-NA plus indomethacin further increased intima-media ratio (1.65-fold +/- 0.5-fold over control; n = 14; P <.05). SMC proliferation in the neointima of rats treated with L-NA and L-NA plus indomethacin was elevated. Furthermore, neointimal cell density (nuclei per square millimeter) was reduced after combined inhibition of cyclooxygenases and NO synthases.\nThe present results of pharmacologic NO synthase and cyclooxygenase inhibition suggest that NO and prostaglandins are part of an endogenous growth inhibitory mechanism that synergistically suppresses intimal thickening.\nThe role of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) during vascular recurrent stenosis and atherosclerosis is not clear yet. In particular, the effects of selective COX2 inhibitors on the frequency of cardiovascular events is still controversial. It is shown here in rats that the application of a non-selective COX inhibitor does not affect arterial stenosis. However, the concurrent inhibition of endogenous nitric oxide generation and COX1 or COX2 causes overshooting neointimal hyperplasia. These results suggest that increased vascular stenosis can result from administration of drugs that pharmacologically block 2 or more inhibitory pathways that normally counterbalance the effect of promotors of neointimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Human saphenous vein (HSV) is the autologous conduit of choice for peripheral vascular reconstructions. However, vasospasm can lead to early graft failure. The leading cause of delayed graft failure is intimal hyperplasia.\nTo develop a proteomic approach to prevent vein-graft spasm and intimal hyperplasia.\nBiomimetic peptide analogs of the small heat shock-related protein HSP20, containing a protein transduction domain (PTD), a phosphorylated serine, and a sequence of HSP20 surrounding the phosphorylation site (PTD-pHSP20), or a scrambled sequence of the same amino acids surrounding the phosphorylation site (PTD-scHSP20) were synthesized. The peptides were used in muscle bath and organ culture experiments with human saphenous vein (HSV) segments. Cultured smooth muscle cell lines were used to determine the effect of the peptides on proliferation and migration.\nIn HSV rings precontracted with norepinephrine, PTD-pHSP20 but not PTD-scHSP20 led to relaxation. There was no significant difference in smooth muscle cell proliferation in cells treated with PTD-pHSP20 compared with PTD-scHSP20. Treatment with PTD-pHSP20 significantly inhibited cellular migration compared with PTD-scHSP20. Control, untreated, and PTD-scHSP20-treated saphenous veins had significant increases in intimal thickness after culture. This intimal thickening was completely inhibited by treatment with PTD-pHSP20.\nProtein transduction of biologically active motifs of HSP20 can affect pathologic and physiologic responses of HSV and represents a novel proteomic-based therapeutic approach.\nWe have been a part of the genomics era and are now viewing the emergence of \"proteomics.\" The genome is linear and relatively easy to examine; however the proteome is much more complex and dynamic. In essence, the purpose of gene therapy is to manipulate the genome to produce a particular protein. This manuscript describes a new proteomic approach in which the biologically active part of a protein is directly introduced into vascular cells. Peptides were synthesized which contained a total of 24 amino acids, 11 of which represent a protein transduction domain or \"carrier\" while the other 13 are the biologically active \"cargo.\" These synthetic peptides prevent spasm (contraction) and intimal hyperplasia in segments of human saphenous vein treated ex vivo. Preclinical development is currently underway to develop these molecules as a proteomic-based vein harvest solution to enhance vein-graft patency.",

    "abstract": "Barrier techniques have been proposed to improve the results of repeat surgery to treat recurrent saphenofemoral junction incompetence. We hypothesized that interposition of a silicone implant would contain postoperative neovascularization and thus reduce the incidence of clinical recurrence at 5-year follow-up.\nWe compared the results of repeat interventions with use of silicone sheeting with a control group without artificial implants. The study was performed in hospitalized patients in a level 3 referral center (University Hospital). All patients underwent new flush ligation in the groin, with stab avulsion of recurrent varicosities. Two closure techniques were compared: in group A (33 limbs) the groin incision was closed in two layers; in group B (35 limbs) a piece of silicone sheeting was sutured on the saphenous stump. Clinical examination and duplex scanning were performed after 1 and 5 years postoperatively. Limbs operated on were checked in particular for the presence of recurrent thigh varicose veins. Color-coded duplex scanning was performed to assess for the presence of clinically relevant neovascularization, defined as the presence of a new vein with diameter at least 4 mm and with pathologic reflux in direct connection with incompetent varicose veins at thigh level.\nClinical examination after 1 year showed recurrent thigh varicosities in 24% of limbs in group A and 12% of limbs in group B (P =.369). After 5 years recurrent thigh varicosities were observed in 58% of limbs in group A and in 26% of limbs in group B (P =.009). Duplex scans after 1 year revealed neovascularization in 27% of limbs in group A and 6% of limbs in group B (P =.018). After 5 years neovascularization was present in 45% of limbs in group A and 9% of limbs in group B (P =.0007).\nThe use of a silicone patch at repeat operation to treat recurrent varicose veins caused by new incompetence at the level of the saphenofemoral junction is associated with a lower incidence of recurrent thigh varicosities and neovascularization compared with a control group in which no additional barrier technique was used.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the neurologic tolerance and changes in ipsilateral hemispheric oxygen saturation during transcervical carotid artery stenting with internal carotid artery (ICA) flow reversal for embolic protection.\nThis was a prospective study of 10 patients (mean age 68 years) undergoing transcervical carotid angioplasty and stenting. All ICA stenoses were greater that 70%. Seven patients had an ipsilateral hemispheric stroke (3) or transient ischemic attack (4), two patients had a contralateral stroke, and one patient was asymptomatic. Nine procedures were done under local anesthesia. Cerebral protection was established through a cervical common carotid (CCA) cutdown to create an external fistula between the ICA and the internal jugular vein with temporally CCA occlusion. Venous oxygen saturation (SVO(2)) was continuously monitored through a catheter placed in the distal internal jugular vein. Mental status and motor-sensory changes were categorized and assessed throughout and after the procedure.\nAll procedures were technically successful without significant residual stenosis. Mean ICA flow reversal time was 22 minutes (range, 15 to 32). Common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion produced a slight (SVO(2) = 72.6%+/-9.4) but significant decrease (P =.012) in SVO(2), compared with baseline (SVO(2) = 77% +/-10.5). During ICA flow reversal (SVO(2) = 72.4% +/-10.1) cerebral oxygen saturation did not change compared with CCA occlusion alone (P =.85). Transient balloon occlusion during angioplasty of the ICA (SVO(2) = 64.6%+/-12.9) produced a significant decrease in cerebral SVO(2) compared with CCA occlusion (P =.015) and compared with CCA occlusion with ICA flow reversal (P =.018). No mental status changes or ipsilateral hemispheric focal symptoms occurred during CCA occlusion with ICA flow reversal. One patient with contralateral ICA occlusion sustained brief upper extremity weakness related to the contralateral hemisphere. Five patients sustained a vasovagal response during balloon dilatation, four did not require treatment, and one had asystole requiring atropine injection. Mean SVO(2) saturation was not different in these five patients compared with the five who did not sustain a vasovagal response. No deaths or neurologic deficits occurred within 30 days after the procedure.\nOur data suggest that transcervical carotid angioplasty and stenting with ICA flow reversal is well tolerated in the awake patient, even in the presence of symptomatic carotid artery disease. Cerebral oxygenation during ICA flow reversal is comparable to that during CCA occlusion. ICA angioplasty balloon inflation produces a decrease in cerebral SVO(2) significantly greater than that occurring during ICA flow reversal.",

This study examined potential factors associated with patient aversion of surgery.\nThis is a secondary data analysis of a prospective cohort study that examined patients referred for evaluation of carotid artery stenosis at five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. The study collected demographic, clinical, and psychosocial information related to surgery. This analysis focused on patient response to a question assessing their aversion to surgery.\nAmong the 1065 individuals, at the time of evaluation for carotid endarterectomy (CEA), 66% of patients had no symptoms, 16% had a transient ischemic attack, and 18% had stroke. Twelve percent of patients referred for CEA evaluation were averse to surgery. In adjusted analyses, increased age, black race, no previous surgery, lower level of chance locus of control, less trust of physicians, and less social support were significantly related to greater likelihood of surgery aversion among individuals referred for CEA evaluation. Patient degree of medical comorbidity and a validated measure of preoperative risk score were not associated with increased aversion to surgery.\nIn previous work, aversion to CEA was associated with lack of receipt of CEA even after accounting for patient clinical appropriateness for surgery. We identified important patient characteristics associated with aversion to CEA. Interventions designed to assist patient decision making should focus on these more complex factors related to CEA aversion rather than the simple explanation of clinical usefulness.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the results of remote superficial femoral artery endarterectomy (RSFAE) in conjunction with distal aSpire stenting.\nRSFAE is a minimally invasive procedure performed through a limited groin incision. Forty patients were included in the study. The indications for the procedure were claudication in 36 patients and limb salvage in 4 patients. RSFAE was performed with the MollRing Cutter device through a femoral arteriotomy. The distal atheromatous plaque was \"tacked\" with the aSpire stent, which is an expandable polytetrafluoroethylene-covered nitinol stent with high radial strength, yet is flexible and able to withstand compressive forces proximal to the knee joint. Before stent deployment, if the stent position is not optimal it can be wrapped down, repositioned, and re-expanded. Therefore, not only is the plaque end point tacked, but the collateral vessels may be preserved. All patients underwent follow-up examination with serial color-flow ultrasound scanning.\nThe mean length of endarterectomized superficial femoral artery was 26.2 cm +/- 6.2 cm (range, 13-41 cm). The primary cumulative patency rate by means of life table analysis was 68.6% +/- 13.5% (SE) at 18 months (mean, 13.2 months; range, 1-31 months). During follow-up percutaneous transluminal balloon or stent angioplasty was necessary in 6 patients, for a primary assisted patency rate of 88.5% +/- 8.5% at 18 months. The locations of recurrent stenoses after RSFAE were evenly distributed along the endarterectomized artery. There were no deaths and one wound complication, and mean hospital length of stay was only 2.1 +/- 0.5 days.\nRSFAE with distal aSpire stenting is a safe and moderately durable procedure. If long-term patency rates are similar to those of above-knee femoropopliteal bypass graft, this procedure may prove to be a minimally invasive adjunct for the treatment of superficial femoral artery occlusive disease.",

    "abstract": "Complete lower limb ischemia as a result of blunt popliteal artery injury is associated with the highest morbidity and amputation rates among all of the peripheral vascular injuries. The purpose of this study was to determine the possible benefits of routine use of a temporary intraluminal arterial shunt in patients with complete limb ischemia from blunt popliteal trauma.\nOver 3 years seven blunt popliteal artery injuries with complete lower limb ischemia were managed with insertion of a shunt at the initial phase of the operation. Data from these procedures was analyzed and compared with retrospectively collected data for 10 injuries with complete ischemia treated without shunts during the preceding 5 years.\nMean injury severity score and mangled extremity severity score were 9.3 +/- 3.49 and 5.7 +/- 0.95, respectively, in the shunt group, and 9.9 +/- 3.57 and 5.9 +/- 0.56, respectively in the non-shunt group. Mean ischemic time was 244.3, 24.3, and 268.6 minutes, respectively, for preoperative, intraoperative, and total ischemic time in the shunt group, and 273, 56.5, and 329.5 minutes in the non-shunt group. The difference was significant for intraoperative (P <.001) and total (P <.05) ischemic time. In the entire group, 92.8% of patients with total ischemic time greater than 4 hours underwent fasciotomy, 100% required repeat operation, and 57.1% had complications and required fasciotomy wound debridement. All patients (100%) with ischemic time greater than 6 hours required amputation, compared with no patients with ischemic time less than 5 hours. One patient in the shunt group (14.3%) experienced one fasciotomy wound complication (11.1%), compared with seven patients in the non-shunt group (70%) had 8 complications (88.9%) (P <.05). Mean number of repeat operations was 0.8 +/- 1.06 in the shunt group, and 1.9 +/- 0.73 in the non-shunt group (P <.05). One patient in the shunt group (14.3%) required fasciotomy wound debridement, compared with seven patients in the non-shunt group (70%; P <.05). Mean hospital stay was 14.4 and 23 days, respectively, in the shunt and non-shunt groups (P <.05). Four limbs in the non-shunt group (40%) required amputation, compared with 100% limb salvage in the shunt group.\nTemporary arterial shunting after blunt lower limb trauma significantly reduces total ischemic time, complications, repeat operations, amputation, and hospitalization.

    "abstract": "This retrospective review describes the surgical management and clinical outcome for renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) in 62 consecutive patients.\nFrom January 1987 through July 2003, 804 patients had operative renal artery (RA) repair involving 1206 kidneys at our center. A subgroup of 62 patients (42 women, 20 men; mean age 46 +/- 18 years) received repair of 72 RAAs. Demographic data, comorbidity, and surgical technique were examined. Blood pressure and renal function response were determined. Patency of repair was evaluated by renal duplex sonography. Primary patency and patient survival were estimated by life-table methods. Tests of association were performed using chi(2) and the Student t tests.\nSeventy-two RAs were repaired for RAA with a mean diameter of 2.6 cm (range, 1.3 to 5.5 cm). Bilateral RAAs were present in 21 patients. Associated conditions included fibromuscular dysplasia, atherosclerosis, and arteritis in 54%, 35%, and 7%, respectively. Hypertension was present in 89% (mean blood pressure, 171 +/- 35/95 +/- 19 mm Hg; mean medications, 2.2 +/- 1.2 drugs) and renal insufficiency was present in 8% (mean serum creatinine, 1.9 +/- 0.6 mg/dL). RAA repair included bypass (67%), aneurysmorrhaphy (15%), or a combination (17%). One planned nephrectomy (1%) was performed for un-reconstructable disease. Branch RA reconstruction in 78% used ex vivo cold perfusion in 50%, in situ cold perfusion in 29%, and warm in situ repair in 21%. Of 9 bilateral RAA repairs, 7 (78%) were staged and 2 (22%) were simultaneous. Combined aortic reconstruction was required in 6 (10%) patients. Perioperative death occurred in 1 patient (1.6%), and significant morbidity was observed in 8 patients (12%). Hypertension was considered improved in 54%, cured in 21%, and unchanged in 25% at mean follow-up of 48 months (range, 1-156 months). Among patients with renal insufficiency, renal function was improved in 3 (60%), unchanged in 1 (20%), and declined in 1 (20%). Follow-up patency (mean, 33 months; range, 1-118 months) was determined for 64 (91%) RA reconstructions. Product-limit estimate of primary patency at 48 months was 96%. Product-limit estimate of survival was 91% at 120 months.\nRAAs were repaired with low morbidity and mortality. Complex branch RAA repair using cold perfusion preservation and ex vivo techniques resulted in no unplanned nephrectomy, with an estimated primary patency of 96% at 48 months. Beneficial blood pressure response was observed in the majority of hypertensive patients. These results support selective surgical management of RAA.",

    "abstract": "We undertook a quantitative systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies to determine the effectiveness of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage to prevent paraplegia in thoracic aneurysm (TA) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) surgery.\nWe included RCTs and cohort studies that met the following criteria: elective or emergent aneurysm surgery involving the thoracic or thoracoabdominal aorta, documentation of postoperative neurologic deficits, and patient age older than 18 years. We excluded studies that reported results in 10 or fewer patients and duplicate publications. We identified eligible studies by searching computerized databases, our own files, and the reference lists of relevant articles and review articles. Database searching, eligibility decisions, relevance and method quality assessments, and data extraction were performed in duplicate with prespecified criteria.\nOf 372 publications identified in our search, 14 met our eligibility criteria. Three RCTs reported 289 patients with type I or type II TAAA. Lower limb neurologic deficits occurred in 12% of patients who underwent CSF drainage and 33% of control subjects (number needed to treat, 9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5-50). The pooled odds ratio (OR) for development of paraplegia in patients in the CSF drainage group was 0.35 (P =.05; 95% CI, 0.12-0.99). Similar results were found in five cohort studies with a control group (pooled OR, 0.26; P =.0002; 95% CI, 0.13-0.53). When all studies were considered together the pooled OR of TA and TAAA was 0.3 (95% CI, 0.17-0.54). There was no statistical heterogeneity among studies included in the meta-analysis. In six cohort studies without a control group, the incidence of paraplegia in high-risk TA and TAAA was 7.6%.\nEvidence from randomized and nonrandomized trials and from cohort studies support the use of CSF drainage as an adjunct to prevent paraplegia when this adjunct is used in centers with large experience in the management of TAAA.",

    "abstract": "Infected aortic aneurysms are difficult to treat, and are associated with significant mortality. Hospital survival is poor in patients with severe aortic infection, Salmonella species infection, Staphylococcus aureus infection, aneurysm rupture, and suprarenal aneurysm location. We reviewed the clinical outcome in 46 patients with primary infected aortic aneurysms and identified clinical variables associated with prognosis.\nData were collected by means of retrospective chart review. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used for risk factor analysis.\nBetween August 1995 and March 2003, 48 patients with primary infected aortic aneurysms were treated at our hospitals. Two patients with negative culture results were excluded. Of the remaining 46 patients, 35 patients had aortic aneurysms infected with Salmonella species and 11 patients had aortic aneurysms infected with microorganisms other than Salmonella species. There were 20 suprarenal infections and 26 infrarenal infections. Surgical debridement and in situ graft replacement were performed in 35 patients, with an early mortality rate of 11%. The incidence of late prosthetic graft infection was 10%. The 90-day mortality rate in patients operated on was 0% for elective operation and 36% for nonelective operation (P =.006, Fisher exact test). Independent predictors of aneurysm-related death were advanced age, non-Salmonella infection, and no operation.\nWith timely surgical intervention and prolonged antibiotic treatment, in situ graft replacement provides an excellent outcome in patients with primary infected aortic aneurysms and elective operation. Mortality is still high in patients undergoing urgent operation. Advanced age, non-Salmonella infection, and no operation are major determinants of mortality.",

    "abstract": "There are no published reports on the association between ethnicity and outcome after aortoiliac stent grafting to treat aneurismal disease. Because Hawaii is a state with an ethnically diverse population, we conducted a retrospective study to examine this potential association. We hypothesized that individuals of Asian ancestry may have higher complication rates after endovascular repair compared with non-Asians.\nAll endovascular devices placed to treat aneurysm disease from 1996 to 2003 were evaluated in two institutions. The association between ethnicity and access-related and device-related complications, both periprocedural and delayed, was examined with logistic regression analysis.\nNinety-two aortoiliac endografts were placed during the study period, including 87 in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms with or without iliac aneurysm disease, and five patients with isolated iliac artery aneurysms. Forty-four percent of patients were categorized as Asian, 39% as white, 16% as Pacific Islander, and 1% as African American. Access-related and device-related complications (ADRCs) occurred in 11 of 92 (12%) of these patients. The following parameters were significantly associated with ADRCs: Asian ethnicity (P =.015), age greater than 80 years (P =.02), and external iliac diameter smaller than 7.5 mm (P =.01). Asian patients were more likely to have experienced ADRCs than were non-Asian patients (odds ratio, 7.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-35.8; P =.015). Asians also had smaller external iliac artery diameters (P =.0003) and more tortuous iliac arteries (P =.03) compared with non-Asians. After adjusting for iliac artery diameter and tortuosity, the association between Asian ethnicity and ARDCs became nonsignificant (P =.074), which suggests that the association between race and complications may be at least in part due to small and tortuous iliac arteries. There was no association between age, gender, or ethnicity and postoperative detection of endoleak.\nOur data indicate that individuals of Asian ancestry are far more likely to experience adverse access-related and device-related complications after aortoiliac stent grafting than are non-Asians. We found that this association is at least partly attributable to the smaller and more tortuous iliac arteries in persons of Asian ancestry.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have documented poor patency rates in \"young\" patients (age 55 years or younger) with premature atherosclerosis undergoing aortofemoral bypass (AFB) to treat aortoiliac occlusive disease. Given the high reported graft patency rates with superficial femoral vein (SFV) grafts performed because of aortic graft infection, we evaluated the role of SFV grafts for AFB as primary therapy for premature atherosclerosis in a case-control study.\nOver 10 years 31 patients aged 55 year or younger underwent AFB with use of SFV (V-AFB). Case controls consisted of all patients 55 years of age or younger who underwent AFB with use of Dacron (D-AFB) during the same period (n = 80). In all cases this was the initial therapy (no repeat operations). The two groups were well matched for age, sex, weight, preoperative ankle-brachial index, and the comorbid conditions of smoking, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and renal insufficiency. There were more patients with diabetes in the V-AFB group (34% vs 16%; P =.05). Patients in the V-AFB group had more advanced disease, and the surgical indication was more frequently critical ischemia compared with the D-AFB group (90% vs 46%; P <.001).\nThere was only one perioperative death in each group. There were no differences in cardiac, pulmonary, or gastrointestinal complications. However, fasciotomy occurred more frequently with V-AFB (44% vs 1%; P <.001). Surgery time was longer with V-AFB (7.3 vs 4.5 hours; P <.001). Despite these short-term drawbacks, V-AFB proved superior at long-term follow-up. The 5-year primary patency rate was significantly higher with V-AFB than with D-AFB (100% vs 56%; P =.013). There was also a trend for higher limb salvage at 5 years (90% vs 62%). Four graft infections occurred with D-AFB, and none with V-AFB (P =.32).\nAFB performed with SFV grafts is a far more durable operation than standard D-AFB in young patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease. However, V-AFB is far more likely to require lower extremity fasciotomy, and takes almost twice as long to perform.",

A comparison of Excluder endograft deployment with femoral artery cutdown (FAC) versus percutaneous femoral access (PFA) for treatment of infrarenal AAA was undertaken.\nA single-institution, controlled, retrospective review was carried out in patients who underwent either bilateral FAC or bilateral PFA for endovascular repair of infrarenal AAA with the Gore bifurcated Excluder endograft between March 1999 and November 2003. To November 2000, 35 patients underwent bilateral FAC; since then, 47 patients have undergone bilateral PFA. All have been followed up for at least 30 days.\nMean AAA size was 5.7 cm in the FAC group and 6.0 cm in the PFA group. During hospitalization there were six access-related complications in the FAC group; three required early surgical intervention. In the PFA group nine perioperative access-related complications occurred, all consisting of either hemorrhage or arterial occlusion; seven required additional intervention, and were recognized and ameliorated while the patient was still in the operating room. At 30-day follow-up there were no additional access-related complications in the PFA group. There were eight other access-related complications in eight additional patients who underwent FAC. In patients undergoing bilateral PFA total operative time was shorter (PFA 139 minutes vs FAC 169 minutes; P =.002), total in-room anesthesia time was less (PFA 201 minutes vs FAC 225 minutes; P <.008), and use of general anesthesia was reduced (P <.001). No significant differences were observed between groups with respect to estimated blood loss (PFA 459 mL vs FAC 389 mL; P =.851).\nComplete percutaneous treatment of AAA may have some advantages over open femoral artery access, but it is not free from risk. Percutaneous treatment of AAA can be completed successfully in most patients, but should be performed at an institution where conversion to an open procedure can be completed expeditiously if necessary.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed the structural findings of explanted AneuRx stent grafts used to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms, and relate the findings to clinical outcome measures.\nWe reviewed data for all bifurcated AneuRx stent grafts explanted at surgery or autopsy and returned to the manufacturer from the US clinical trial and worldwide experience of more than 33,000 implants from 1996 to 2003. Devices implanted for more than 1 month with structural analysis are included in this article. Explant results were analyzed in relation to cause of explantation and pre-explant evidence of endoleak, enlargement, or device migration.\nOne hundred twenty explanted stent grafts, including 37 from the US clinical trial, were analyzed. Mean implant duration was 22 +/- 13 months (range, 1-61 months). Structural abnormalities included stent fatigue fractures, fabric abrasion holes, and suture breaks. The mean number of nitinol stent strut fractures per explanted device was 3 +/- 4, which represents less than 0.2% of the total number of stent struts in each device. The mean number of fabric holes per explanted device was 2 +/- 3, with a median hole size of 0.5 mm(2). Suture breaks were seen in most explanted devices, but composed less than 1.5% of the total number of sutures per device. \"For cause\" explants (n = 104) had a 10-month longer implant duration (P =.007) compared with \"incidental\" explants (n = 16). \"For cause\" explants had more fractures (3 +/- 5; P =.005) and fabric holes (2 +/- 3; P =.008) per device compared with \"incidental\" explants, but these differences were not significant (P =.3) when adjusted for duration of device implantation. Among clinical trial explants the number of fabric holes in grafts in patients with endoleak (2 +/- 3 per device) was no different from those without endoleak (3 +/- 4 per device; P = NS). The number of fatigue fractures or fabric holes was no different in grafts in clinical trial patients with pre-explant aneurysm enlargement compared with those without enlargement.

    "results": "One hundred twenty explanted stent grafts, including 37 from the US clinical trial, were analyzed. Mean implant duration was 22 +/- 13 months (range, 1-61 months). Structural abnormalities included stent fatigue fractures, fabric abrasion holes, and suture breaks. The mean number of nitinol stent strut fractures per explanted device was 3 +/- 4, which represents less than 0.2% of the total number of stent struts in each device. The mean number of fabric holes per explanted device was 2 +/- 3, with a median hole size of 0.5 mm(2). Suture breaks were seen in most explanted devices, but composed less than 1.5% of the total number of sutures per device. \"For cause\" explants (n = 104) had a 10-month longer implant duration (P =.007) compared with \"incidental\" explants (n = 16). \"For cause\" explants had more fractures (3 +/- 5; P =.005) and fabric holes (2 +/- 3; P =.008) per device compared with \"incidental\" explants, but these differences were not significant (P =.3) when adjusted for duration of device implantation. Among clinical trial explants the number of fabric holes in grafts in patients with endoleak (2 +/- 3 per device) was no different from those without endoleak (3 +/- 4 per device; P = NS). The number of fatigue fractures or fabric holes was no different in grafts in clinical trial patients with pre-explant aneurysm enlargement compared with those without enlargement.

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence suggests that the occurrence of cardiovascular events is not evenly distributed over time, but shows peculiar temporal patterns that vary with time of day, day of the week, and month (season) of the year. These patterns coincide with the temporal variation in the pathophysiologic mechanisms that trigger cardiovascular events and the physiologic changes in body rhythms. These two factors in combination contribute to the periodicity in susceptibility to acute cardiovascular events. The classic assumption of epidemiologic studies that there is a constancy in risk for disease during the various time domains has now been challenged by the emerging new concept of chronorisk. In the last two decades temporal patterns (circadian, weekly, seasonal) have been identified for several acute cardiovascular diseases, such as acute myocardial infarction, sudden death, pulmonary embolism, and stroke, with peak incidence for most in the morning and during winter. One of the most life-threatening cardiovascular emergencies, aortic aneurysm rupture or dissection, also demonstrates periodicity, characterized by a similar temporal distribution, which suggests a common pathophysiologic mechanism or triggers similar to other cardiovascular acute emergencies. We review the data on chronobiology of acute aortic rupture or dissection, and discuss various pathophysiologic mechanisms that account for this variability. It is likely that identification of consistent recurring patterns in the underlying risk mechanisms could provide potential new insights for more precise diagnosis and efficacious therapeutic intervention.",

Traditional surgical repair of these lesions is often difficult, especially if access within the thorax is required in patients at high risk.

    "abstract": "Chlamydia pneumoniae has been related to atherosclerotic disease in both seroepidemiologic and genomic studies. We performed a case-control study to determine seropositivity and DNA detection in arteries of patients with peripheral artery occlusive disease and of healthy subjects.\nThe study included 64 patients with peripheral artery occlusive disease, and 50 control subjects who underwent varicose vein surgery, matched to the patient group for age, sex, and tobacco use. The fibrinogen level in all study subjects was measured as a marker of inflammation. Blood samples were taken from all subjects for determination of immunoglobulin (Ig) G elementary bodies (EB) against C pneumoniae with microimmunofluorescence (MIF) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and of IgA EB with ELISA. The cutoff titers were 1:32 for MIF and 1.1 for ELISA. Biopsy specimens of arterial atheromatous plaque were obtained from patients, and of pudendal artery and saphenous vein from control subjects, and were studied with hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction.\nThere were no differences in fibrinogen level between patients and controls. The prevalence of IgG anti-EB with MIF was 78% in patients and 24% in control subjects (P =.0001; odds ratio [OR], 11.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7-27.2). Prevalence of IgG anti-EB with ELISA was 75% in patients and 16% in control subjects (P =.0001; OR, 15.7; 95% CI, 6.1-40). There were no differences in IgA anti-EB titers. Bacterial DNA was detected in 67% of atheromatous plaques versus 12% of pudendal arteries (P =.0001) and 4% of saphenous veins. A weak correlation was found between seropositivity and the presence of intravascular DNA.\nOur results support the hypothesis that C pneumoniae is related to the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic peripheral artery occlusive disease.\nThis study explored the infectious hypothesis in the context of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. This hypothesis has been supported by findings that certain infectious agents can cause or accelerate the course of diseases in which the possibility of a microbial cause was not previously proposed, as in the case of peptic ulcer and spongiform encephalopathy. The present study demonstrated the presence of Chlamydia pneumoniae and seropositivity in atheromatous plaques in patients with peripheral artery occlusive disease. These results contribute to a body of research that is opening up the possibility of treating atherosclerotic disease with antibiotic agents, and preventing it with immunization.",

    "abstract": "Vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration is a critical component of the hyperplastic response that leads to recurrent stenosis after interventions to treat arterial occlusive disease. We investigated the relationship between intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) and migration of vascular SMCs in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.\nHuman saphenous vein SMCs were used for all experiments. SMC migration in response to agonists was measured with a microchemotaxis assay. A standard fluorimetric assay was used to assess changes in [Ca(2+)](i) in response to the various combinations of growth factors and ECM proteins.\nThe calcium ionophore A23187 produced a rapid rise in [Ca(2+)](i) and a corresponding 60% increase in SMC migration, whereas chelation of [Ca(2+)](i) with BAPTA (1,2-bis [aminophenoxy] ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid) produced a fivefold decrease in PDGF-induced chemotaxis, suggesting that [Ca(2+)](i) is both sufficient and necessary for SMC migration. Stimulation of SMCs with PDGF produced an early peak followed by a late plateau in [Ca(2+)](i). To establish a relationship between temporal fluctuations in [Ca(2+)](i) and SMC migration, SMCs were pretreated with caffeine and ryanadine, which eliminated the initial peak but not the late plateau in [Ca(2+)](i), and had no effect on chemotaxis in response to PDGF. Incubation of SMCs with nickel chloride eliminated the late plateau, but had no effect on the initial peak in [Ca(2+)](i), and reduced PDGF-stimulated migration by fivefold. We then evaluated the role of calcium in SMC migration induced by ECM proteins such as laminin, fibronectin, and collagen types I and IV. All four matrix proteins stimulated SMC migration, but none produced an elevation in [Ca(2+)](i). Moreover, preincubation of SMCs with caffeine and ryanadine or nickel chloride had no effect on ECM protein-induced chemotaxis.\n[Ca(2+)](i) transients are necessary for PDGF but not ECM protein-induced SMC chemotaxis. Moreover, the ability of PDGF to stimulate vascular SMC migration appears dependent on influx of extracellular calcium through membrane channels.\nRecurrent stenosis after angioplasty or surgical bypass remains a significant challenge in treating vascular occlusive disease. In addition to growth factors, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins may be potent agonists of this process. In this study we show that the influx of extracellular calcium is an important mechanism for platelet-derived growth factor-induced smooth muscle cell migration but not ECM-induced migration. Of note, in clinical trials calcium channel blockers failed to inhibit recurrent stenosis. Our data provide mechanistic insight to help explain this negative outcome in that therapies designed to inhibit restenosis depend on the effects of both growth factors and ECM proteins.",

    "abstract": "Pro-inflammatory cytokine-driven mechanisms have been implicated in vein graft failure, though little is known about the effect of hemodynamic factors and anti-inflammatory counter-regulatory mechanisms. We hypothesized that early temporal expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 beta and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 proceeds by way of wall shear stress-dependent pathways in the arterializing vein graft.\nRabbits (n = 27) underwent bilateral jugular vein carotid interposition grafts, and simultaneous unilateral distal carotid branch ligation, to produce both low-flow and high-flow grafts in the same animal. Vein grafts were harvested at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days and were assessed for architecture, wall shear stress, and cytokine messenger RNA levels (quantitative real-time two-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction).\nThe model resulted in an immediate 90% flow reduction (P <.001, paired t test) in the vein graft on the ligated side, and a 36% increase (P =.01) in contralateral graft flow. This persisted as approximately 15-fold flow differential throughout the 28-day period. The construction yielded a 15-fold differential in wall shear stress between low-flow and high-flow vein grafts (P <.001, two-way repeated measures analysis of variance). Intimal hyperplasia began by day 3, and was 6-fold more in low wall shear grafts by 28 days (230.6 +/- 35.4 microm intimal thickness vs 36.1 +/- 17.6 microm for low shear versus high shear grafts; P =.001). For both cytokines time independently affected mRNA expression (P <.001, global analysis of variance). Exposure of vein grafts to the arterial circulation markedly up-regulated IL-1 beta at 1 day, with significantly more induction in the low shear setting (P =.002). IL-1 beta protein localized to the developing neointima at days 1 and 3. Conversely, IL-10 slowly increased until day 14, with significantly more expression in the high shear grafts (P <.001).\nVein graft adaptation induces early pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta expression and delayed protective IL-10 expression (most notable under high shear conditions), both of which are modulated by wall shear. These differential temporal windows offer strategies for appropriately timed pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory therapies to interrupt pathologic vein graft adaptations.\nNeointimal hyperplasia continues to limit the durability of vein bypass grafts. Emerging evidence suggests that inflammatory mechanisms drive the neointimal hyperplasic response. This study demonstrates that specific hemodynamic forces (altered wall shear stress) differentially affect early pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1 beta and delayed anti-inflammatory IL-10 signaling. These distinct temporal windows for IL-1 beta and IL-10 cytokine expression offer strategies for appropriately timed pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory therapies to interrupt pathologic vein graft adaptations.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable in vivo porcine model of type II endoleak resulting from endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), for the study and treatment of type II endoleak.\nEight pigs underwent creation of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm, with a Dacron patch with preservation of lumbar branches. An indwelling pressure transducer was placed in the aneurysm sac. After 1 week the animals underwent EVAR with a custom-made Talent endograft. After another week the animals underwent laparoscopic lumbar artery ligation. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography was performed after each procedure. Aneurysm sac pressure was measured in sedated and awake animals.\nAll eight animals underwent successful creation of an aortic aneurysm and EVAR resulting in exclusion of the aneurysm sac. After creation of the aneurysm the sac mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 72.5 +/- 6.1 mm Hg and the sac pulse pressure was 44.8 +/- 8.7 mm Hg. Postoperative computed tomography scans demonstrated a type II endoleak from the lumbar branches in all animals. While aneurysm sac MAP (56.5 +/- 7.9 mm Hg; P <.01) and pulse pressure (13.6 +/- 4.1 mm Hg; P <.01) decreased after EVAR, sac pulse pressure remained, with type II endoleak. All animals underwent laparoscopic lumbar artery ligation, which resulted in further reduction in the sac MAP (38.3 +/- 4.6 mm Hg; P <.02) and immediate absence of sac pulse pressure (0 mm Hg; P <.01). Necropsy confirmed the absence of collateral flow in the aneurysm sac, with fresh thrombus formation in all animals.\nWe present a reliable and clinically relevant in vivo large animal model of type II endoleak.\nWe set out to show that aortic aneurysm sac pressurization caused by lumbar arterial flow in the setting of type II endoleak can be reproduced in an in vivo porcine model of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair. Indeed, in this model the aneurysm sac pulse pressure was a sensitive indicator of type II endoleak, correlating well with findings at computed tomography, and lumbar artery ligation eliminated the endoleak, as demonstrated on computed tomography scans and sac pressure measurement. Therefore we believe this in vivo large animal model can be instrumental in the study of many aspects of the physiologic features of type II endoleak.",

Postoperative computed tomography scans demonstrated a type II endoleak from the lumbar branches in all animals. While aneurysm sac MAP (56.5 +/- 7.9 mm Hg; P <.01) and pulse pressure (13.6 +/- 4.1 mm Hg; P <.01) decreased after EVAR, sac pulse pressure remained, with type II endoleak. All animals underwent laparoscopic lumbar artery ligation, which resulted in further reduction in the sac MAP (38.3 +/- 4.6 mm Hg; P <.02) and immediate absence of sac pulse pressure (0 mm Hg; P <.01). Necropsy confirmed the absence of collateral flow in the aneurysm sac, with fresh thrombus formation in all animals.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory modulators are important in the pathogenesis of aneurysmal disease. Gene expression profiling of experimental abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) tissue demonstrated upregulation of the FK506BP12 (rapamycin binding protein) gene product. Rapamycin is a potent immunosuppressor that prevents recurrent stenosis. However, its effect on aneurysm formation has not been studied. We therefore examined the effect of rapamycin in an experimental rat AAA model.\nAdult male Wistar rats underwent elastase infusion into isolated infrarenal aortas to create experimental aneurysms. Rats were randomized to receive either rapamycin or placebo via gastric lavage daily starting on the day of surgery. On postoperative day 7 the aneurysm was measured, the infrarenal aorta was harvested, and the rats were euthanized. NF kappa B was measured with Western blotting as a marker of inflammation. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 protein levels were measured. Hematoxylin-eosin and elastin staining were used to examine tissue inflammation and elastin preservation.\nAneurysms were significantly smaller in diameter in the rapamycin-treated group (3.3 +/- 0.7 mm vs 4.5 +/- 0.5 mm; P <.0001). NF kappa B levels were significantly reduced by 64% +/- 14% in rapamycin-treated aortas (P =.023). MMP-9 was reduced in rapamycin-treated aortas by 54% +/- 22% (P =.043). Hematoxylin-eosin and elastin staining showed no changes in inflammatory infiltrate or degradation of elastin fibers in elastase-infused aortic segments in rapamycin-treated rats.\nRapamycin significantly reduces the rate of aneurysm expansion in the experimental AAA rat model by 40%. Biochemical evidence suggests that this is related to suppression of inflammatory signaling and decreased MMP-9 levels. Rapamycin could provide a new treatment for small aneurysms.\nHuman aortic aneurysms are characterized histologically by an inflammatory infiltrate with severe proteolytic destruction. Rapamycin is an immunosuppressive agent commonly used to control transplant rejection and intimal hyperplasia by modulating the inflammatory cascade. In this experimental model rapamycin suppressed aneurysm expansion, decreased NF kappa B activation (a marker of inflammation), and decreased matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels. It is hoped that rapamycin or other similar anti-inflammatory drugs will one day be able to control aneurysm expansion in patients",

    "abstract": "The cause of the coagulopathy seen with supraceliac aortic cross-clamping (SC AXC) is unclear. SC AXC for 30 minutes results in both clotting factor consumption and activation of fibrinolytic pathways. This study was undertaken to define the hemostatic alterations that occur with longer intervals of SC AXC.\nSeven pigs underwent SC AXC for 60 minutes. Five pigs that underwent infrarenal aortic cross-clamping (IR AXC) for 60 minutes and 11 pigs that underwent SC AXC for 30 minutes served as controls. No heparin was used. Blood samples were drawn at baseline, 5 minutes before release of the aortic clamp, and 5, 30, and 60 minutes after unclamping. Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, and fibrinogen concentration were measured as basic tests of hemostatic function. Thrombin-antithrombin complexes were used to detect the presence of intravascular thrombosis. Fibrinolytic pathway activation was assessed with levels of tissue plasminogen activator antigen and tissue plasminogen activator activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity, and alpha2-antiplasmin activity. Statistical analysis was performed with the Student t test and repeated measures of analysis of variance.\nProthrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count did not differ between groups at any time. Fibrinogen concentration decreased 5 minutes (P =.005) and 30 minutes (P =.006) after unclamping in both SC AXC groups, but did not change in the IR AXC group. Thrombin-antithrombin complexes increased in both SC AXC groups, but were not significantly greater than in the IR AXC group. SC AXC for both 30 and 60 minutes produced a significant increase in tissue plasminogen activator antigen during clamping and 5 minutes after clamping. This increase persisted for 30 and 60 minutes after clamp release in the 60-minute SC AXC group. Tissue plasminogen activator activity, however, increased only in the 60-min SC AXC group during clamping (P =.02), and 5 minutes (P =.05) and 30 minutes (P =.06) after unclamping, compared with both control groups.\nThirty and 60 minutes of SC AXC results in similar degrees of intravascular thrombosis and fibrinogen depletion. Although SC AXC for both 30 and 60 minutes leads to activation of fibrinolytic pathways, only 60 minutes of SC AXC actually induces a fibrinolytic state. Fibrinolysis appears to be an important component of the coagulopathy associated with SC AXC, and is related to the duration of aortic clamping.\nThe coagulopathy frequently associated with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair is thought to revolt visceral ischemia-reperfusion. The nature of this coagulopathy is controversial. The current study demonstrates that the major hemostatic alteration associated with supraceliac aortic cross-clamping is activation of fibrinolytic pathways. The magnitude of this fibrinolytic response is directly related to the duration of supraceliac aortic occlusion. Future efforts to treat this coagulopathy may well include judicious use of autofibrinolytic agents.",

    "abstract": "This report presents the results of a prospective randomized study that compared 2 grafts of different diameter: 6 mm, and 8 mm tapered to 6 mm at the arterial site, placed in the upper arm for hemodialysis in a selected population of patients younger than 71 years without diabetes.\nSeventy consecutive patients younger than 71 years without diabetes who required an upper arm graft between January 1997 and January 2002 and without previous access in the same limb were randomly allocated to receive either a 6-mm graft or 6- to 8-mm graft. Graft flow was measured every 3 months with the Doppler dilution technique. When access flow was less than 600 mL/min, fistulography was performed, and any stenosis was surgically treated with venous outflow replacement. Thrombectomy and associated stenosis treatment in the same stage was performed in all cases immediately after detection of thrombosis. Complication rate, and primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates were compared between the two groups with the Student t test and life table analysis.\nMean access flow was 975 mL/min for 6-mm grafts (range, 600-1500 mL/min; 95% confidence interval [CI], 889-1070), and for 6- to 8-mm grafts was 1397 mL/min (range, 1122-2700 mL/min; 95% CI, 1122-1672). This difference was significant (P <.01). Complication rate was 0.45 episodes per graft-year in 6-mm grafts, and 0.19 episodes per graft-year in 6- to 8-mm grafts (P <.01). At 1, 2, and 3 years, primary patency rates were 62%, 58%, and 44%, respectively, for 6-mm grafts, and 85%, 78%, and 73% for 6- to 8-mm grafts; log-rank comparison between curves was P =.0259. At 1, 2, and 3 years, secondary patency rates were 85%, 85%, and 85%, respectively, for 6-mm grafts, and 90%, 90%, and 90% for 6- to 8-mm grafts; log-rank comparison between curves was not significant, at P =.0603. At 1, 2, and 3 years, assisted primary patency rates were 84%, 79%, and 76%, respectively, for 6-mm grafts, and 90% for 6- to 8-mm grafts; log-rank comparison was P =.0414.\nThe results of this study show an advantage in terms of primary and assisted primary patency rates, and complication rate for upper arm grafts with diameter 6 mm to 8 mm over grafts with 6-mm diameter in a patient population younger than 70 years without diabetes. The finding of a similar secondary patency rate in both groups is probably due to the surveillance program with sequential measurement of access flow and prompt surgical treatment of stenosis. However, we needed twice the number of rescue procedures in 6-mm grafts to achieve a similar patency rate as with large-bore grafts. These study results must be carefully evaluated, taking into consideration the small number of patients and the selected patient population.",

Ankle-brachial indices were obtained, and duplex scanning of the superficial femoropopliteal and saphenous veins was performed. Patients deemed candidates for SFV ACCESS also underwent preoperative upper extremity arteriography and venography. A retrospective review of the complete medical record was performed, and a follow-up telephone or personal interview was conducted.\nThirty patients (mean age +/- SD, 54 +/- 15 years; male, 33%; white, 37%; with diabetes, 50%; obese, 21%) underwent SFV ACCESS among approximately 650 access-related open surgical procedures during the study period. The patients had been receiving dialysis for 4 +/- 5 years (range, 0-24 years), and had 3 +/- 3 (range, 0-17) prior permanent accesses, whereas 90% were actively dialyzed through tunneled catheters. In-hospital 30-day mortality was 3%, and the hospital length of stay was 7 +/- 7 days. Fifty-seven percent of the patients experienced some type of perioperative complication, and 38% required a remedial surgical procedure.

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to assess which ultrasound-derived parameter was superior for measuring venous reflux quantitatively and to evaluate the importance of popliteal vein valve reflux.\nA retrospective analysis was performed of 244 refluxive limbs in 182 patients who underwent ultrasound scanning, venous pressure measurement, air plethysmography, and clinical classification of severity according to the CEAP score. Reflux time (RT, s), peak reflux velocity (PRV, m/s), time of average rate of reflux (TAF, mL/min), absolute displaced volume retrogradely (ADV, mL) were compared to clinical class, ambulatory venous pressure (% drop), venous filling time (s), and venous filling index (mL/s) using nonparametric statistical tests. A P value of <.05 was considered significant. Limbs were divided into 3 groups: (A) axial great saphenous vein reflux only (n = 68); (B) axial deep reflux including popliteal vein incompetence with or without concomitant gastrocnemius or great or small saphenous vein reflux (all ultrasound reflux parameters of each refluxive vein added at the knee level) (n = 79); and (C) all limbs with popliteal vein reflux (the ultrasound data of the refluxive popliteal vein exclusively was used in comparison regardless of concomitant associated reflux) (n = 103). Limbs were also stratified into limbs with skin changes and ulcer (C-class 4-6) and those without (C-class 1-3) and subsequently compared.\nNo meaningful significant correlation was found between RT and the clinical and hemodynamic results in groups A and B. The PRV and TAF correlated significantly with the hemodynamic parameters. The PRV and TAF and clinical severity trended towards correlation in group A (P =.0554 and P =.0998, respectively), but was significantly correlated in group B. The poor hemodynamic condition in the subset of C-class 4-6 limbs in groups A and B was reflected in a greater PRV, TAF, and ADV in this subset as compared with the limbs in C-class 1-3. RT was not significantly different in the subsets of limbs, further suggesting that RT is not related to hemodynamic or clinical state of the limbs. No meaningful correlations were found in group C. Although the hemodynamic data were significantly poorer in the subset of limbs with C-class 4-6 than in C-class 1-3, the ultrasound-derived parameters were not significantly different.\nThe duration of valve reflux time (or valve closure time) cannot be used to quantify severity of reflux and is purely a qualitative measurement.

    "abstract": "The recurrence of varicose veins is a common and costly consequence of varicose vein surgery. Despite the long history and vast experience of varicose vein surgery, the exact cause of recurrence is still unknown. This study aims to investigate the cause of recurrence further by correlating findings from duplex ultrasound scans, resin casts, and histologic investigation at the recurrence of the saphenofemoral junction. In particular, frequency and neovascularization are evaluated.\nForty-nine saphenofemoral junctions (SFJs) from 42 patients who presented for re-operation on their varicose veins were examined with duplex ultrasound and physiologic air plethysmography tests before surgery. All patients had reflux at the groin for which surgery was carried out. Specimens taken during surgery were sectioned and stained for conventional histology and immunohistology, and 5 specimens were infused with resin to form a cast of the venous vasculature.\nAll but 3 re-operation specimens (94%) showed multiple vessels at the stump site of the previous SFJ ligation. Neovascular channels of variable size, number, and tortuosity accounted for the ultrasound appearances and reflux to recurrent varicosities in the vast majority of specimens. These new vessels connected to the common femoral vein at the site of the previous SFJ. In 2 incompetent junctions without femoral vein involvement, while small vessels were seen surrounding the femoral stump scar, ultrasound and histology confirmed both neovascular and residual (enlarged collateral) connections from epigastric and pudendal vessels into the thigh.\nNeovascularisation is the major cause for ultrasound-confirmed recurrence of reflux in the groin following varicose vein surgery.",

    "abstract": "Cocaine-induced arterial thrombosis is uncommon, and most reported cases involved small-diameter vessels such as the cerebral and coronary arteries. This study was undertaken to review our experience with peripheral arterial thrombosis presumed caused by cocaine abuse.\nHospital records were reviewed for all patients admitted over 10 years with acute arterial occlusion involving the peripheral arterial system. Patients with confirmation of cocaine use or of its derivative, crack cocaine, within 24 hours of hospital admission formed the basis of this study. Symptoms at presentation, management, and outcome in these patients were reviewed.\nThree hundred eighty-two patients with acute peripheral arterial occlusion were identified during the study period. The presumptive diagnosis of cocaine-induced arterial occlusion was made in 5 patients (4 men, mean age 38 years). Cocaine use was achieved via intranasal inhalation in 2 patients (40%), whereas the 3 remaining patients smoked crack cocaine (60%). The mean time between cocaine use and onset of arterial thrombosis was 9.2 hours (range, 2-20 hours). Symptoms at presentation included acute limb ischemia without pedal Doppler signals (3 patients, 60%) and abdominal pain without femoral pulses (2 patients, 40%). Arterial occlusion was confirmed on angiograms in all patients, which revealed aortic thrombosis in 1 patient (20%), iliac thrombosis in 2 patients (40%), superficial femoral artery thrombosis in 1 patient (20%), and popliteal artery occlusion in 1 patient (20%). Surgical thrombectomy was successfully performed in 4 patients (80%), and 1 patient (20%) underwent successful thrombolytic therapy for femoropopliteal artery occlusion. There was no perioperative mortality. All 5 patients who were discharged were available for follow-up (mean, 36 months; range, 6-75 months). There was 1 late death from myocardial infarction. In 1 patient recurrent lower extremity arterial thrombosis developed after 28 months, which was successfully treated with thrombolytic therapy.\nOur study underscores cocaine abuse as a potential cause of acute arterial thrombosis. Cocaine-induced arterial thrombosis should be suspected in patients with recent history of cocaine abuse with acute limb ischemia without an identifiable source or overt cardiovascular risk factors. Prompt angiography with operative or endovascular intervention should be performed to avert arterial ischemic sequelae.",

    "abstract": "As vascular surgeons perform increasing numbers of percutaneous catheter-based procedures, they will need to become familiar with varying methods of femoral artery closure. Few studies on closure devices have included significant numbers of patients with peripheral arterial disease. It is the purpose of this study to determine whether the Angioseal device (St. Jude Medical) is a satisfactory method of achieving femoral artery puncture site hemostasis in these patients.\nThe records of all patients undergoing Angioseal closure of femoral artery puncture by a single vascular surgeon were reviewed. Indication, type of intervention, and size of the vascular sheath employed were recorded. Times to mobilization and discharge were determined. Patients were seen before discharge and 1, 4, and 12 weeks after the procedure, and at 3- month intervals thereafter. Complications including hemorrhage, pseudoaneurysm, infection, and vessel occlusion were noted.\nBetween February 1, 2002, and August 31, 2003, 220 Angioseal collagen plugs were deployed in 188 patients. Attempts were made to deploy Angioseal devices in 92% of patients undergoing percutaneous procedures during this time period. One hundred forty-four procedures were diagnostic and 74 procedures included 76 therapeutic interventions. One hundred forty-four 5F sheaths, 47 6F sheaths, and 29 7F sheaths were employed during the procedures. Time to mobilization and discharge was 58 +/- 19 minutes and 102 +/- 31 minutes in patients undergoing diagnostic studies, 68 +/- 22 minutes and 146 +/- 42 minutes following interventions using 6F sheaths, and 127 +/- 18 minutes and 219 +/- 37 minutes when interventions were performed using 7F sheaths. No patient developed a major hematoma or infection following the use of an Angioseal. There were 2 complications related to device deployment. One patient developed a 1.4-cm false aneurysm at the femoral artery puncture site that resolved spontaneously. A second patient required operation for vessel occlusion when an Angioseal was deployed in a markedly diseased femoral artery. These adverse events occurred early in our experience.\nThe Angioseal provides a secure method of achieving hemostasis following femoral artery puncture. It is easy to deploy, has a high level of patient satisfaction, and allows for early ambulation and hospital discharge. When simple guidelines are observed, the device can be safely used in the great majority of patients with peripheral vascular disease. It offers considerable advantages over the traditional method of manual compression.",

    "abstract": "Hemispheric neurologic symptoms, amaurosis fugax, and Hollenhorst plaques at eye examination are standard indications for carotid imaging to identify carotid artery occlusive disease (CAOD). Previous reports have suggested that other ocular findings, such as retinal artery occlusion and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, are associated with CAOD. However, the predictive value of ocular findings for the presence of CAOD is controversial. The purpose of this study was to define the predictive value of ocular symptoms and ophthalmologic examination in identifying significant CAOD.\nOver 3 years 145 patients were referred for carotid imaging on the basis of ocular indications in 160 eyes. Forty patients were excluded because of concurrent non-ocular indications for carotid imaging, leaving 105 patients referred exclusively for ocular indications to evaluate. Ophthalmologic history and eye examination were correlated with carotid duplex ultrasound findings.\nAmaurosis fugax was associated with a positive scan in 20.0% of carotid arteries (P =.022). Hollenhorst plaques at fundoscopic examination were associated with a positive scan in 18.2% of carotid arteries (P =.02). Ocular findings exclusive of Hollenhorst plaques were particularly poor predictors of CAOD, inasmuch as only 1 of 64 arteries (1.6%) had significant ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis (P =.022). Venous stasis retinopathy was the only ocular finding other than Hollenhorst plaques with any predictive value (1 of 5 scans positive; positive predictive value, 20.0%).\nOcular symptoms and findings are poor predictors of CAOD. Amaurosis fugax, Hollenhorst plaques, and venous stasis retinopathy demonstrated moderate predictive value, whereas all other ocular findings demonstrated no predictive value in identifying CAOD.",

    "abstract": "Although many studies have well established that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is beneficial in selected patients with severe carotid disease, only a few large studies have focused on the durability of the surgical procedure. Carotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has recently been proposed as a potential alternative to CEA. We analyzed the incidence of late occlusion and recurrent stenosis after CEA.\nOver 13 years 1000 patients underwent 1150 CEA procedures to treat symptomatic and asymptomatic high-grade carotid stenosis. CEA procedures involving either traditional CEA with patching (n = 302) or eversion CEA (n = 848) were all performed by the same surgeon, with patients under deep general anesthesia and cerebral protection involving continuous electroencephalographic monitoring for selective shunting. All patients underwent postoperative duplex ultrasound scanning and clinical follow-up at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. New neurologic events, late occlusions, and recurrent stenoses 50% or greater were recorded. Complete follow-up (mean, 6.2 years; range, 6-156 months) was obtained in 95% of patients (949 of 1000), for an overall average of 95% of procedures (1092 of 1150). Survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier life table method.\nPerioperative (30-day) mortality rate was 0.3% (3 of 1000), and stroke rate was 0.9% (11 of 1150), with a combined mortality and stroke rate of 1.2%. The incidence of late occlusion and recurrent stenosis 70% or greater was 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively, with a combined occlusion and restenosis rate of 1.1%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the rate of freedom from occlusion, restenosis 70% or greater, and combined occlusion and restenosis 70% or greater at 12 years was 99,4%, 99.5%, and 98.8%, respectively. Occlusion and restenosis developed asymptomatically.\nCEA is a low-risk procedure for treating severe symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid disease, with excellent long-term durability. Proponents of CAS should bear this in mind before considering CAS as a routine alternative to CEA.",

    "abstract": "We undertook this study to quantitate differences in the degree of calcification between symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques removed at carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and to determine associated extent of plaque macrophage infiltration, a histopathologic feature of plaque instability.\nCEA plaques (n = 48) were imaged at 1.25-mm intervals with spiral computed tomography (CT; 10-15 images per plaque). Indications for CEA were transient ischemic attack (n = 16), stroke (n = 5), amaurosis (n = 4), and critical asymptomatic stenosis (n = 23). The percent area calcification for each plaque was determined in spiral CT serial sections and averaged for each plaque. In 31 of 48 plaques macrophage infiltration was quantitated in corresponding histologic sections with immunohistochemical techniques.\nThe mean (+/- SD) age of patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques was 66 +/- 7 years vs 71 +/- 7 years, respectively, and degree of stenosis was 76% versus 82%, respectively (P =.05). Atherosclerosis risk factors were similar between groups. Percent plaque area calcification was twofold greater in asymptomatic versus symptomatic plaques (48% +/- 19% vs 24% +/- 20%, respectively; P <.05). At receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, 80% of symptomatic plaques were below and 87% of asymptomatic plaques were above a cutoff point of 30% plaque area calcification. Macrophage burden was greater in the symptomatic plaques than in the asymptomatic plaques (52% vs 23%; P <.03). A strong inverse relationship between the degree of plaque calcification and macrophage infiltration was found in critical carotid stenoses (r = -0.87; P <.001).\nSymptomatic plaques are less calcified and more inflamed than asymptomatic plaques. Regardless of clinical outcome, a strong inverse correlation was found between the extent of carotid plaque calcification and the intensity of plaque fibrous cap inflammation as determined by the degree of macrophage infiltration. Carotid plaque calcification is associated with plaque stability, and is a potential spiral CT in vivo quantitative marker for cerebrovascular ischemic event risk.",

    "abstract": "Few articles have dealt specifically with management of radiotherapy-induced supra-aortic trunk disease. We investigated the results of surgical and endovascular treatment of these lesions, and present our findings in a large series of patients.\nThe study was conducted at 11 centers. Over 10 years 64 patients with radiotherapy-induced supra-aortic trunk disease underwent surgical or endovascular treatment. Data were collected retrospectively in a consecutive cohort of patients, and were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method.\nMean patient age was 64.4 years. The indications for radiotherapy included breast cancer (30%), head and neck malignancies (50%), and lymphomas (19%). The mean interval between irradiation and arterial revascularization was 15.2 years. Thirteen of the 64 patients (20%) had asymptomatic disease, and 51 patients (80%) had symptomatic disease. Ninety-two stenotic or occlusive lesions were observed, which involved the common carotid artery (n = 62), the subclavian artery (n = 26), or the innominate artery (n = 4). Twenty-three patients (36%) had multiple supra-aortic trunk lesions, but only 8 patients underwent reconstruction of multiple supra-aortic trunks. Five patients (8%) underwent sternotomy for revascularization from the ascending aorta. Forty-seven patients required revascularization of a common carotid artery; procedures included bypass grafting (n = 30), angioplasty with stent placement (n = 13), carotid-carotid transposition (n = 2), and endarterectomy (n = 2). Fifteen patients underwent restoration of a subclavian artery. One patient died on postoperative day 5, of stroke after early occlusion of an intercarotid crossover bypass graft. Mean follow-up was 37 months (range, 2-120 months). Ten late deaths occurred during follow-up. The probability of survival at 4 years was 78.1% +/- 8.6%. During follow-up, 6 patients had stroke, 4 bypass occlusions occurred and 3 stenoses occurred in the revascularized arteries. At 4 years the probability of freedom from stroke was 85% +/- 8.8%. At 4 years the primary patency rate was 79.3% +/- 8.5% and the secondary patency rate was 87.9% +/- 7.2%.\nIn light of the context, the results of arterial revascularization to treat radiation-induced arterial lesions of the supra-aortic trunk are satisfactory.",

    "abstract": "There are few large studies in the literature that document the clinical outcome of an acute dissection of the distal thoracic aorta (ADDA), particularly since the advent of percutaneous techniques for therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of complications of ADDA. The goal of this study was to evaluate the outcome of ADDA with respect to medical, surgical, and percutaneous treatment over a 20-year period, and to use this information to estimate the benefit that future prophylactic therapy may yield.\nThe hospital records of all patients admitted with ADDA during the period of the study were reviewed retrospectively.\nThere were 119 patients who fit the criteria of ADDA. Medical management was performed in 92 patients, with an overall mortality in this group of 13% (12/92 patients). Major morbidity occurred in 34 of the 83 surviving patients managed nonoperatively. Percutaneous interventions consisting of aortic fenestration and branch vessel stenting in 5 patients had a mortality rate of 40% and was only effective in the treatment of isolated renal artery malperfusion. Twenty-two patients underwent aortic surgery for complications or risk of impending rupture. Postoperative mortality was 18% (4/22 patients). Significant risk factors for death were rupture, acute renal failure, mesenteric ischemia, and age >70. No patient who had surgical fenestration required reoperation on the tailored segment. On the basis of clinical outcomes, we estimate that a maximum of 37% of patients could benefit acutely from prophylactic treatment of ADDA with aortic stent grafts, and an additional 13% could benefit chronically from such prophylactic treatment.\nADDA remains a challenging clinical problem with many failures of medical, surgical, and percutaneous therapy. Surgery remains an effective therapeutic option in the treatment of complications of acute dissection of the distal thoracic aorta, and surgical aortic fenestration is a durable treatment for malperfusion. A minority of patients may benefit from prophylactic treatment of ADDA with thoracic stent grafts.",

    "abstract": "The advent of endovascular prostheses to treat descending thoracic aortic lesions offers an alternative approach in patients who are poor candidates for surgery. The development of this approach includes complications that are common to the endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms and some that are unique to thoracic endografting.\nWe conducted a retrospective review of 60 emergent and high-risk patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) and dissections treated with endovascular prostheses over 4 years under existing investigational protocols or on an emergent compassionate use basis.\nFifty-nine of the 60 patients received treatment, with one access failure. Thirty-five patients received treatment of TAAs. Four of these procedures were performed emergently because of active hemorrhage. Twenty-four patients with aortic dissections (16 acute, 8 chronic) also received treatment. Eight of the patients with acute dissection had active hemorrhage at the time of treatment. Three devices were used: AneuRx (Medtronic; n = 31), Talent (Medtronic; n = 27), and Excluder (Gore; n = 1). Nineteen secondary endovascular procedures were performed in 14 patients. Most were secondary to endoleak (14 of 19), most commonly caused by modular separation of overlapping devices (n = 8). Other endoleaks included 4 proximal or distal type I leaks and 2 undefined endoleaks. The remaining secondary procedures were performed to treat recurrent dissection (n = 1), pseudoaneurysm enlargement (n = 3), and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (n = 1). One patient underwent surgical repair of a retrograde ascending aortic dissection after endograft placement. Procedure-related mortality was 17% in the TAA group and 13% in the dissection group, including 2 acute retrograde dissections that resulted in death from cardiac tamponade. Overall mortality was 28% at 2-year follow-up.\nAlthough significant morbidity and mortality remain, endovascular repair of descending TAAs and dissections in patients at high-risk patients can be accomplished with acceptable outcomes compared with traditional open repair. The major cause for repeat intervention in these patients was endoleak, most commonly caused by device separation. Improved understanding of these complications may result in a decrease in secondary procedures, morbidity, and mortality in these patients. The need for secondary interventions in a significant number of patients underscores the necessity for continued surveillance.",

Three devices were used: AneuRx (Medtronic; n = 31), Talent (Medtronic; n = 27), and Excluder (Gore; n = 1). Nineteen secondary endovascular procedures were performed in 14 patients. Most were secondary to endoleak (14 of 19), most commonly caused by modular separation of overlapping devices (n = 8). Other endoleaks included 4 proximal or distal type I leaks and 2 undefined endoleaks. The remaining secondary procedures were performed to treat recurrent dissection (n = 1), pseudoaneurysm enlargement (n = 3), and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (n = 1). One patient underwent surgical repair of a retrograde ascending aortic dissection after endograft placement. Procedure-related mortality was 17% in the TAA group and 13% in the dissection group, including 2 acute retrograde dissections that resulted in death from cardiac tamponade. Overall mortality was 28% at 2-year follow-up.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of using computerized software-assisted centerline measurements for extensions and graft junctions during the selection of endograft components for modular aortic endografts in endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms.\nFrom April 1998 to December 2002, 289 modular aortic endografts were implanted at our institution. These included 248 grafts (prior to 2002, group 1) with components selected on the basis of manual caliper measurements from combined contrast computed tomography (CT) and marker-catheter arteriography data, and 41 grafts (2002, group 2) with components selected with the use of computerized software that allowed for centerline measurements on 3-dimensional reconstructions based on CT data. These 2 groups were compared for the number and type of extensions required per case. Seventeen other relevant variables were analyzed for their potential influence on selection of endograft components. These variables included age, gender, maximum aneurysm size, level of distal fixation, length and diameter at the fixation points, endograft manufacturer (make), and configuration. The significance of the observed differences was analyzed with a multivariate regression model, adjusting for potentially confounding preoperative measures.\nMultivariate analysis demonstrated that the number of right iliac extensions, left iliac extensions, total extensions, and total graft junctions was significantly reduced by the use of computerized software-assisted centerline measurements (group 2) compared with caliper measurements (group 1), independent of all other 17 preoperative variables. Notably, the mean number of required right iliac extensions was double in group 1 versus group 2.\nCenterline software-assisted measurements can significantly reduce the need for iliac extensions and, concomitantly, the number of required endograft junctions. On average, twice as many extensions were required for right iliac fixation when the manual caliper measurements were used compared with software-assisted measurements. These findings are highly relevant to issues of total endograft cost and long-term endograft integrity and focus attention on the tools that may need to be considered standards of care rather than optional for selection of endograft components.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to identify factors that lead to improvements in the results of endovascular aneurysm repair, with particular focus on new endograft design.\nWe analyzed data for patients enrolled in the European Collaborators on Stent Graft Techniques for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair (EUROSTAR) registry, and compared those for endografts now withdrawn from the market with those for endografts currently in use. Patients in whom a variety of endograft types were used in small numbers were excluded. Postoperative and long-term outcomes were initially compared with univariate analyses, and subsequently multivariate tests were used to adjust for baseline differences between the 2 groups. The main outcome measures were freedom from a variety of secondary interventions, aneurysm rupture, and death.\nSome 1224 patients received \"withdrawn\" endografts, and 2768 patients received \"current\" endografts. The 2 groups were generally similar, but patients with current devices were more often men, significantly older, more frequently unfit for open surgery, and had larger aneurysms with wider necks. Of no surprise, current endografts were also more often used by experienced (>60 previous cases) surgical teams (44% vs 20%; P <.0001). Thirty-day clinical outcomes were comparable in the 2 groups, although patients with withdrawn devices were less likely to have type II endoleak (9.2% vs 5.5%; P <.0001), and those with current devices had a shorter mean hospital stay (5.4 vs 6.8 days; P <.0001). At 3 years more patients with current devices were free from secondary transfemoral intervention (88.4% vs 76%; P <.0001) and conversion to open repair (95.4% vs 93.4%; P =.007). Aneurysm-related mortality at 3 years, defined as death due to aneurysm rupture or within 30 days of a secondary intervention, was also less frequent with current endografts (2.7% vs 4.4%; P =.02). Aneurysm rupture at 3 years was infrequent (0.8% vs 1.8%; P =.07). At multivariate analysis the use of current devices was a protective factor against late conversion to open repair (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.86; P =.014) and aneurysm-related death (hazard ratio, 0.51, 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.75; P =.0008). Larger aneurysm or neck diameter and shorter neck length were also associated with late conversion to open repair; larger aneurysm diameter, older age, and unfitness for open surgery were predictive of aneurysm-related death.\nModern endograft design has improved the results of endovascular aneurysm repair.",

    "abstract": "Our purpose was to examine the impact of the introduction of endovascular treatment on the early outcomes of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) during 2 consecutive time periods at a single institution.\nThe hospital records of a single tertiary care center from 1997 to 2004 were retrospectively reviewed, and 36 consecutive patients who underwent treatment for acute ruptured AAA were identified. They were divided into 19 (53%) patients who were all treated with conventional open surgery from 1997 to 2001 (early) and 17 (47%) patients who were treated either with open (n = 4, 24%) or endovascular (n = 13, 76%) methods from 2002 to 2004 (late). All endovascular repairs were performed with commercially available bifurcated devices. Outcome measures included death, major complications, disposition at discharge (home or extended care facility), procedure time, blood loss, and hospital length of stay.\nAge, sex, and AAA size were similar between the 2 groups. Perioperative mortality in the early and late periods were 37% versus 12%, respectively (P =.13); rates of major complications were 84% versus 65%, respectively (P =.26); and discharge to home rather than extended care facility was 32% versus 59%, respectively (P =.18). Median procedure times (275 vs 149 minutes, P <.01), blood loss (3800 vs 138 mL, P <.0001), and length of stay (18 vs 6 days, P <.05) were all higher during the early period than in the late period.\nThis preliminary study suggests that introduction of endovascular therapies may be potentially beneficial in the overall treatment scheme of patients with ruptured AAAs. However, longer follow-up and larger cohorts are needed to better establish its feasibility and efficacy compared with conventional open surgical repair.",

    "abstract": "The standard conduit in infrainguinal arterial bypass grafting, the great saphenous vein, is often unavailable. Arm and small saphenous veins are used as alternative conduits; yet both are deficient in length to accommodate femorocrural bypasses as a single conduit. In light of its high prevalence, the Giacomini vein harvested in continuity with the small saphenous vein may offer the latter extra length, promoting their combination into a single conduit able to meet the needs of infrainguinal reconstruction, particularly in lengthy infrainguinal bypass grafting. The Giacomini vein merits consideration when arterial reconstruction is performed in proximity to its anatomic course.",

Imaging studies revealed an ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm (AAP), which was repaired with a 5-mm polyester patch, with circulatory arrest and cardiopulmonary bypass. Intraoperative cultures of the AAP grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and the pseudoaneurysm recurred after 6 weeks despite intravenously administered antibiotic therapy. A 28.5-mm x 3.3-cm Gore Excluder aortic cuff was deployed in the ascending aorta through a left axillary artery cutdown with use of combined transesophageal echocardiography and fluoroscopy. In addition, controlled hypotension and asystole were established with administration of adenosine to facilitate precise device deployment. Postoperative imaging with transesophageal echocardiography and magnetic resonance angiography revealed complete resolution of the AAP, and the patient had done well at 7-month follow-up. Treatment of a mycotic aortic pseudoaneurysm with an endoprosthesis in a patient without other treatment alternatives can be performed safely, with acceptable short-term results.",

These procedures are generally performed under cardiopulmonary bypass, and review of the literature reveals an evolution in management of this disease from 2-stage to single-stage procedures. We report the case of a 45-year-old woman with an intravenous leiomyoma with intracardiac extension after presenting with syncopal symptoms. The intravenous tumor and its supradiaphragmatic extension were ultimately resected via laparotomy without the need for cardiopulmonary bypass. Distal control was achieved by passing an occluding balloon catheter above the tumor through a venotomy with fluoroscopic guidance and echocardiography, thus enabling protected tumor extraction through the intra-abdominal inferior vena cava. In selected patients, we believe use of endovascular techniques combined with proper preoperative imaging can safely permit single-stage resection of these tumors via laparotomy without cardiopulmonary bypass.",

    "abstract": "Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) resolution involves fibrinolysis, neovascularization, and fibrosis. We hypothesized that promoting neovascularization would accelerate DVT resolution.\nA rat model of stasis DVT was produced with proximal ligation of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and all visible tributaries. One microg of interferon inducible protein (IP-10; angiostatic chemokine), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; pro-angiogenic cytokine), epithelial neutrophil activating protein (ENA-78; pro-angiogenic chemokine), or saline solution control was injected into the IVC after ligation, and then via tail vein injection daily until sacrifice at either 4 or 8 days. Peripheral blood counts were measured, and thrombus weight was recorded at sacrifice. Laser Doppler in vivo imaging was used to estimate post-thrombotic IVC blood flow. Immunohistologic assessment of the thrombosed IVC for polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), monocytes (ED-1), and laminin (neovascular channels) was performed or the thrombus was separated from the IVC and assayed for keratinocyte cytokine (KC), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), bFGF with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and total collagen with a direct colorimetric assay.\nPeripheral blood and intrathrombus PMNs and monocytes were not significantly different in the treated or control rats. There were no differences in any measure at 4 days. At 8 days, thrombus neovascularity, but not weight or collagen content, was increased in rats treated with bFGF or ENA-78 compared with control rats (17.6 +/- 0.93, 16.2 +/- 0.97 vs 13.2 +/- 0.79; channels/5 high-power fields (hpf; n = 6-10; P <.05). Post DVT IVC blood flow was significantly increased in bFGF-treated rats but not in rats treated with IP-10 or ENA-78, as compared with control rats. Rats treated with ENA-78 had increased intrathrombus bFGF compared with control rats (85 +/- 27 pg/mg protein vs 20 +/- 6 pg/mg protein; n = 6; P <.05), but other mediators were not significantly different in treated rats compared with control rats.\nPro-angiogenic compounds increase thrombus neovascularization, but this does not correlate with smaller or less fibrotic DVT. Mechanisms other than neovascularization may be more important to hasten DVT dissolution. Clinical relevance Improved therapy for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) will ideally increase the rate of thrombus dissolution and eliminate the bleeding risks of anticoagulation. This study evaluated promoting DVT neovascularization with angiogenic chemokines, and, while successful by experimental measures, this did not translate into smaller DVT. Solely promoting thrombus neovascularization will not likely speed resolution.",

Mechanisms other than neovascularization may be more important to hasten DVT dissolution. Clinical relevance Improved therapy for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) will ideally increase the rate of thrombus dissolution and eliminate the bleeding risks of anticoagulation. This study evaluated promoting DVT neovascularization with angiogenic chemokines, and, while successful by experimental measures, this did not translate into smaller DVT. Solely promoting thrombus neovascularization will not likely speed resolution.",

    "abstract": "Different vascular beds show substantial variation in their susceptibilities for development of vascular disease like atherosclerosis, and thereby exhibit a variety of different clinical presentations. Yet, the underlying mechanism of this heterogeneity is not well defined. Recent evidence suggests a role for the vasa vasorum (VV) in vascular disease. We hypothesized that there is a differential distribution structure of adventitial VV in different vascular beds. Hence, the current study was designed to characterize and compare the structure of the adventitial VV in the coronary and the peripheral circulation.\nSamples of vessels from different vascular beds were obtained from 6 female crossbred domestic pigs. The samples were scanned using micro-computed tomography, and the images reconstructed and analyzed to characterize VV architecture, including vessel wall area, VV count, VV density, intravessel spatial distribution, mean diameter of first- and second-order VVs and the ratio of second- to first-order VVs.\nThere were significant differences in VV density among different vascular beds. Density was highest in coronary arteries (2.91 +/- 0.26 vessels/mm2, P <.05, vs renal, carotid, and femoral arteries), intermediate in renal arteries (1.45+/- 0.22 vessels/mm2, P <.05, vs femoral artery) and carotid arteries (0.64 +/- 0.08 vessels/mm2, P <.05, vs femoral artery), and lowest in femoral arteries (0.23 +/- 0.05 vessels/mm2 ). A similar pattern for the ratio of second- to first-order VV was also observed. Random intravessel spatial distribution of VVs was seen in all vascular beds.\nThe current study demonstrates a differential structure of the adventitial VV in different vascular beds. This intra- and intervessel heterogeneity in VV anatomy is a phenotypic variability that might determine a differential local response to systemic risk factors and, thereby, variable propensity for vascular disease among different vascular beds.",

    "abstract": "Regulator of G protein signaling 5 (RGS5), an inhibitor of Galpha(q) and Galpha(i) activation, was recently identified among genes highly expressed in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of aorta but not vena cava. This finding prompted the hypothesis that RGS5 provides long-term G protein inhibition specific to normal arterial SMC populations and that loss of expression may in turn contribute to arterial disease.\nTo test this hypothesis we characterized RGS5 gene expression throughout the vasculature of nonhuman primates to determine whether RGS5 was restricted to arteries in other vascular beds and whether expression was altered in arterial disease.\nIn situ hybridization localized RGS5 message to medial SMCs of peripheral arteries, including carotid, iliac, mammary, and renal arteries, but not accompanying veins. SMCs of many small arteries and arterioles also expressed RGS5, including glomerular afferent arterioles critical to blood pressure regulation. Differential expression persisted in culture, inasmuch as RGS5 message was significantly higher in SMCs derived from arteries than from veins at real-time polymerase chain reaction. It was remarkable that the only major arterial bed lacking RGS5 was the coronary circulation. In atherosclerotic peripheral arteries RGS5 was expressed in medial SMCs, but was sharply downregulated in plaque SMCs.\nThese data identify RGS5 as a new member of a short list of genes uniquely expressed in peripheral arteries but not coronary arteries. Persistence of an arterial pattern of RGS5 expression in culture and lack of expression in coronary arteries support a unique SMC phenotype fixed by distinct lineage or differentiation pathways. The association between loss of expression and arterial wall disease has prompted the new hypothesis that prolonged inhibition by RGS5 of vasoactive or trophic G protein signaling is critical to normal peripheral artery function.",

    "abstract": "Our previous study demonstrated that high flow conditions stimulated cell proliferation in the aortic wall in a rat model of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and we speculated that there is a possible relation between medial cell density and aortic wall integrity. In the present study we delivered the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) gene to the aortic wall of a rat AAA model and evaluated the effects of growth factor-enhanced smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation on aneurysm progression.\nAAA was induced in rats by means of infusion of porcine pancreatic elastase. Immediately after elastase infusion the abdominal aorta was filled with an expression plasmid vector containing the bFGF gene (bFGF group) or LacZ gene (control group); then gene transfer to the aortic wall was carried out with an in vivo electroporation method. The animals were killed 7 days after treatment, and the aneurysm was measured. The numbers of SMCs, macrophages, and endothelial cells were counted with immunostaining, and cell replication was evaluated with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining.\nAneurysm diameter in the bFGF group was significantly smaller than that in the control group (4.6 +/- 0.3 mm vs 6.5 +/- 1.4 mm; P <.01). The numbers of medial SMCs and BrdU-incorporated cells in the bFGF group were significantly greater than those in the control group (SMC, 101 +/- 34 per high-power field [hpf] vs 80 +/- 31/hpf; P <.05, BrdU, 107 +/- 63/hpf vs 50 +/- 33/hpf; P <.05), whereas no difference was detected in the numbers of macrophages and endothelial cells between the 2 groups.\nDelivery of bFGF to the aortic wall induced significant enhancement of medial SMC proliferation, without an increase in inflammatory infiltration, then successfully limited aneurysm enlargement. These findings suggest that increased medial cellularity inhibits aneurysm formation, which possibly offers a clue for developing a new strategy for treatment of AAAs.",

    "abstract": "Abbe and Payr introduced vascular techniques and devices to facilitate vessel anastomosis over a century ago. Obora published the idea of a sutureless vascular anastomosis with use of magnetic rings in 1978. The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of a new magnetic device to perform a side-to-side arteriovenous anastomosis in a dog model.\nMale fox hounds (25 kg) were treated preoperatively and daily postoperatively with clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) and aspirin. The femoral artery and vein were exposed unilaterally in 3 dogs and bilaterally in 4 dogs (n = 11 anastomoses). A 4-mm arteriotomy was performed, and 1 oval magnet 0.5 mm thick was inserted into the lumen of the artery and a second magnet was applied external to the artery, compressing and stabilizing the arterial wall to create a magnetic port. An identical venous magnetic port was created with another pair of oval magnets. When the 2 ports were allowed to approach each other, they self-aligned and magnetically coupled to complete the arteriovenous anastomosis. Patency was assessed for the first hour with direct observation, again after 9 weeks with duplex ultrasound scanning, and at 10 weeks under direct open observation. The anastomoses were explanted after 10 weeks. Hydrodynamic resistance was measured ex vivo on the final 8 anastomoses by measuring the pressure drop across an anastomosis with a known flow rate.\nAfter implantation, very high flow created visible turbulence and palpable vibration. All 11 anastomoses were patent under direct observation and palpation. Ten of 11 anastomoses were clearly patent on duplex scans, and patency of 1 anastomosis was questionable. Hydrodynamic resistance averaged 0.73 +/- 0.33 mm Hg min/mL (mean +/- SEM).\nVascular anastomoses performed with magnets demonstrated feasibility; exhibited 100% patency after 10 weeks in a dog arteriovenous shunt model; lacked apparent aneurysm or other potentially catastrophic failure; demonstrated remodeling of the vessel wall after several weeks to incorporate the magnets, making the magnetic force unnecessary; and warrants further study in vessels with different sizes, flow rates, and locations.\nWe present a magnet-based device used to perform side-to-side peripheral vascular anastomoses. Its advantages include the ability to anastomose vessels without requiring circumferential surgical exposure. Vascular anastomosis performed with these magnets demonstrated 100% patency in the dog, lacked apparent aneurysm or other potentially catastrophic failure, and demonstrated remodeling of the vessel wall after several weeks, to incorporate the magnets, making indefinite retention of field strength unnecessary. This technique could enable minimally invasive procedures, such as complex reconstructive and revascularizing surgery, and warrants further study in vessels with different sizes, flow rates, and locations.",

    "abstract": "Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the greater saphenous vein (GSV; \"closure\") is a relatively new option for treatment of venous reflux. However, our initial enthusiasm for this minimally invasive technique has been tempered by our preliminary experience with its potentially lethal complication, deep venous thrombosis (DVT).\nSeventy-three lower extremities were treated in 66 patients with GSV reflux, between April 2003 and February 2004. There were 48 (73%) female patients and 18 (27%) male patients, with ages ranging from 26 to 88 years (mean, 62 +/- 14 years). RFA was combined with stab avulsion of varicosities in 55 (75%) patients and subfascial ligation of perforator veins in 6 (8%) patients. An ATL HDI 5000 scanner with linear 7-4 MHz probe and the SonoCT feature was used for GSV mapping and procedure guidance in all procedures. GSV diameter determined the size of the RFA catheter used. Veins less than 8 mm in diameter were treated with a 6F catheter (n = 54); an 8F catheter was used for veins greater than 8 mm in diameter (n = 19). The GSV was cannulated at the knee level. The tip of the catheter was positioned within 1 cm of the origin of the inferior epigastric vein (first GSV tributary). All procedures were carried out according to manufacturer guidelines.\nAll patients underwent venous duplex ultrasound scanning 2 to 30 days (mean, 10 +/- 6 days) after the procedure. The duplex scans documented occlusion of the GSV in 70 limbs (96%). In addition, DVT was found in 12 limbs (16%).

Four patients were treated with enoxaparin on an ambulatory basis. None of these patients had pulmonary embolism. Initially 3 patients with floating common femoral vein clots underwent inferior vena cava filter placement. Of the 19 limbs treated with the 8F RFA catheter, GSV clot extension developed in 5 (26%), compared with 7 of 54 (13%) limbs treated with the 6F RFA catheter (P =.3). No difference was found between the occurrence of DVT in patients who underwent the combined procedure (RFA and varicose vein excision) compared with patients who underwent GSV RFA alone (P =.7). No statistically significant differences were found in age or gender of patients with or without postoperative DVT (P = NS).\nPatients who underwent combined GSV RFA and varicose vein excision did not demonstrate a higher occurrence of postoperative DVT compared with patients who underwent RFA alone. Early postoperative duplex scans are essential, and should be mandatory in all patients undergoing RFA of the GSV.",

    "abstract": "In patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), abnormal muscle metabolism and impaired oxygen delivery distal to the arterial occlusions may contribute to the exercise limitation observed in this population. Muscle tissue hemoglobin saturation (StO2), measured with near-infrared spectroscopy, reflects the relative contributions of oxygen delivery and oxygen use. Thus differences in the kinetics of StO2 in response to exercise may yield important insight into the potential mechanisms associated with the PAD exercise impairment. The purposes of this study were to characterize the muscle oxygenation responses in patients with PAD and in healthy control subjects at the onset of exercise, and to compare the kinetics of StO2 desaturation. We hypothesized that at the onset of exercise the kinetics of StO2 desaturation would be slowed in PAD compared with control responses.\nSix patients with PAD and 6 healthy control subjects from a university center were examined in a prospective cross-sectional analysis that evaluated the desaturation kinetics of StO2 at the onset of walking exercise. On separate visits subjects performed graded treadmill exercise and 3 constant work rate treadmill tests equivalent to approximately 60% (low), approximately 80% (medium), and 100% (peak) of their peak exercise work rate. Gastrocnemious muscle StO2 response profiles (InSpectra tissue spectrometer) were measured at rest and across the rest to exercise transition. Muscle StO2 responses were characterized by an exponential mathematical model. The end point value was taken as the time constant of StO2 desaturation after onset of exercise (ie, equivalent to time to reach approximately 63% of StO2 decrease).\nThe patients with PAD and the control subjects were of similar age and activity level. The qualitative patterns of StO2 responses at onset of exercise were also similar between patients and control subjects at all work rates. However, the kinetic time constants of StO2 desaturation were prolonged in patients with PAD versus control subjects (averaged time constant across all work rates, 21.9 +/- 9.4 seconds vs 4.9 +/- 2.2 seconds; P <.01).\nThe slowed muscle StO2 kinetics in PAD are consistent with an impairment in muscle oxygen use at the onset of walking exercise. Impaired muscle metabolism may contribute to the altered physiologic responses to exercise and to exercise impairment in patients with PAD.",

So far, these pathologies are primarily treated conservatively, surgical revascularization being an option only after recurrent thromboembolic neurologic episodes or continuous aneurysm growth. Successful endovascular treatment strategies with covered stents have been reported in patients with ICA dissections. However, no long-term results are published so far. Herein, we report our experience of a combined conventional and endovascular repair of ICA dissections under reversed flow and their respective long-term results.\nIn a prospective evaluation of clinical and morphologic outcome of 6 patients with carotid artery dissections, 2 patients were treated for continuous aneurysm growth and 4 patients for high-grade ICA stenoses with recurrent thromboembolic episodes during a 6-month follow-up period. A 6-mm polytetrafluoroethylene Hemobahn endoprosthesis was inserted under reversed flow of the internal carotid artery.\nNo perioperative strokes were observed; one TIA occurred, lasting less than 3 hours; no peripheral cranial nerve injuries or deaths were observed. No occlusions, hemodynamically significant stenosis, or recurrent neurologic symptoms were seen during follow-up, which ranged from 6 to 54 months (mean, 38.3 months).\nOpen endovascular repair of the ICA of symptomatic patients with dissections with a 6-mm covered endoprosthesis is a safe alternative to conventional surgery, with excellent long-term patency.",

    "abstract": "Transfemoral carotid artery stenting (CAS), with or without distal protection, is associated with risk for cerebral and peripheral embolism and access site complications. To establish cerebral protection before crossing the carotid lesion and to avert transfemoral access complications, the present study was undertaken to evaluate a transcervical approach for CAS with carotid flow reversal for cerebral protection.\nFifty patients underwent CAS through a transcervical approach. All patients with symptoms had greater than 60% internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, and all patients without symptoms had greater than 80% ICA stenosis. Twenty-one patients (42%) had symptomatic disease or ipsilateral stroke, and 8 patients (16%) had contralateral stroke. Four patients (8%) had recurrent stenosis, 7 patients (14%) had contralateral ICA occlusion, and 1 patient (2%) had undergone previous neck radiation. Twenty-seven procedures (54%) were performed with local anesthesia, and 23 (46%) with general anesthesia. Using a cervical cutdown, flow was reversed in the ICA by occluding the common carotid artery and establishing a carotid-jugular vein fistula. Pre-dilation was selective, and 8-mm to 10-mm self-expanding stents were deployed and post-dilated with 5-mm to 6-mm balloons in all cases.\nThe procedure was technically successful in all patients, without significant residual stenoses. No strokes or deaths occurred. There was 1 wound complication (2%). All patients were discharged within 2 days of surgery. Mean flow reversal time was 21.4 minutes (range, 9-50 minutes). Carotid flow reversal was not tolerated in 2 patients (4%). Early in the experience, carotid flow reversal was not possible in 1 patient, and there were 1 major and 3 minor common carotid artery dissections, which resolved after stent placement. One intraoperative transient ischemic attack (2%) occurred in 1 patient in whom carotid flow was not reversed, and 1 patient with a contralateral ICA occlusion had a contralateral transient ischemic attack. At 1 to 12 months of follow-up, all patients remained asymptomatic, and all but 1 stent remained patent.\nTranscervical CAS with carotid flow reversal is feasible and safe. It can be done with the patient under local anesthesia, averts the complications of the transfemoral approach, and eliminates the increased complexity and cost of cerebral protection devices. Transcervical CAS is feasible when the transfemoral route is impossible or contraindicated, and may be the procedure of choice in a subset of patients in whom carotid stenting is indicated.",

Of these patients, 67.5% had experienced a previous neurologic event and 32.5% exhibited no symptoms. MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 48 hours before surgery. Histopathologic analysis (stable or unstable) and immunohistochemistry (macrophage count, T lymphocytes, activated T lymphocytes) were carried out on the plaques.\nMean MMP-2 and MMP-9 serum concentrations in the population studied were 1138.27 +/- 326.08 ng/mL and 1026.10 +/- 412.90 ng/mL, respectively. MMP-2 levels were significantly higher in patients with symptoms compared with patients without symptoms (1247.30 +/- 276.80 ng/mL vs 911.80 +/- 311.84 ng/mL; P =.001). MMP-9 was also significantly higher in the symptomatic group (1026.10 +/- 412.90 ng/mL vs 377.84 +/- 164.08 ng/mL; P =.001) and in patients with unstable plaques compared with those with stable plaques (1006.98 +/- 447.09 ng/mL vs 496.16 +/- 292.78 ng/mL; P =.001). In addition, we found a strong association between elevated MMP-9 concentration and presence of macrophages in plaque (Spearman rho, 0.45; P =.004). At logistic regression analysis, variables that best predicted the presence of unstable plaque were a previous neurologic event and MMP-9 level greater than 607 ng/mL (sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 92%; negative predictive value, 94.7%; positive predictive value, 93%).\nElevated MMP-9 concentration is associated with carotid plaque instability and the presence of macrophages, factors that indicate increased risk for a neurological event. Determination of this gelatinase may enable identification of high-risk subgroups of patients with carotid artery stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Aspirin therapy is usually continued throughout the perioperative period to reduce the risk for thromboembolic stroke and myocardial infarction after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Aspirin irreversibly binds cyclooxygenase-1, thereby reducing platelet aggregation for the lifetime of each platelet. However, recent research from this unit has shown that aggregation in response to arachidonic acid increases significantly, but transiently, during CEA, which suggests that the anti-platelet effect of aspirin is temporarily reversed. The purpose of the current study was to determine when this phenomenon occurs and to identify the possible mechanisms involved.\nPlatelet aggregation was measured in platelet-rich plasma from 41 patients undergoing CEA who were stabilized with 150 mg of aspirin daily. Blood was taken at 8 time points: before anesthesia, after anesthesia, before heparinization, 3 minutes after heparinization, 3 minutes after shunt insertion, 10 minutes after flow restoration, 4 hours postoperatively, and 24 hours postoperatively. Platelet aggregation was also measured at similar times in a group of 18 patients undergoing peripheral angioplasty without general anesthesia.\nAll patient platelets were effectively inhibited by aspirin at the start of the operation. There was a significant intraoperative increase in platelet response to arachidonic acid in both groups of patients, which occurred within 3 minutes of administration of unfractionated heparin. In the CEA group this resulted in a greater than 10-fold increase in mean aggregation, to 5 mmol/L of arachidonic acid (5 mmol/L), rising from 3.9% +/- 2.2% preoperatively to 45.1% +/- 29.3% after administration of heparin ( P <.0001). This increased aggregation persisted into the early postoperative period, but by 24 hours post operation aggregation had returned to near preoperative values. Aggregation in response to other platelet agonists (adenosine diphosphate, thrombin receptor agonist peptide) showed only a small increase at the same time, which could be accounted for by a parallel increase in the level of spontaneous aggregation.\nAdministration of heparin significantly increases platelet aggregation in response to arachidonic acid, despite adequate inhibition by aspirin administered preoperatively. This apparent reversal in anti-platelet activity persisted into the immediate early postoperative period, and could explain why a small proportion of patients are at increased risk for acute cardiovascular events after major vascular surgery, despite aspirin therapy.",

This study was carried out to define the limitations and applicability of this technique in the treatment of aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).\nFrom November 2000 to February 2004, 150 patients with AAA (n = 130) or AIOD (n = 20) were prospectively included in the study. The procedure consisted in a standard aneurysmorrhaphy or bypass procedure performed through a video assisted left minilombotomy.The main outcomes measured were mortality, complications, operative time, aortic cross-clamp time, time to solid diet, and length of intensive care unit and hospital stay.\nOperative mortality was 0.7 %. Nonfatal postoperative complications occurred in 12 patients (8%). Conversion to a standard procedure was necessary in 3 patients. Mean operative time was 207 +/- 57 minutes (AAA) and 224 +/- 55 minutes (AIOD). Mean aortic cross-clamp time was 76 +/- 26 minutes (AAA) and 48 +/- 21 minutes (AIOD). Median resumption of regular diet was 2 days. Median length of stay in the intensive care unit was 1 day and in the hospital 8 days.\nOur results suggest that MIRPA is a safe and effective minimally invasive procedure in the treatment of infrarenal aortic disease.",

    "abstract": "We describe our initial experience of total laparoscopic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.\nBetween February 2002 and September 2003, we performed 30 total laparoscopic AAA repairs in 27 men and 3 women. Median age was 71.5 years (range, 46-85 years). Median aneurysm size was 51.5 mm (range, 30-79 mm). American Society of Anesthesiologists class of patients was II, III and IV in 10, 19, and 1 cases, respectively. We performed total laparoscopic endoaneurysmorrhaphy and aneurysm exclusion in 27 and 3 patients, respectively. We used the laparoscopic transperitoneal left retrocolic approach in 27 patients. We operated on 2 patients via a tranperitoneal left retrorenal approach and 1 patient via a retroperitoneoscopic approach.\nWe implanted tube grafts and bifurcated grafts in 11 and 19 patients, respectively. Two minilaparotomies were performed. In 1 case, exposure via a retroperitoneal approach was difficult and, in another case, distal aorta was extremely calcified. Median operative time was 290 minutes (range, 160-420 minutes). Median aortic clamping time was 78 minutes (range, 35-230 minutes). Median blood loss was 1680 cc (range, 300-6900 cc). In our early experience, 2 patients died of myocardial infarction. Ten major nonlethal postoperative complications were observed in 8 patients: 4 transcient renal insufficiencies, 2 cases of lung atelectasis, 1 bowel obstruction, 1 spleen rupture, 1 external iliac artery dissection, and 1 iliac hematoma. Others patients had an excellent recovery with rapid return to general diet and ambulation. Median hospital stay was 9 days (range, 8-37 days). With a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 0.5-20 months), patients had a complete recovery and all grafts were patent.\nThese preliminary results show that total laparoscopic AAA repair is feasible and worthwhile for patients once the learning curve is overcome. However, prior training and experience in laparoscopic aortic surgery are needed to perform total laparoscopic AAA repair. Despite these encouraging results, a greater experience and further evaluation are required to ensure the real benefit of this technique compared with open AAA repair.",

    "abstract": "The endovascular management of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) relies on accurate preoperative imaging for proper patient selection and operative planning. Three-dimensional (3-D) computed tomography (CT) with reformatted images perpendicular to blood flow has gained popularity as a method of AAA assessment and image-based planning before endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The current study was undertaken to determine the interobserver agreement of AAA measurements obtained with axial CT and reformatted 3-D CT and to compare the consistency of the 2 methods in selecting patients for EVAR.\nEight observers assessed the axial CT and reformatted 3-D CT scans for 5 patients with AAAs to determine whether the patients were candidates for EVAR. 3-D CT with multiplanar reformatted images was performed by Medical Media Systems (MMS). Each observer measured the length and diameter of the proximal neck, maximal AAA, aortic bifurcation, common iliac diameter, and aortic angulation. The proximal neck and common iliac arteries were also assessed for thrombus, calcification, and tortuosity. Agreement of the measurements on axial CT scans was compared with those on MMS CT scans by calculating the kappa statistic. Complete agreement was defined as kappa = 1.0. The limits of agreement between observers were also calculated.\nThe cumulative interobserver agreement of MMS CT scans (kappa =.81) was greater than for axial CT scans (kappa =.59). The kappa value for each of the diameter measurements was greater with the MMS CT scans. In 79% of cases the observers' measurements were less than 2 mm from the mean with MMS CT, compared with 59% for axial CT. The kappa value for deciding whether a patient was an endograft candidate on the basis of aortic neck was greater with the MMS CT (0.92 vs 0.63). The limits of agreement between observers were also better with the MMS CT.\nThe interobserver agreement in planning EVAR is significantly better with MMS CT compared with traditional axial CT. The routine use of MMS CT appears justified before EVAR to improve the accuracy and consistency of patient selection.",

Body weight was higher (P <.001), and elevated plasma lipid levels (59% vs 43%; P =.042) and use of nicotine (47% vs 29%; P =.015) more frequent in the octogenarians. Baseline aneurysm size, procedure-related data, and hospital stay were comparable between groups. Aneurysm-related mortality was 0% in the study group and 0.7% in the control group (P =.740). Systemic complications occurred in 22% (SG) versus 11% (CG) (P =.035), owing to a rise in serum creatinine concentration greater than 30% of baseline in 14% in the octogenarian group (vs 5% in the CG; P =.048). Groin lymphoceles developed in 12% (SG) versus 2% (CG; P =.013). Technical success was 96% (SG) versus 98% (CG; P =.408), and clinical success was 86% versus 90% (P =.269). No aneurysm rupture occurred during follow-up, and aneurysm-related adverse events were comparable between groups. The estimated risk for any type of endoleak (2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-4.2; P =.023) or type II endoleak (2.1; 95% CI, 1.0-4.3; P = 0.51) was higher in the study group versus the control group; however, this did not affect secondary procedure rates (SG 16% vs CG 12%; estimated risk, SG vs CG,: 1.5; 95% CI, 0.6-3.6; P = 0.420) or aneurysm remodeling (97.2% combined aneurysm sac stabilization or decrease in both groups; P =.592). Aneurysm enlargement occurred in 2.8% (SG 1 vs CG 4; P =.592).\nElective EVAR in octogenarians appears safe and effective over midterm follow-up, with a temporary decrease in renal function (14%) and postoperative lymphoceles (12%) being the most common postoperative adverse events. Advanced chronologic age is not associated with diminished procedural outcome, clinical success, or postoperative survival, compared with younger age. Because of low perioperative mortality and high procedural success, EVAR may be the preferred approach to abdominal aortic aneurysm treatment in selected elderly patients.",

    "abstract": "Persistent endoleaks are a common problem following endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms, and the best method of treatment has been an issue of debate. Some experimental evidence has suggested that coiling may not be an effective method because it allows transmission of pressure across the coils with continued expansion of the sac. We reviewed our experience with endoleak coiling to assess the degree of clinical success of this treatment.\nA retrospective review of patients with type I or type II endoleaks treated solely by coiling over a 7-year period (1997-2003) was performed. All endoleaks had been observed for at least 6 months prior to intervention to detect spontaneous resolution. All coils were delivered by selective catheterization of the endoleaks. For Type II endoleaks, the branches were all coiled at their junction with the sac when feasible and the endoleak cavity was packed. Clinical success was defined as cessation of endoleak on follow-up computed tomography as well as no further aneurysmal growth (> or =5mm minor axis).\nTwenty-eight patients had their endoleaks treated only with coils. There were 22 Ancure, 2 Excluder, 2 AneuRx, and 2 Lifepath endografts in this patient cohort. Procedural morbidity was 0%. Mean follow-up after coiling for all patients was 18 months (range, 1-60 months) while mean follow-up for patients with a type I endoleak was 24 months. Clinical success was achieved in 15 of 19 (79%) patients with type II endoleaks and 8 of 9 (89%) patients with type I. Three patients, all with type I endoleak, required more than 1 episode of coiling, while 2 others, both with type II lumbar endoleaks, required repeat angiography due to inability to access the leak during the first attempt. There were 2 proximal and 6 distal type I endoleaks (2 aortic, 6 iliac) successfully treated while the type II successes included 8 inferior mesenteric artery and 7 sole lumbar endoleaks. Five patients continued to show evidence of endoleak over time: 2 endoleaks were associated with aneurysm growth leading to conversion in 1 patient, 2 patients with type II endoleaks are stable, and the sole type I endoleak with continued perigraft flow has shown significant shrinkage of the sac and continues to be observed 18 months later. No ruptures were noted during follow-up.\nCoiling as the sole method of endoleak management may be a suitable treatment option in selected patients. Clinical success can be expected in over 80% of patients with type II and select type I endoleaks, with minimal morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular stent-graft (ESG) repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has emerged as an alternative to open surgery. The role of ESG in patients with challenging medical and anatomic problems remains an area of general debate. This study reviews an experience with stent grafts to treat patients with AAA and atheromatous embolization syndrome (AES) presenting with chronic distal embolization (CDE).\nOver a 5-year period 660 patients with AAA were treated with aortic stent grafts. Patients with AAA and ischemic ulcerations or toe gangrene due to CDE despite palpable foot pulses were investigated for successful aneurysm exclusion, resolution of ischemic symptoms, complications and survival. Follow-up averaged 15.3 +/- 14.9 months (range, 1 to 60 months).\nNineteen patients had AAA and manifestations of CDE. The population (16 males/3 females) had a mean age of 79 +/- 7 years and mean aneurysm diameter of 5.5 cm. Renal insufficiency was present in 5/19 (26 %). Ischemia presented as ischemic ulcers (16/19 [84.2%]) or toe gangrene (3/19 [15.8%]). Stent grafts included 6 aortouniiliac and 13 bifurcated devices. Exclusion was achieved in all but 2 patients who had type II lumbar endoleaks. At 30-day postoperative follow-up, mortality was 0 % and resolution of CDE/ischemia was noted in 2 of 19 (10.5%) patients. Eight of 9 patients with follow-up of 1 year had complete resolution of their ischemic symptoms, with no recurrent manifestations of AES. Complications included progression of renal insufficiency over an 18-month period in 1 patient and an unstable expanding pararenal aortic neck in 1 patient. Foot ischemia persisted at 1 year in a patient with severe coexisting thoracic aortic disease despite successful AAA exclusion. Six (31.6%) patients died during a mean follow-up of 15.3 months from causes unrelated to their AAA.\nOn the basis of this experience, stent-graft repair of AAA and CDE may be an effective strategy to prevent future embolization. Recognition of coexisting thoracic aortic disease is essential. ESG does not address the extremely high morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular causes in this population.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the differences in outcome related to initial management of aortic endograft limb occlusion (ELO).\nDuring a 7-year period, 823 endovascular aneurysm repairs (EVARs) resulted in 25 ELOs in 22 patients. The initial management and outcome of these ELOs were reviewed. Median follow-up after ELO was 24.2 +/- 16.8 months.\nInitial EVARs included both unsupported unibody (n = 5) and supported modular (n = 17) devices. ELO was significantly more common in the unsupported unibody graft design (P <.024) and with extension of the graft limb to the external iliac artery (P <.001). ELO was managed with an endovascular approach (EVA), including some combination of mechanical thrombectomy (n = 8), angioplasty with or without stenting (n = 8), and thrombolysis (n = 2) in 12 patients and bypass procedures (femoral-femoral bypass, n = 11; axillofemoral bypass, n = 1; and aortofemoral bypass, n = 1) in 13. At 12-month follow-up, freedom from secondary procedures with EVA was 80.2 +/- 17.7% versus 53.2 +/-17.1% with extra-anatomic bypass (EB) (P = NS). Secondary patency was 100% with EVA and 80.6 +/- 14.4% with EB (P = NS). Of the 12 EVAs, there was 1 (8.3%) perioperative mortality with EVA and none with EB. EB failure was directly attributed to donor limb occlusion in 4 of 6 EVAs (67%), and when this occurred it resulted in bilateral lower extremity ischemia. Amputation was required in 2 of 12 (16.7%) EBs versus none of the 12 EVAs (P = NS). EVA never resulted in graft dislodgement or endoleak but did identify an underlying treatable cause in 8 of 12 (67%).\nBoth EVA and EB are acceptable management strategies for ELO. The potential risk of graft dislodgement was not observed with an EVA. If EB is employed, assessment of the donor limb and treatment of any underlying lesions is advisable in an attempt to minimize future donor limb occlusion.",

Amputation was required in 2 of 12 (16.7%) EBs versus none of the 12 EVAs (P = NS). EVA never resulted in graft dislodgement or endoleak but did identify an underlying treatable cause in 8 of 12 (67%).",

    "abstract": "Controversy exists as to the cause of ischemic colitis complicating endovascular aneurysm repair. Occlusion of the hypogastric arteries (HAs) during endovascular repair of aortoiliac aneurysms (AIAs) results in a significant incidence of buttock claudication, and has been suggested as a causative factor in the development of postprocedural colonic ischemia, in addition to factors such as systemic hypotension, embolization of atheromatous debris, and interruption of inferior mesenteric artery inflow. To analyze the relationship between perioperative HA occlusion and postoperative ischemic colitis, we reviewed our experience over 2 years with Food and Drug Administration-approved endovascular graft devices for treatment of AIAs.\nElective repair of AIAs with bifurcated endovascular grafts was performed in 233 patients over a 2-year period. These included 184 AneuRx grafts, 17 Ancure grafts, and 32 Excluder grafts. During the experience, 44 patients (18.9%) underwent unilateral perioperative HA occlusion (28 right, 16 left) during the course of endovascular AIA repair, and 1 patient (0.4%) underwent bilateral HA occlusion.\nIn 4 patients (1.7%) signs and symptoms of ischemic colitis developed 2.0 +/- 1.4 days postoperatively. In all patients the diagnosis was confirmed at sigmoidoscopy, and initial treatment included bowel rest, hydration, and intravenous antibiotic agents. Three patients with bilateral patent HAs required colonic resection 14.7 +/- 9.7 days after the initial diagnosis, and 2 of these 3 patients died in the postoperative period. Pathologic findings confirmed the presence of atheroemboli in the colonic vasculature in all 3 patients who underwent colonic resection. The fourth patient had undergone multiple manipulations of the left HA in an unsuccessful attempt to preserve patency of this vessel during AIA repair. This patient recovered completely with nonoperative management. Perioperative unilateral HA occlusion was not associated with a significantly higher incidence of postoperative ischemic colitis.\nPerioperative HA occlusion during aortoiliac open or endovascular surgery may contribute to development of the rare but potentially lethal complication of ischemic colitis. However, our extensive experience suggests that embolization of atheromatous debris to the HA tissue beds during endovascular manipulations, rather than proximal HA occlusion, is the primary cause of clinically significant ischemic colitis after endovascular aneurysm repair.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular stent graft repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) prevents rupture by excluding the aneurysm sac from systemic arterial pressure. Current surveillance protocols after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) follow secondary markers of sac pressurization, namely, endoleak and sac enlargement. We report the first clinical experience with the use of a permanently implantable, ultrasound-activated remote pressure transducer to measure intrasac pressure after EVAR.\nOver 7 months, 14 patients underwent EVAR of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with implantation of an ultrasound-activated remote pressure transducer fixed to the outside of the stent graft and exposed to the excluded aortic sac. Twelve patients received modular bifurcated stent grafts, and 2 patients received aortouniiliac devices. Intrasac pressures were measured directly with an intravascular catheter and by the remote sensor at stent-graft deployment. Follow-up sac pressures were measured with a remote sensor and correlated with systemic arterial pressure at every follow-up visit. Mean follow-up was 2.6 +/-1.9 months.\nExcellent concordance was found between catheter-derived and transducer-derived intrasac pressssure intraoperatively. Pulsatile waveforms were seen in all functioning transducers at each evaluation interval. One implant ceased to function at 2 months of follow-up. In 1 patient a type I endoleak was diagnosed on 1-month computed tomography (CT) scans; 3 type II endoleaks were observed. Those patients with complete exclusion of the aneurysm on CT scans had a significant difference in systemic and sac systolic pressures initially (P <.001) and at 1 month (P <.001). Initial sac diastolic pressures were higher than systemic diastolic pressures (P <.001). The ratio of systemic to sac systolic pressure increased over time in those patients with complete aneurysm exclusion ( P <.001). Four of 6 patients with no endoleak and greater than 1-month follow-up had diminution of sac systolic pressure to 40 mm Hg or less by 3 months.\nThis is the first report of a totally implantable chronic pressure transducer to monitor the results of EVAR in human beings. Aneurysm exclusion leads to gradual diminution of sac pressure over several months. Additional clinical follow-up will be necessary to determine whether aneurysm sac pressure monitoring can replace CT in the long-term surveillance of patients after EVAR.",

    "abstract": "The effect of a rat carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on homocysteine and the metabolic enzymes methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) was studied.\nRats were placed into 7 groups: (1) no anesthesia (NA), (2) anesthesia only (AO), (3) skin opened and closed (O/C), (4) skin opened with exposure of the carotid artery and closed (O/E/C), (5) carotid isolated and clamped (CO), (6) open CEA, and (7) open femoral endarterectomy (FEA). End points included homocysteine, hepatic MTHFR, and CBS activity.\nHomocysteine in the NA, AO, O/C, O/E/C, and FEA were low and not different. CEA produced a 6-fold increase in homocysteine when compared with non-CEA groups. Specifically, CEA produced an increase in homocysteine versus the AO group at 2 weeks (11.3 +/- 0.7 vs 2.1 +/- 0.9 micromol/L;P < .001), 4 weeks (8.9 +/- 0.7 vs 3.5 +/- 0.9 micromol/L; P = .004) and 6 weeks (7.7 +/- 0.9 vs 3.1 +/- 1.5 micromol/L; P = .03). The CO group had increased homocysteine versus the O/C, O/E/C, and FEA, but was lower than the CEA group. CEA produced an increase in MTHFR and CBS versus the AO group.\nCEA resulted in elevated levels of homocysteine; however, when broken down into its component parts, no elevation was observed except for a small increase with the CO procedure. Manipulation of the femoral artery did not raise homocysteine levels. The increase in homocysteine is possibly due to the combination of vessel wall damage and changes in cerebral blood flow dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is reported to stimulate ischemia-induced arteriogenesis (collateral artery development) by recruiting monocytes and macrophages into areas of active arteriogenesis. To determine whether the MCP-1-mediated response occurs through its receptor, CC-chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), we induced hindlimb ischemia in mice lacking the receptor for MCP-1 (CCR2 -/- ) and measured limb blood flow recovery, collateral artery development, and monocyte and macrophage recruitment.\nHindlimb ischemia was induced by excising the left femoral artery in CCR2 -/- and wild-type mice. Hindlimb blood flow recovery, as measured using laser Doppler perfusion imaging, was equivalent in both groups ( P = .78 for foot and P = 0.38 for calf). Collateral artery development, as measured by angiography at postoperative day 14 and 31, likewise did not differ between the 2 groups ( P = .46 and P = .67). Counts of monocytes and macrophages in calf and thigh muscle sections of mice sacrificed on postoperative day 7 revealed that although CCR2 -/- mice recruited 44% fewer monocytes and macrophages to areas of ischemia in the calf, they recruited similar numbers of monocytes and macrophages to areas of active arteriogenesis in the thigh. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and MCP-1 mRNA levels were higher in the thigh muscle of CCR2 -/- mice than in wild-type mice (5.5-fold and 42.3-fold induction operated to unoperated vs 2.6-fold and 6.1-fold induction operated to unoperated, respectively).\nBlood flow recovery, arteriogenesis, and monocyte and macrophage recruitment to the thigh was normal in CCR2 -/- mice. However, monocyte and macrophage recruitment to the ischemic calf was diminished in CCR2 -/- mice. Our results show that MCP-1 signaling through CCR2 is not required for physiologic arteriogenesis in response to severe hindlimb ischemia. ICAM-1 upregulation may substitute for MCP-1 signaling through CCR2 in order to allow normal arteriogenesis in CCR2 -/- mice.",

Of these operations, 2508 (44%) were performed on diabetics. Tissue loss was the indication for surgery in 77% of diabetics and in 52% of nondiabetics. The proportion of femorodistal bypasses was 43% in diabetics and 24% in nondiabetics, whereas the proportion of reconstructions for aortofemoral arterial occlusive disease was 16% in diabetics and 34% in nondiabetics.\nThirty-day mortality was 4.5% in diabetics and 3.4% in nondiabetics ( P = .05). The rate for early below-knee amputation was 6.5% in diabetics and 3.3% in nondiabetics ( P < .001). Independent factors for postoperative death were aortofemoral reconstruction (odds ratio [OR], 4.0), preoperative cardiac risk factor (OR, 3.1), primary surgery (OR, 2.0), renal insufficiency (OR, 1.9), urgent surgery (OR, 1.7), and age (OR, 1.3). Diabetes was an independent risk factor for postoperative below-knee amputation (OR, 1.7), cardiac complications (OR, 1.5), and superficial wound infection (OR, 1.3). There was an inverse association between diabetes and acute graft occlusion (OR, 0.8). Independent risk factors for early postoperative mortality in diabetes were aortofemoral reconstruction (OR, 2.5), urgent surgery (OR, 2.0), male gender (OR, 2.0), renal insufficiency (OR, 1.9), cardiac risk factor (OR, 1.7), and age (OR, 1.4). In nondiabetics independent risk factors for early postoperative mortality were aortofemoral reconstruction (OR, 4.5), cardiac risk factor (OR, 3.6), primary surgery (OR, 2.6), and extra-anatomic bypass (OR, 2.3).\nDiabetes was not an independent risk factor for early postoperative mortality in CLI as there was an increased morbidity in diabetics associated with old age, male gender, known coronary artery disease, and renal insufficiency, as well as urgent surgery. As diabetics have increased proclivity for these factors, special attention needs to be paid to their preoperative assessments.",

    "abstract": "We sought to identify specific determinants of long-term cardiac events and survival in patients undergoing major arterial operations after preoperative cardiac risk stratification by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. A secondary goal was to define the potential long-term protective effect of previous coronary revascularization (coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG] or percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) in patients with vascular disease.\nFour hundred fifty-nine patients underwent risk stratification (high, intermediate, low) before 534 consecutive elective or urgent (<24 hours after presentation) open cerebrovascular, aortic, or lower limb reconstruction procedures between August 1996 and January 2000. Long-term follow-up (mean, 56 +/- 14 months) was possible in 97% of patients. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival data. Long-term prognostic variables were identified with the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model and contingency table analysis censoring early (<30 days) perioperative deaths.\nWhile 5-year survival was 72% for the overall cohort, cardiac causes accounted for only 24% of all deaths, and new cardiac events (myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, unstable angina, new coronary angiography, new CABG or PCI, cardiac death) affected only 4.6% of patients per year during follow-up. High cardiac risk stratification level (hazards ratio [HR], 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-3.4), adverse perioperative cardiac events (myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmia; HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.1), and age (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.2-0.6) were independently prognostic for latemortality. Preoperative cardiac risk levels also correlated with new cardiac event rates ( P < .01) and late cardiac mortality ( P = .02). Modestly improved survival in patients who had undergone CABG or PCI less than 5 years before vascular operations compared with those who had undergone revascularization 5 or more years previously and those at high risk without previous coronary intervention (73% vs 58% vs 62% 5-year survival; P = .02) could be demonstrated with univariate testing, but not with multivariate analysis. Type of operation, urgency, noncardiac complications, and presence of diabetes did not affect long-term survival.\nDespite cardiac events being a less common cause of late mortality after vascular surgery, perioperative cardiac factors (age, preoperative risk level, early cardiac complications) are the primary determinants of patient longevity. Patients undergoing more recent (<5 years) CABG or PCI before vascular surgery do not have an obvious survival advantage compared with patients at high cardiac risk without previous coronary interventions.",

    "abstract": "Successful carotid artery stenting (CAS) involves gaining access to the common carotid artery, characterizing and crossing the lesion, deploying an anti-embolic device and stent, and retrieving the anti-embolic device. These steps are critical determinants of the complexity of the procedure. The frequency with which technical challenges are encountered during CAS is ill-defined. The purpose of this investigation was to review the incidence and types of technical challenges encountered during CAS and determine their effect on outcome.\nData were prospectively collected for 194 consecutive CAS procedures (177 patients) and separated into group 1, standard CAS technique, and group 2, procedures with technical challenges requiring modifications to the technique. Technical challenges were defined as difficult femoral arterial access (aortoiliac occlusive disease), complex aortic arch anatomy (elongated or bovine arch, deep takeoff of the innominate artery, tandem stenoses (CCA, innominate artery), difficult internal carotid artery anatomy (tortuosity, high-grade stenosis), and circumferential internal carotid artery calcification. The incidence of technical challenges, types of technical modifications required, and effect on outcomes were determined.\nFifty technically challenging situations (26%) were encountered in 194 CAS procedures (group 2), which required advanced technical skills. Standard methods were used in the other 144 procedures (group 1, 74%). No significant differences in 30-day stroke and death rates were noted between the groups (group 1, 3.1%; group 2, 2.0%; P = .564).\nTwenty-six percent of the procedures required a modification in the standard technique for successful CAS. Circumferential calcification and severe tortuosity continue to be relative contraindications to CAS. Recognition of these technical challenges and increasing facility with the methods to manage them will enable expanded use of CAS without increased morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Acute clinical events resulting from atherosclerosis (myocardial infarction, stroke) are associated with impaired endogenous fibrinolysis, the system by which the body lyses inappropriately formed thrombus. Endurance exercise training improves fibrinolysis in normal subjects and those with coronary artery disease. The hypothesis of this study was that exercise training would improve fibrinolysis in subjects with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nTwenty-one men with intermittent claudication (IC-EX) underwent treadmill exercise training for 6 months. Twenty age-matched male subjects with IC were followed for the same period (IC-NONEX). Fibrinolytic activity was measured prior to entry into exercise or \"usual care,\" and at the completion of the study period. Fibrinolysis was quantified by measurement of the activity levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, the activator of fibrinolysis) and its inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), using an amidolytic method. Fibrinolysis, quantified as increased PAI-1 activity, was reduced in both claudicant groups relative to healthy controls at baseline. After 6 months of exercise, subjects in the IC-EX group experienced significant improvements in fibrinolytic activity, manifested as a 23% decrease in PAI-1 activity and a 28% increase in tPA activity. No changes occurred in the IC-NONEX group. In the IC-EX group, subjects with the highest initial PAI-1 values experienced the greatest decreases in PAI-1 activity and thus the greatest benefit from exercise.\nPatients with PAD have impaired fibrinolytic activity, manifested primarily as increases in the inhibitor of fibrinolysis, PAI-1. Six months of exercise training reduced these impairments, and may serve as an intervention to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Use of inflow sources distal to the common femoral artery (CFA) for bypass to infrapopliteal arteries is a compromise measure when the length of the vein is not adequate. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcome of vein infrapopliteal bypass arising from the CFA and from the distal superficial femoral or popliteal and tibial arteries in patients with limb-threatening ischemia.\nOver 13 years, 160 vein infrapopliteal vein bypass procedures (160 patients) were randomized into 2 groups, 80 with inflow arising from the CFA (group 1) and 80 with inflow from below the CFA (group 2). Patency and limb salvage rates were assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method. All patients underwent graft surveillance at discharge and at 30 days and 6 months after surgery, then every 6 months thereafter. Follow-up ranged from 30 days to 127 months (mean, 49 months).\nGroups were similar with regard to age, sex, and most atherosclerotic risk factors. Gangrene as an indication for surgery was statistically more frequent in group 1 (73.7% vs 48.7%; P = .002), whereas nonhealing ulcer and rest pain were statistically more frequent in group 2 (respectively, 51.2% vs 25%; P = .001 and 46.2% vs 28.7%; P = .03). No patients died during the perioperative (30 days) period. At 1, 3, and 5 years patency and limb salvage rates were comparable between groups, tending toward significance for the 5-year primary patency rate (73% vs 57%; P = .08).\nIn the absence of significant proximal disease, infrapopliteal revascularization arising distal to the CFA can ensure patency and limb salvage rates statistically similar to those with use of the CFA. Moreover, procedures arising distal to the CFA required fewer graft revisions to maintain patency of failing grafts.",

    "abstract": "Infrainguinal bypass grafting with arm vein is associated with lower patency rates compared with saphenous vein conduits. In this study the effect of a duplex ultrasound surveillance program to enable identification and treat graft lesions with open or endovascular repair on patency was analyzed.\nOver 9 years 89 infrainguinal arm vein (26% spliced vein) bypasses were performed to treat critical lower limb ischemia in 89 patients without adequate saphenous vein conduits. Seventy-six (85%) of the bypasses were repeat procedures. Grafts were assessed at operation with duplex ultrasound scanning, then enrolled in a surveillance program. Graft stenoses with peak systolic velocity greater than 300 cm/s and velocity ratio greater than 3.5, detected at duplex ultrasound scanning, were repaired with percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) if specific criteria were met, including greater than 3 months since primary procedure, lesion length less than 2 cm, and graft diameter greater than 3.5 mm, or with open surgical repair for early appearing or extensive graft lesions.\nDuring a mean 26-month follow-up, duplex surveillance resulted in a 48% (43 bypasses) intervention rate. Primary patency rate was 43% at 3 years. Twenty-six (43%) of 61 lesions identified and repaired met criteria for PTA; the remaining 35 graft lesions (stenosis, n = 30; vein graft aneurysm, n = 5) were surgically corrected with vein patch angioplasty (n = 15), interposition grafting (n = 13), jump graft bypass (n = 6), or open repair (n = 1). At 3 years the assisted primary patency rate was 91% (7 graft failures). Multiple interventions were performed in 18 (42%) revised grafts because of metachronous (n = 6) or repair site stenosis (n = 12). In 18 graft interventions (PTA, n = 9; surgery, n = 9) recurrent stenosis developed, and endovascular therapy was used in one third (n = 6). At 3 years the stenosis-free patency rate for PTA (48%) and surgically repaired (53%) graft lesions was similar.\nArm veins used in lower limb bypass procedures are prone to development of stenosis and aneurysm, lesions easily detected with a life-long duplex ultrasound surveillance program. Excellent long-term patency (91%) was achieved despite graft intervention being performed in nearly half of all bypasses and one third of revised grafts. Endovascular treatment was possible in half of all graft stenosis, with outcomes similar to those with surgical repair.",

Patients were classified into 3 groups: combined aortic and renal revascularization, isolated renal revascularization, and catheter-based procedures (angioplasty with or without stenting). Population-based trends were determined by using sampling weights for each year to estimate the total number of each intervention in the United States. Outcomes were compared using multivariate logistic regression analysis for risk-adjustment.\nA 73% decrease in combined aortic and renal revascularizations ( P = .033) and a 56% decrease in isolated renal revascularizations ( P < .001) occurred during the study period. Catheter-based procedures have increased 173% from 0.4 to 1.1 procedures per 100,000 adults during this same time period ( P < .001). Predictors favoring catheter-based treatment were admission acuity, increasing age, nonwhite race, and high socioeconomic status. Predictors of mortality for all 3 treatment groups included increasing age, emergent admission, and nonwhite race.\nA significant change in the management of patients with renovascular hypertension has occurred, with a shift towards less invasive catheter-based interventions. A better understanding of the diffusion of this technology in the treatment of individuals with renovascular hypertension will influence the training and distribution of future vascular specialists responsible for these patients.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a tip-pressure sensor system for intra-aneurysm pressure measurement in an in vitro aneurysm model and in vivo in patients by studying intraobserver variability.\nWe used 0.014-inch guide wire-mounted tip-pressure sensors. For the in vitro aneurysm model, saccular aneurysms filled with thrombus were inserted in a left-heart-driven aneurysm model. Pressure was measured simultaneously with guide wire pressure sensors in the lumen of the model and within the aneurysm thrombus. In vivo, intraobserver variability was evaluated with double percutaneous translumbar puncture of the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with pressure measurement in 15 patients (14 men, 1 woman; median age, 75 years [63-80 years]; median AAA diameter, 55 mm [47-80 mm]) at a median of 32 months (2-100 months) after endovascular aneurysm repair. Mean pressure index was calculated as the percentage of mean intraaneurysm pressure relative to simultaneous mean systemic pressure.\nIn vitro, the difference in pressure between the tip-sensor measurements and the pressure output of the aneurysm model was 2 mm Hg (1-4 mm Hg) when the output varied between 150/50 and 200/100 mm Hg (n = 90). Mean pressure in the lumen of the model and within the aneurysm thrombus differed by 1 mm Hg (-5-15 mm Hg (n = 10).

    "abstract": "Limb and pelvic ischemia are known complications after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). The objective of this paper is to present our experience with the incidence, presentation, and management of such complications.\nOver 9 years 311 patients with aortic aneurysms underwent EVAR. A retrospective review identified 28 patients (9.0%) with ischemic complications.\nAmong 28 patients with ischemic complications, 21 had lower extremity ischemia and 7 had pelvic ischemia: colon (n = 4), buttock (n = 2), and spinal cord (n = 2). Of the 21 patients with lower extremity ischemia, 15 had limb occlusions (71.4%), 3 due to embolization (14.7%) and 3 the result of common femoral artery thromboses (14.7%). Limb occlusions were manifested as severe acute arterial ischemia (n = 6), rest pain (n = 3), intermittent claudication (n = 5), and decreased femoral pulse (n = 1). Limb occlusions were managed with thrombectomy and stent placement (n = 4), femorofemoral bypass (n = 7), eventual explantation because of persistent endoleak (n = 1), and expectant management (n = 3). The 3 patients with occlusions managed expectantly all had intermittent claudication, which has subsequently improved. In the 6 patients with lower extremity ischemia due to embolization or common femoral artery injury presentation was acute, and embolectomy was performed, followed by femoral artery endarterectomy and patch angioplasty or placement of an interposition graft. One patient who had a prolonged postoperative course including cardiac arrest subsequently required distal bypass and ultimately above- knee amputation. Among the 7 patients with pelvic ischemia, 2 patients had unilateral hypogastric artery embolization before the original surgery. Among the patients with colonic ischemia, 3 were seen immediately postoperatively, and required colectomy and colostomy. Two patients who required urgent colectomy subsequently had multiple organ failure, and died in the perioperative period. One patient had abdominal pain 1 week after surgery, which was managed with bowel rest, with subsequent improvement. In 2 patients spinal cord ischemia developed immediately after surgery, which resulted in persistent paraplegia. Buttock ischemia developed in 2 patients, 1 of whom required fasciotomy because of gluteal compartment syndrome, and had transient renal failure.\nIschemic complications are not uncommon after EVAR, and may exceed the incidence with open surgical repair. Limb ischemia is most often a result of limb occlusion, and can be successfully managed with standard interventions. Pelvic ischemia often results from atheroembolization despite preservation of hypogastric arterial circulation. Colonic and spinal ischemia are associated with the highest morbidity and mortality.",

Of the 21 patients with lower extremity ischemia, 15 had limb occlusions (71.4%), 3 due to embolization (14.7%) and 3 the result of common femoral artery thromboses (14.7%). Limb occlusions were manifested as severe acute arterial ischemia (n = 6), rest pain (n = 3), intermittent claudication (n = 5), and decreased femoral pulse (n = 1). Limb occlusions were managed with thrombectomy and stent placement (n = 4), femorofemoral bypass (n = 7), eventual explantation because of persistent endoleak (n = 1), and expectant management (n = 3). The 3 patients with occlusions managed expectantly all had intermittent claudication, which has subsequently improved. In the 6 patients with lower extremity ischemia due to embolization or common femoral artery injury presentation was acute, and embolectomy was performed, followed by femoral artery endarterectomy and patch angioplasty or placement of an interposition graft. One patient who had a prolonged postoperative course including cardiac arrest subsequently required distal bypass and ultimately above- knee amputation. Among the 7 patients with pelvic ischemia, 2 patients had unilateral hypogastric artery embolization before the original surgery. Among the patients with colonic ischemia, 3 were seen immediately postoperatively, and required colectomy and colostomy. Two patients who required urgent colectomy subsequently had multiple organ failure, and died in the perioperative period. One patient had abdominal pain 1 week after surgery, which was managed with bowel rest, with subsequent improvement.

    "abstract": "Hypogastric artery interruption is sometimes required during aortoiliac aneurysm repair. We have not experienced some of the life-threatening complications of pelvic ischemia reported by others. Therefore we analyzed our experience to identify factors that help minimize pelvic ischemia with unilateral and bilateral hypogastric artery interruption.\nFrom 1995 to 2003, 48 patients with aortoiliac aneurysm required interruption of both hypogastric arteries as part of endovascular (n = 32) or open surgical (n = 16) repair. During endovascular aneurysm repair coils were placed at the origin of the hypogastric arteries, and bilateral hypogastric artery interruptions were staged at 1 to 2 weeks when possible. Open surgery necessitated oversewing or excluding the origins of the hypogastric arteries and extending the prosthetic graft to the external iliac or femoral artery. Collateral branches from the external iliac and femoral arteries were preserved, and patients received systemic heparinization (50 units/kg).\nThere was no buttock necrosis, ischemic colitis requiring colon resection, or death with the bilateral hypogastric artery interruption. Initially buttock claudication developed in 20 patients (42%), but persisted in only 7 patients (15%) at 1 year. New onset of impotence occurred in 4 of 28 patients (14%), and there were no neurologic deficits.\nBilateral hypogastric artery interruptions can be accomplished with limited morbidity. When hypogastric artery interruption is needed during endovascular aneurysm repair, certain principles help minimize pelvic ischemia. These include hypogastric artery interruption at its origin to preserve the pelvic collateral vessels, staging bilateral hypogastric artery interruptions when possible, preserving collateral branches from the femoral and external iliac arteries, and providing adequate heparinization of the patient during these procedures.",

We investigated the clinical significance of naloxone by measuring EAAs in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic surgery.\nTwenty-seven patients (15 men and 12 women; mean age, 66 +/- 12 years) undergoing prosthetic replacement of the thoracoabdominal aorta (n = 19) or the descending thoracic aorta (n = 8) from April 1997 to June 2003 under distal perfusion and mild hypothermia were enrolled in this cohort study with historical controls. Their etiology was 7 dissections and 20 nondissections. In 16 patients (naloxone group), intravenous infusion of naloxone (1 microg/kg/h) was continued until the patients became alert. In the remaining 11 patients (control group) naloxone was not given. CSF drainage was used in all patients. CSF levels of EAAs, glutamate, aspartate, and glycine were measured at 6 points in time until 72 hours postoperatively, using a high-performance liquid chromatography method.\nIn 5 patients with SCI (2 patients in control group, 3 in naloxone group), CSF levels of glutamate and glycine continued to increase even at 72 hours postoperatively, and were significantly more elevated than those in patients without SCI ( P < .0001, glutamate; P = .0006, glycine). Postoperative maximum levels of CSF glutamate and glycine were also significantly higher in patients with postoperative SCI than in patients without SCI (glutamate: 215.3% +/- 158.6% vs 32.9% +/- 37.3% increase from baseline, P < .0001; glycine: 309.1% +/- 218.2% vs 89.2% +/- 103.1% increase from baseline, P = .0036). CSF levels of glutamate and aspartate in naloxone group were significantly lower than those in control group ( P = .0161, glutamate; P < .0001, aspartate).

In multivariate logistic regression analysis, postoperative maximum CSF glutamate >100% from baseline ( P < .001) and postoperative maximum level of CSF glycine ( P = .005)were identified as the independent risk factors for SCI. Both SCI ( P < .001) and postoperative maximum level of CSF glycine ( P = .005) were the independent predictors for postoperative maximum level of CSF glutamate >100% from baseline.\nCSF levels of EAAs are elevated in patients with SCI.

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the initial and 1-year outcome of endovascular treatment of thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections collated in the European Collaborators on Stent Graft Techniques for Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection Repair (EUROSTAR) and the United Kingdom Thoracic Endograft registries.\nFour hundred forty-three patients underwent endovascular repair of thoracic aortic disease between September 1997 and August 2003 (EUROSTAR, 340 patients; UK, 103 patients). Patients represented 4 major disease groups: degenerative aneurysm (n = 249), aortic dissection (n = 131), false anastomotic aneurysm (n = 13), and traumatic aortic injury (n = 50).\nMean age in the entire study group was 63 years. Fifty-two percent of patients were deemed at high risk for open surgery because of major comorbidity. Sixty percent of patients underwent an elective procedure, and 35% required emergency treatment. Conventional indications for treatment of aortic dissection, including aortic expansion, continuous pain, rupture, or symptoms of branch occlusion constituted the basis for endograft placement in 57% of patients, whereas in 43% of patients aortic dissections were asymptomatic. Primary technical success was obtained in 87% of patients with degenerative aneurysm and in 89% with aortic dissection. Paraplegia was a postoperative complication in 4.0% of patients with degenerative aneurysm and 0.8% of patients with aortic dissection (not significant). Thirty-day mortality in the entire study group was 9.3%, with mortality rates after elective procedures of 5.3% for degenerative aneurysms and 6.5% for aortic dissection. Mortality for degenerative aneurysm after emergency repair was higher (28%; P <.0001) then after elective procedures. For aortic dissection the emergency repair rate was 12% (not significant compared with elective repair of aortic dissection, and P = .025 compared with emergency repair of degenerative aneurysm). One-year follow-up was complete in 195 patients. The outcome at 1 year was more favorable for aortic dissection than for degenerative aneurysm with regard to aortic expansion (0% vs 15%; P = .001) and late survival (90% vs 80%; P = .048). In the groups with false anastomotic aneurysm and traumatic aortic injury, 30-day mortality rates were 8% and 6%, respectively.\nThis multicenter experience demonstrates acceptable rates for operative mortality and paraplegia after endovascular repair of thoracic aortic disease. Outcome after 30 days and 1 year was more favorable for aortic dissection than for degenerative aneurysm. However, the durability of this technique is currently unknown, and continued use of registries should provide data from long-term follow-up.",

    "results": "Mean age in the entire study group was 63 years. Fifty-two percent of patients were deemed at high risk for open surgery because of major comorbidity. Sixty percent of patients underwent an elective procedure, and 35% required emergency treatment. Conventional indications for treatment of aortic dissection, including aortic expansion, continuous pain, rupture, or symptoms of branch occlusion constituted the basis for endograft placement in 57% of patients, whereas in 43% of patients aortic dissections were asymptomatic. Primary technical success was obtained in 87% of patients with degenerative aneurysm and in 89% with aortic dissection. Paraplegia was a postoperative complication in 4.0% of patients with degenerative aneurysm and 0.8% of patients with aortic dissection (not significant). Thirty-day mortality in the entire study group was 9.3%, with mortality rates after elective procedures of 5.3% for degenerative aneurysms and 6.5% for aortic dissection. Mortality for degenerative aneurysm after emergency repair was higher (28%; P <.0001) then after elective procedures. For aortic dissection the emergency repair rate was 12% (not significant compared with elective repair of aortic dissection, and P = .025 compared with emergency repair of degenerative aneurysm). One-year follow-up was complete in 195 patients. The outcome at 1 year was more favorable for aortic dissection than for degenerative aneurysm with regard to aortic expansion (0% vs 15%; P = .001) and late survival (90% vs 80%; P = .048). In the groups with false anastomotic aneurysm and traumatic aortic injury, 30-day mortality rates were 8% and 6%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the use of operative training resources for vascular surgery residents (VSRs) and general surgery residents (GSRs) over the past 10 years in the United States, to address questions concerning adequate endovascular versus open surgical training and the potential to expand the number of VSRs to meet future workforce needs.\nNational operative data from the Residency Review Committee for Surgery (RRC) were analyzed for all vascular surgery (VS) and general surgery (GS) training programs from 1994 to 2003. GSR experience in programs with and without associated VS programs was also compared.\nMean total VS volume per VSR increased from 220 operations in 1994 to 368 in 2003, owing to the addition of 140 endovascular procedures by 2003. GSR volume was more stable, with 117 mean total VS operations in 1994 and 122 in 2003. This volume was distributed as approximately 50% major open VS operations for both VSR and GSR. In addition, 39% of VSR experience was endovascular, whereas 32% of GSR experience was vascular access. The average VSR performed 2.7 times more major open VS operations than each GSR, but because of the 10-fold greater number of GSRs, VSRs performed only 20% of the total major operations available for VS training. Selective procedures, such as renal revascularization and open infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair decreased over time, while endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair increased dramatically, accounting for 46% of aortic aneurysm repairs per VSR in 2003. The mean volume of total interventional procedures per VSR in 2003 was 152 diagnostic and 213 therapeutic. GSRs in programs with and without an associated VS program had very similar operative volumes.\nInterventional procedures have increased VSR operative volume by 50% in recent years, with only a 12% decrease in major open operations. Nearly all VSRs currently meet RRC minimum requirements for open and endovascular procedures. Mean GSR operative volume has been stable, and far exceeds RRC minimum requirements. Based on the number of major open vascular operations available for training in 2003, the current number of VSR positions could be increased by 50% if GSR operative volume was decreased by 15%. However, increased interventional volume would also be required, for which there is competition with other specialties.",

Random samples of 2000 subjects per location were interviewed by telephone, and a sub-sample of subjects completed medical interviews and underwent physical examination, and the presence of varicose veins, trophic changes, and venous symptoms was recorded.\nPrevalence of varicose veins, skin trophic changes, and venous symptoms was not statistically different in the 4 locations. In contrast, sex-related differences were found: varicose veins were found in 50.5% of women versus 30.1% of men ( P < .001); trophic skin changes were found in 2.8% of women versus 5.4% of men ( P = NS), and venous symptoms were found in 51.3% of women 51.3% versus 20.4% of men ( P < .001). Main risk factors for varicose veins were age and family history in both sexes, and pregnancy in women. Female sex was a significant factor only for non-saphenous varicose veins. Varicose veins, age, and pitting edema were the most significant risk factors for trophic skin changes. The risk factors for venous symptoms were female sex, varicose veins, and prolonged sitting or standing. A negative relationship with age was found in women.\nOur results show a high prevalence of chronic venous disorders of the lower limbs in the general population of France, with no significant geographic variations.

    "abstract": "In the presence of superficial and deep vein insufficiency the effects, if any, of concurrent incompetent perforator veins (IPVs) on clinical status are masked. On the basis of multivariate regression analysis, this study examines the significance of perforator vein incompetence across the clinical classes of CEAP (C-class CEAP ) in relation to the superficial and deep systems, and assesses the role of factors implicated in the presence and number of IPVs in chronic venous disease (CVD).\nThe study included 525 limbs in 360 patients, ages 17 to 96 years, referred for investigation of CVD. The protocol entailed history taking, physical examination, and duplex scanning (reflux > 0.5 s), with emphasis on IPVs. Exclusion criteria included peripheral vascular disease, unrelated edema, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and recent (< 1 year) deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\nLimbs were stratified as C 0 , 84; C 1 , 25; C 2 , 231; C 3 , 66; C 4 , 48; C 5 , 23; and C 6 , 48. C-class CEAP was separately regressed with age ( P < .001), sex ( P < .25), contralateral CVD ( P < .2), CVD recurrence ( P = .022), previous DVT ( P < .001), superficial vein reflux ( P < .001); deep vein reflux ( P < .001), perforator vein reflux ( P < .001), and number of IPVs ( P < .001).

    "abstract": "In at least half of patients with iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis post-thrombotic syndrome develops when only anticoagulant therapy is given. We combined thrombolysis, applied under ischemic conditions,with surgical thrombectomy to restore patency and valve function. The technique and the short-term and long-term results in 2 patient series are reported.\nA catheter was inserted into a foot vein of the thrombosed leg, and the limb was excluded from the circulation with a pneumatic cuff placed on the thigh with the patient under general anesthesia. Urokinase (0.5 million-3 million IU) and heparin were infused and allowed to act for 30 minutes while the pelvic axis was cleared with a Fogarty catheter through an inguinal venotomy. The external iliac vein was then clamped and the cuff removed. Thrombi that detached from the wall were flushed out with reactive hyperemia and squeezed out with manual leg compression. The blood was retrieved, washed, and transfused back into the patient. Various additional procedures were performed to secure outflow. Two patient series are reported: 1 with 12 consecutive patients and 1 with 21 patients who were successfully treated 6 to 10 years previously. Follow-up data were obtained for all patients after 1 year and for 18 of 21 patients after 6 to 10 years. Patency and valve function were assessed with duplex scanning or venography. Studies of blood coagulation and the kinetics of urokinase were performed in 5 additional patients.\nVein patency and valve function were restored in all consecutive patients. At 1 year none of the 33 patients had had recurrence, and none showed clinical signs of post-thrombotic syndrome. At 6 to 10 years 3 of 18 patients had experienced another venous thromboembolism, but none in the treated leg. Sixteen legs were asymptomatic without compression therapy, and 2 had venous claudication. Coagulation studies showed a trace concentration of urokinase and a mild decrease in fibrinogen in the systemic circulation. The concentration of urokinase in blood collected from the treated leg was only 1% of that infused.\nRegional thrombolysis combined with surgical thrombectomy is relatively easy to perform and seems safe. Vein patency and valve function were restored, and post-thrombotic syndrome was prevented. Additional procedures to overcome pelvic vein obstructions were required in 11 of 33 patients (33%). The procedure should be tested against standard anticoagulation therapy in patients with acute iliofemoral thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Poor iliac vein recanalization has been associated with compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery (RCIA/LCIV compression); however, this finding has been difficult to confirm. In a baseline study, RCIA/LCIV compression was detected with magnetic resonance imaging in patients with deep venous thrombosis. We compared recanalization of left femoropopliteal and iliac thrombosis with and without RCIA/LCIV compression.\nThis was a prospective blinded study carried out in a 1355-bed university hospital. Thirty-one patients were recruited from consecutive cohorts of patients with iliofemoral and femoropopliteal DVT who underwent direct thrombus magnetic resonance imaging, venous enhanced peak arterial magnetic resonance venography, and magnetic resonance arteriography as part of the baseline study relating RCIA/LCIV compression to extent of thrombosis. Magnetic resonance venography was performed 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis. Femoropopliteal and iliac venous segments that were occluded at diagnosis were classified as occluded, partially occluded, or patent on follow-up scans.\nAt 6-week follow-up, recanalization of all segments was incomplete. At both 6-month and 1-year follow-up, recanalization of left iliac segments associated with RCIA/LCIV compression was poorer compared with recanalization of left iliac segments not associated with compression (6 of 6 occluded vs 1 of 6 occluded and 1 of 6 partially occluded at 6 months, P =.015; 6 of 6 occluded vs 5 of 5 patent at 1 year, P = .002). This was due to complete failure of recanalization of left common iliac veins associated with RCIA/LCIV compression in 6 of 6 cases. All other iliac and femoropopliteal segments including left external iliac veins associated with RCIA/LCIV compression had high rates of recanalization at both 6 months and 1 year.\nRCIA/LCIV compression is associated with persistent occlusion of the left common iliac vein. The recanalization rate for all other femoropopliteal and iliac segments was high.",

    "abstract": "The majority of proximal deep venous thromboses (DVTs) are thought to have propagated as a contiguous column from the calf veins. However, several authors have proposed that ileofemoral DVT commonly originates in the left common iliac vein (LCIV) at a site of compression by the overlying right common iliac artery (RCIA/LCIV compression). This mechanism could explain both the left-sided predominance of ileofemoral DVT and the finding that ileofemoral DVT frequently occurs either in the absence of calf vein thrombosis (isolated ileofemoral DVT) or is not contiguous with calf vein thrombosis (noncontiguous ileofemoral DVT). This mechanism remains unconfirmed.\nThe purpose of this study was to detect RCIA/LCIV compression using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging in thrombosed and patent iliac veins, to determine whether RCIA/LCIV compression occurs more frequently in cases of left ileofemoral DVT than other types of DVT, and to determine if RCIA/LCIV compression is specifically associated with left isolated and noncontiguous ileofemoral DVT.\nThis prospective study conducted at the 1355-bed University Hospital included 18 patients with ileofemoral DVT, 23 with femoropopliteal DVT, 15 with isolated calf DVT recruited consecutively, and 28 control patients in whom DVT had been excluded. Interventions included magnetic resonance direct thrombus imaging (MRDTI), venous enhanced peak arterial magnetic resonance venography (VESPA) and magnetic resonance arteriography (MRA) within 48 hours of routine conventional venography (CV). RCIA/LCIV compression of patent LCIVs was assessed using VESPA and MRA; RCIA/LCIV compression of thrombosed LCIVs was assessed using MRDTI and MRA. The extent of calf and popliteal thrombosis was detected using CV; the extent of femoral and iliac thrombosis was detected using VESPA and MRDTI.\nRCIA/LCIV compression was more commonly detected in cases of left ileofemoral DVT (9/16 cases) than in cases of left femoropopliteal DVT (1/11 cases; P = .018), right femoropopliteal DVT (2/12 cases; P = .054), left isolated calf DVT (1/9 cases; P = .037), right isolated calf DVT (0/6 cases; P = .046) and control patients (4/28 cases; P = .006). RCIA/LCIV compression was more commonly detected in cases of left isolated ileofemoral DVT (6/6 cases; P = .005), and cases of left noncontiguous ileofemoral DVT (2/2 cases; P = .067) than in cases in which thrombosis was contiguous from the calf to the iliac veins (1/8 cases).\nRCIA/LCIV compression was strongly associated with left ileofemoral DVT and was specifically associated with cases that involve independent ileofemoral thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Residual subclavian vein stenosis after thoracic outlet decompression in patients with venous thoracic outlet syndrome is often treated with postoperative percutaneous angioplasty (PTA). However, interval recurrent thrombosis before postoperative angioplasty is performed can be a vexing problem. Therefore we initiated a prospective trial at 2 referral institutions to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined thoracic outlet decompression with intraoperative PTA performed in 1 stage.\nOver 3 years 25 consecutive patients (16 women, 9 men; median age, 30 years) underwent treatment for venous thoracic outlet syndrome with a standard protocol at 2 institutions. Twenty-one patients (84%) underwent preoperative thrombolysis to treat axillosubclavian vein thrombosis. First-rib resection was performed through combined supraclavicular and infraclavicular incisions. Intraoperative venography and subclavian vein PTA were performed through a percutaneous basilic vein approach. Postoperative anticoagulation therapy was not used routinely. Venous duplex ultrasound scanning was performed postoperatively and at 1, 6, and 12 months.\nIntraoperative venography enabled identification of residual subclavian vein stenosis in 16 patients (64%), and all underwent intraoperative PTA with 100% technical success. Postoperative duplex scans documented subclavian vein patency in 23 patients (92%). Complications included subclavian vein recurrent thrombosis in 2 patients (8%), and both underwent percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy, with restoration of patency in 1 patient. One-year primary and secondary patency rates were 92% and 96%, respectively, at life-table analysis.\nResidual subclavian vein stenosis after operative thoracic outlet decompression is common in patients with venous thoracic outlet syndrome. Combination treatment with surgical thoracic outlet decompression and intraoperative PTA is a safe and effective means for identifying and treating residual subclavian vein stenosis. Moreover, intraoperative PTA may reduce the incidence of postoperative recurrent thrombosis and eliminate the need for venous stent placement or open venous repair.",

Urgent laparotomy revealed the presence of a noninfective intrasac hemorrhage, due to recanalization of the lumbar arteries. These were successfully suture ligated. Delayed lumbar hemorrhage should be an important differential diagnosis by frontline medical personnel in patients with recent open aneurysm repair.

    "abstract": "Spontaneous dissection and rupture of the iliac artery is an unusual finding in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). We report the case of a patient with FMD who required emergent surgery because of rupture of an iliac artery dissection, and review 9 previously reported cases of iliac artery dissection associated with FMD. A 30-year-old man had abdominal pain, and went into shock. Angiograms revealed dissection of the left common iliac artery with extravasation. At emergent surgery the rupture site was in the proximal left common iliac artery and extended to the left external iliac artery. Interposition of the diseased artery with a Dacron graft was attempted, but cardiac arrest occurred, and resuscitation was unsuccessful. Pathologic examination showed typical characteristics of diffuse medial FMD. Ten cases (5 male and 5 female patients), including the present case, with dissection of iliac arteries associated with FMD have been reported. Median patient age was 45 years (range, 29-56 years). Three of the 10 patients had acute onset of symptoms, and the remainder had gradual development of intermittent claudication or groin pain. Only the present case had evidence of rupture. The site of dissection was in the external iliac artery in 8 patients and the common iliac artery in 2 patients. Anatomic bypass or interposition of the diseased artery was performed in 8 patients; the others received conservative treatment. There was no mortality in the 9 previously reported cases. Fatal acute dissection and rupture of the common iliac artery occurred in a patient with FMD, even though the clinical course of this disease is relatively benign. FMD should be considered the cause of dissection and rupture of the iliac artery in a patient with symptoms but of non-atherosclerotic age.",

Traditional surgical repair of carotid pseudoaneurysms is often technically demanding, and is associated with relatively high morbidity and mortality. Endovascular stent grafts have been used to treat both posttraumatic and postoperative carotid pseudoaneurysms.

Endoluminal stents were deployed uneventfully in the other two. At 12 month follow-up, one patient had an occlusion of the stent. While endoluminal therapy of carotid PSAs in an effective method to exclude PSAs, embolization of thrombus is a potential hazard.

    "abstract": "The development of neointimal hyperplasia with subsequent atherosclerotic deposition has been proposed to cause most late vein graft failures. Our unit has previously demonstrated that placement of a macroporous, loose-fitting polyester external stent prevents neointimal thickening in porcine vein grafts, and has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to prevent late vein graft failure. To reduce any potential long-term complications of the permanent polyester stent, a study was undertaken to investigate the effect of a biodegradable external stent on porcine vein graft thickening at 1 month and to identify its longer term effects at 6 months.\nBilateral saphenous vein to common carotid artery interposition grafting was performed in Large White pigs (25-32 kg; n = 6 per time course group) according to UK Home Office guidelines. A commercially constructed loose-fitting 8-mm-diameter polyglactin stent was placed externally around the vein graft on one side, and the contralateral side remained unstented to serve as control. The external stent was designed to biodegrade and hence disappear within 90 days. Grafts were left in situ for 1 month in 1 group of animals, and for up to 6 months in the other group, before explantation. Graft morphometric features were assessed with computer-aided planimetry.\nAt 1 month the vein grafts fitted with the polyglactin stent demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in neointimal thickening (0.038 mm; interquartile range [IQR], 0.035-0.039 mm) compared with the unstented control grafts (0.13 mm; IQR; 0.11-0.19; P = .0012), and also in medial thickening (0.09 mm; IQR, 0.086-0.093) compared with unsheathed control grafts (0.302 mm; IQR, 0.272-0.414; P = .0012). The 6-month polyglactin stented grafts also demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in neointimal thickening (0.049 mm; IQR, 0.047-0.07; P = .0012) compared with control grafts (0.178 mm; IQR, 0.164-0.19), and also in medial thickening (0.105 mm; IQR, 0.095-0.143) compared with unstented grafts (0.421 mm; IQR, 0.35-0.44; P = .0012, Mann-Whitney U test).\nThe loose-fitting biodegradable polyglactin external stent reduces porcine vein graft thickening at 1 month, which persists in the long term, even after degradation of the stent itself. This effective removal of the stent may therefore reduce the long-term risks for infection and mechanical complications associated with implanted prosthetic material while still eliciting the primary objective of preventing graft thickening over the long term. Biodegradable external stents therefore have potential advantages over permanent stent material in clinical application.\nArteriovenous bypass graft failure has a huge economic effect on health care resources, and a devastating effect o the patient. The attenuation of vein wall thickening, with subsequent luminal narrowing and occlusion, is a major goal in improving the longevity of the venous graft, to reduce secondary percutaneous and surgical interventions. The biodegradable external stent demonstrated in this study has possible clinical applications in bypass procedures with autogenous venous tissue, and represents a novel approach to ameliorating the problem of intimal hyperplasia that plagues these grafts.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common disease with as yet unclear cause. Increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) levels in the plasma and aorta are a consistent finding in AAA. Although the role of MMPs in AAA has largely been attributed to degradation of the extracellular matrix proteins, the effects of MMPs on the mechanisms of aortic contraction are unclear. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that MMPs promote aortic dilation by inhibiting the Ca2+ mobilization mechanisms of smooth muscle contraction.\nIsometric contraction and 45Ca2+ influx were measured in aortic strips isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats treated or not treated with MMP-2 and MMP-9.\nIn normal Krebs solution (2.5 mmol/L Ca2+ ) phenylephrine (10-5 mol/L) caused contraction of the aortic strips, which was significantly inhibited (P < .05) by MMP-2 (maximum, 48.9% +/- 5.0%) and to a greater extent by MMP-9 (maximum, 69.8% +/- 6.2%). The MMP-induced inhibition of phenylephrine contraction depended on concentration and time. The inhibitory effects of MMPs on phenylephrine contraction were reversible. In Ca2+ -free (2 mmol/L ethylene glycol bis[beta-aminoethyl ether]-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid) Krebs solution phenylephrine caused a small contraction that was not inhibited by MMP-2 or MMP-9, which suggests that MMPs do not inhibit Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores. Membrane depolarization with 96 mmol/L of potassium chloride, which stimulates Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space, caused a time-dependent and reversible contraction, which was inhibited by MMP-2 and MMP-9. Histologic studies of MMP-treated tissues stained with hematoxylin-eosin or Verhoeff stain for elastin confirmed the absence of degradation of the extracellular matrix. MMP-2 and MMP-9 also caused significant inhibition of 45Ca2+ influx induced by phenylephrine and potassium chloride.\nThese data suggest that MMP-2 and MMP-9 promote aortic dilation by inhibiting the Ca2+ entry mechanism of vascular smooth muscle contraction.\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a slow and progressive disease. The late stages of AAA are characterized by degenerative changes in the extracellular matrix and smooth muscle components of the aortic wall. The present study describes novel inhibitory effects of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) on the Ca2+ entry mechanisms of aortic smooth muscle contraction, even in the absence of extracellular matrix degradation. The MMP-induced inhibition of aortic contraction may further explain the role of increased MMP activity particularly during the early development of AAA. Chronic exposure to MMPs may lead to protracted inhibition of aortic contraction, progressive aortic dilation, and aneurysm formation. MMP-9 is a more potent inhibitor of aortic contraction than MMP-2, consistent with a more dominant role in AAA. Restoration and preservation of smooth muscle contractile function by specific inhibitors of MMPs may represent a new strategy in preventing the progression of small AAA.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and chemokines are mediators of the inflammatory process. The homozygous Delta 32 deletion mutation of the gene of the chemokine receptor CCR5 is a cause of its lack in inflammatory cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between CCR5 Delta 32 deletion mutation and AAA, peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), and carotid stenosis.\nThe CCR5 Delta 32 polymorphism was genotyped in 380 subjects: 70 patients operated on to treat AAA (21 ruptured AAAs, 49 elective repair), 76 patients with PAOD, 62 patients with carotid stenosis, and 172 age-matched and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Risk factors for AAA were considered. Each patient was assessed according to a diagnostic procedure tailored to symptoms at presentation.\nIn patients with AAA the Delta allelic variation was significantly different compared with control subjects (P = .002; odds ratio [OR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41-5.15). The increased presence of this allele differentiates AAA from both PAOD (P = .017; OR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.17-6.52) and carotid stenosis (P = .01; OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.31-9.11). The presence in the genotype of patients with AAA of at least 1 Delta 32 allele is more frequent in ruptured AAAs than in electively repaired AAAs (genotype: OR, 4.04; 95% CI, 1.34-12.1; P = .011; allelic frequency: OR, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.07-7.07; P = .035). Among the patients, multiple regression analysis showed that the Delta 32 allele is an independent risk factor for AAA vs PAOD (OR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.33-7.33; P = .012) and for ruptured AAAs vs electively repaired AAAs (OR, 3.52; 95% CI, 1.01-11.80; P = .045).\nCCR5 Delta 32 deletion mutation is significantly more frequent in patients with AAA than in control subjects and in both patients with PAOD and carotid stenosis, and could be a factor that differentiates AAA from PAOD, and ruptured AAAs from AAAs that can be electively repaired.\nThe major threat of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is rupture, accounting for extremely high mortality. This occurrence has been correlated to aneurysm size, but it is a common observation that small AAAs can rupture and large AAAs can remain stable for many years. This study was carried out in an attempt to search for genetic markers of aneurysm rupture. Some single nucleotide polymorphisms are implicated in acceleration of transcription for enzymes involved in the inflammatory process and in extracellular matrix remodeling. An association between single nucleotide polymorphisms and aneurysm rupture could enable better selection for surgical indications in patients with small AAs and in patients at poor risk with large AAAs.",

    "abstract": "The clinical significance of retrograde collateral arterial perfusion of abdominal aortic aneurysms after endovascular repair (type II endoleak) has not been completely characterized. In this study a canine model was used to analyze intra-aneurysmal pressure, thrombus histologic characteristics, endoleak patency, and radiographic appearance of type II endoleaks originating from single and multiple aneurysm side branches.\nProsthetic aneurysms with an intraluminal solid-state strain-gauge pressure transducer were created in the infrarenal aorta of 14 mongrel dogs. A single collateral side branch was reimplanted in 4 animals, multiple side branches were reimplanted in 6 animals, and no side branches were reimplanted in 4 control animals. Intra-aneurysmal and systemic pressure was measured for 60 to 90 days after creation of the type II endoleak. Endoleak patency and flow were assessed with duplex ultrasound scanning and cine-magnetic resonance angiography. Histologic analysis of the intra-aneurysmal thrombus was also performed.\nStent-graft exclusion reduced intra-aneurysmal pressure significantly in all animals, as compared with systemic pressure (P < .001). All intra-aneurysmal pressure values are indexed to the systemic pressure, and are represented as a percentage of the simultaneously obtained systemic pressure, which has a value of 1.0. Type II endoleaks originating from multiple side branches exhibited significantly increased intra-aneurysmal systolic pressure, mean pressure, and pulse pressure, as compared with endoleaks derived from either a single side branch (systolic pressure: multiple, 0.70 +/- 0.28 vs single, 0.50 +/- 0.19; P < .001; mean pressure: multiple, 0.78 +/- 0.23 vs single, 0.59 +/- 0.22, P < .001; pulse pressure: multiple, 0.41 +/- 0.25 vs single, 0.17 +/- 0.15, P < .001) or excluded control aneurysms that had no side branches and no endoleak (systolic pressure, 0.17 +/- 0.09; mean pressure, 0.14 +/- 0.10; pulse pressure, 0.098 +/- 0.08; P < .001). Cine-magnetic resonance angiograms and duplex ultrasound scans documented persistent patency of multiple branch endoleaks up to the time of euthanasia. In contrast, single side branch endoleaks thrombosed within 3 days (P < .001). Thrombus in the aneurysm sac in close proximity to the endoleak contained intact red blood cells and limited fibrin. Thrombus distant from the endoleak demonstrated extensive fibrin deposition and degraded red blood cells.\nThe canine model may be used to reliably measure intra-aneurysmal pressure in the presence of patent and thrombosed type II endoleaks. In this model 2 or more side branches are necessary to maintain persistent patency of type II endoleaks. These endoleaks are associated with significantly elevated intra-aneurysmal pressure, that is, 70% to 80% of systemic pressure. These results suggest that persistent type II endoleaks have clinical significance.\nEndoleaks originating from retrograde flow in the side branch vessels of the aneurysm generate significant levels of intra-aneurysmal pressure, that is, 70% to 80% of systemic pressure. At least 2 patent side branch vessels appear to be necessary to cause persistent patency of type II endoleak in the canine model. Further studies will be necessary to enable more complete characterization of retrograde endoleaks and to extend these findings to allow clinical application. However, these results suggest that persistently patent type II endoleaks are clinical significance and may require more intensive follow-up intervention.",

In contrast, single side branch endoleaks thrombosed within 3 days (P < .001). Thrombus in the aneurysm sac in close proximity to the endoleak contained intact red blood cells and limited fibrin. Thrombus distant from the endoleak demonstrated extensive fibrin deposition and degraded red blood cells.",

A total of 197 VSRs, 169 GS-CRs, and 78 MSs responded (overall program response rate of 78% for VSRs, 46% for GSRs, 20% for MSs). A scoring system was assigned, with 1.0 the least important and 5.0 the most important reasons to choose or not choose vascular surgery.\nTechnical aspects, role of mentors, and complex decision making involved in vascular surgery were the most important reasons that VSRs, GS-CRs, and MSs would choose vascular surgery as a specialty (average scores > or =4.0 for VSRs and GS-CRs; > or =3.5 for MSs). Responses of GS-CRs and VSRs did not vary significantly between surveys 1 and 2, except endovascular capabilities of vascular surgeons had a more important role in choosing vascular surgery, and future loss of patients to other interventionalists had a more important role in not choosing this specialty in the more recent survey of GS-CRs and VSRs. MSs identified lifestyle as a surgical resident (4.3) and as a surgeon (4.2) as the most important negative factors. A training paradigm consisting of 4 years general surgery + 2 years vascular surgery with a GS certificate was favored by 64% of GS-CRs and 48% of VSRs, compared with a paradigm of 5 years + 2 years with a general surgery certificate, which was favored by 29% of GS-CRs and 25% of VSRs, or 3 years + 3 years without a general surgery certificate, favored by 7% of GS-CRs and 27% of VSRs. Of note, 86% of MSs favored 3 years general surgery + 3 years vascular surgery or 2 years general surgery + 4 years vascular surgery compared with longer general surgery training periods.\nThese findings may help vascular surgery program directors devise strategies to attract future trainees. The importance of mentorship to general surgery junior residents and medical students in choosing vascular surgery cannot be overestimated. Endovascular capabilities of vascular surgeons have an increasingly positive role in career choice by GS-CRs and VSRs, but these residents express increasing concerns about potential loss of patients to other specialists. Lifestyle concerns are the most important reasons why medical students do not choose vascular surgery as a career.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 2 decades the use of thrombolytic therapy in the management of peripheral occlusive diseases, most notably peripheral arterial occlusion (PAO) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT), has become an accepted and potentially preferable alternative to surgery. We examined the period when urokinase was in short supply and subsequently unavailable, to explore potential differences in clinical outcome and economic effect between urokinase and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA).\nData were obtained from the Premier Perspective Database, a broad clinical database that contains information on inpatient medical practices and resource use. The study population included all patients hospitalized in 1999 and 2000 with a primary or secondary diagnosis of PAO or DVT. Incidence was calculated for common adverse events, including bleeding complications, intracranial hemorrhage, amputation, and death. Cost data were also abstracted from the database, and are expressed as mean +/- SD.\nDemographic variables were similar in the urokinase and rt-PA groups. The rate of bleeding complications was similar in the urokinase and rt-PA groups. There were no intracranial hemorrhages in the urokinase group, compared with a rate of 1.5% in the rt-PA PAO group (P = .087) and 1.9% in the rt-PA DVT group (P = .175). The in-hospital mortality rate was lower in the urokinase-treated PAO subgroup (3.6% vs 8.5%; P = .026), but a similar finding in the DVT subgroup did not achieve statistical significance (4% vs 9.8%; P = .069). While pharmacy costs were greater in the urokinase-treated group (US 5472 dollars +/- US 5579 dollars vs US 3644 dollars +/- US 6009 dollars, P < .001; PAO subgroup, US 11,070 dollars +/- US 15,409 dollars vs US 6150 dollars +/- US 12,398 dollars, P = .003), overall hospital costs did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. This finding appears to be explained by a shorter hospital stay and reduced room and board costs in the urokinase-treated group.\nThere were significant differences in outcome in patients with PAO and DVT who received treatment with urokinase and rt-PA. While pharmacy costs were significantly greater when urokinase was used, reduction in length of stay accounted for similar total hospital costs compared with rt-PA. These findings must be considered in the context of the retrospective nature of the analysis and the potential to use dosing regimens that differ from those in this study.",

    "abstract": "The current standard of care for deep venous thromboembolism (DVT) is anticoagulation; however, this treatment method does not rapidly relieve clot burden or clinical symptoms. We describe a rapid and effective method of thrombus removal, with simultaneous percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) and thrombolysis.\nOver 26 months 20 patients (22 men, 2 women; mean age, 52 +/- 6 years [range, 38-79 years]) with extensive lower extremity DVT were treated with PMT with the AngioJet thrombectomy device in combination with lytic agent (urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, or reteplase) added to the infusion. Three patients underwent treatment twice, because of recurrent DVT. The primary end point was angiographic evidence of restoration of venous patency at completion of the procedure. Complications, recurrent ipsilateral DVT, and improvement in clinical symptoms were evaluated.\nComplete thrombus removal was obtained in 15 procedures (65%), and partial resolution in the remaining 8 procedures (35%). Inciting occlusive lesions responsible for acute DVT were revealed in 14 patients (61%), and angioplasty with or without stenting was performed when necessary. In the 8 procedures with partial resolution additional catheter-directed thrombolysis was carried out on average for 5.7 hours, with further thrombus reduction. Overall, immediate (<24 hours) improvement in clinical symptoms was noted in 17 patients (74%). There were no complications related to either PMT or the short duration of lytic agent infusion. At average follow-up of 10.2 +/- 0.3 months (range, 3-26 months), 3 patients had recurrent ipsilateral DVT, and underwent repeat treatment.\nAddition of lytic agent to PMT facilitates thrombus extraction, decreases overall interventional treatment time, and improves patient outcomes. In addition, definitive management of underlying anatomic lesions can be performed in the same setting. Further outcome measures are necessary to study the long-term efficacy of this treatment method on preservation of valve function, reduction of chronic venous insufficiency, and improved quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Patients with multiple trauma often have injuries that preclude the use of anticoagulation therapy or sequential compression device prophylaxis. Temporary inferior vena cava (IVC) filters (IVCFs) offer protection against pulmonary embolism during the early immediate injury and perioperative period, when risk is highest, while averting potential long-term sequelae of permanent IVCFs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic, temporary IVCF placement at the intensive care unit bedside under real-time intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance in patients with multiple trauma.\nNinety-four patients with multiple trauma seen between July 1, 2002, and November 1, 2003, underwent placement of OptEase (Cordis Endovascular) retrievable IVCFs under real-time IVUS guidance. Mean (+/-SD) Injury Severity Score was 25.1 +/- 2.2). Abdominal x-ray films were obtained in all patients to verify filter location. Before IVCF retrieval all patients underwent femoral vein color-flow ultrasound scanning to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pre-procedure and post-procedure vena cavography to identify possible IVCF thrombus entrapment and post-retrieval inferior vena cava injury.\nNineteen patients died of their injuries; no deaths were related to IVCF placement. One pulmonary embolism occurred during follow-up after filter retrieval, and 1 insertion site femoral vein DVT occurred. As verified on abdominal x-ray films, 96.8% (91 of 94) of IVCFs were placed without complications at the L2-3 level. Filter-related complications included 2 groin hematomas (2.1%) and 3 IVCFs misplaced in the right iliac vein (3.2%), early in our experience; the filters were uneventfully retrieved and replaced in the inferior vena cava within 24 hours. Thirty-one patients underwent uneventful retrieval of IVCFs after DVT or pulmonary embolism anticoagulation prophylaxis was initiated. Forty-four filters were not removed, 41 because severity of injury prevented DVT or pulmonary embolism prophylaxis and 3 because of thrombus trapped within the filter.\nProphylactic, temporary IVCF placement at the intensive care unit bedside under IVUS guidance in patients with multiple trauma is simple and safe, and serves as an effective \"bridge\" to anticoagulation therapy until venous thromboembolism prophylaxis can be initiated. Further investigation of this bedside technique and the role of temporary IVCFs in patients with multiple trauma is warranted.\nPatients with multiple trauma often have injuries that preclude the use of anticoagulation therapy or sequential compression device prophylaxis. Temporary inferior vena cava filters (IVCFs) offer protection against pulmonary embolism during the perioperative and immediate injury period, when risk is highest. Ninety-four patients with multiple trauma underwent prophylactic, temporary IVCF placement at the intensive care unit bedside under real-time intravascular ultrasound. One pulmonary embolism occurred during follow-up after filter retrieval, and 1 insertion site femoral vein deep venous thrombosis occurred. Ninety-one of 94 IVCFs (96.8%) were placed without complication. Thirty-one patients underwent uneventful retrieval of IVCFs after anticoagulation prophylaxis was initiated. Forty-four filters were not removed, because of severity of injury (n = 41) or because of trapped thrombus within the filter (n = 3). Prophylactic, temporary IVCFs placed under intravascular ultrasound guidance at the bedside in patients with multiple trauma is simple, safe, and an effective bridge to anticoagulation therapy.",

    "abstract": "Credentialing of vascular surgeons to perform carotid artery stenting (CAS) continues to be a major issue confronting the specialty of Vascular Surgery. Cannulation of aortic arch branches, and placement of carotid antiembolic devices and stents constitute the major technical challenges to vascular surgeons becoming credentialed to perform CAS. The multicenter Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs Stenting Trial (CREST), supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institute of Health, reviews credentials of interventionalists, including surgeons, for the trial's \"lead-in\" phase of CAS to treat symptomatic (>50% stenosis) and asymptomatic (>70% stenosis).\nVascular surgeons requesting participation in CREST must have achieved basic interventional credentialing criteria as recommended by the Society of Vascular Surgery. Each interventionalist is asked to submit notes and narrative summaries from a series of 10 to 30 CAS procedures for review by a multi-specialty review committee before being approved to participate in CREST. Thereafter, during the lead-in phase of CREST, each approved interventionalist is asked to perform CAS procedures using the study devices in as many as 20 patients. In this interim report from the CREST lead-phase, the association of specialty of operator (vascular surgeon, neurosurgeon, other specialist) and periprocedural stroke and death rate was examined in patients undergoing CAS. In addition, current enrollment volume in the lead-in phase by specialty of the principal investigator was examined.\nThirty-two of 134 (23.9%) CREST-credentialed interventionalists are vascular surgeons (n = 22; 16.4%) or neurosurgeons (n = 10; 7.5%). For events monitored through March 31, 2004, 789 patients had undergone CAS procedures performed by these 134 specialists. Thirty-day stroke and death rate was 4.6%, and myocardial infarction was observed in 1.1% of patients. Serious adverse events have not been clustered at individual institutions, and no significant differences have been observed between vascular surgeons or neurosurgeons and other credentialed specialists.\nVascular surgeons with basic catheter and guide wire skills, particularly those who have incorporated diagnostic cerebral angiography into their practice, can be credentialed to perform CAS. Individuals or groups should devote a number of cases (n = 10-30 per surgeon) to CAS to accomplish this goal. Pending US Food and Drug Administration approval of devices and Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services reimbursement, institutional financial support for the performance of these procedures must be secured. The learning curve for CAS should not be considered so formidable as to discourage surgeons from adding these techniques of CAS to their procedural inventory.",

    "abstract": "Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is being evaluated as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for treatment of severe carotid artery stenosis. Because CAS does not require general anesthesia and is less traumatic, it might be especially advantageous in older patients, but data comparing these 2 treatment methods in older patients are scarce.\nThe periprocedural complication rates in 53 patients aged 75 years or older who had undergone protected CAS between June 2001 and April 2004 were compared with those in a group of 110 patients aged 75 years or older who had undergone CEA between January 1997 and December 2001, before widespread introduction of CAS procedures at our institution. All patients were evaluated by a neurologist both before and after surgery. According to the criteria set forth by the large trials the occurrence of minor, major, or fatal stroke, and myocardial infarction within 30 days was determined.\nThe demographic characteristics and indications for an intervention were similar in both treatment groups. Thirty patients (57%) in the CAS group had symptomatic carotid stenosis, compared with 69 patients (63%) in the CEA group. In neither group was there any fatal stroke or myocardial infarction. The 30-day stroke rate was significantly higher in the CAS group (4 minor, 2 major strokes; 11.3%) than in the CEA group (no minor, 2 major strokes; 1.8%; P < .05). Although the 30-day major stroke rate between CAS and CEA groups was comparable (3.8% vs 1.8%; P = 0.6), this effect was mainly attributable to a significantly higher rate of minor stroke in the CAS group (7.5% vs 0%; P < .05).\nDespite the use of cerebral protection devices the neurologic complication rate in patients aged 75 years and older associated with CAS was significantly higher than with CEA performed by highly skilled surgeons at our academic institution. Although this finding is mainly based on a significantly higher rate of minor stroke in the CAS group, the common practice of preferentially submitting older patients to CAS is questionable, and should be abandoned until the results of further randomized trials are available.",

    "abstract": "Carotid duplex scanning is the standard test for documenting carotid disease. Carotid endarterectomy effectively reduces stroke in selected patients with carotid artery disease. Data from large national randomized trials suggest that the benefits of CEA may be gender dependent. Because many diagnoses are made and treatment is based on the results of carotid duplex ultrasound scanning alone, it is important to determine whether different diagnostic thresholds should be used in men and women. The purpose of this study was 2-fold: to examine whether there is an overall gender difference in carotid velocity at similar arteriographic stenoses, and to determine whether there are significant differences at clinically relevant thresholds of disease.\nA database of 938 carotid arteriogram entries was established prospectively, with accompanying measurements of peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV). The percent of internal carotid artery stenosis seen on arteriograms was calculated according to criteria from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. Analyses were made in 536 carotid arteries in men and 402 carotid arteries in women. In addition, the single most diseased artery per patient was analyzed by gender. PSV and EDV were averaged for data subsets according to 10% intervals of internal carotid artery stenoses. Velocity for each interval was compared between men and women with the Student t test. Receiver operator characteristic curves were developed to define optimal duplex criteria for 60% and 70% stenosis.\nFor all intervals, PSV and EDV averaged 9% and 6% higher, respectively, in women than in men. Significant gender differences existed between PSV and EDV for 60% and 70% stenosis (P = .03). When a single vessel per patient was analyzed these observations persisted, but lost significance for PSV at 60% stenosis (P = .18). Receiver operator characteristic curves at 90% sensitivity demonstrated that optimal PSV for 60% stenosis was 160 cm/s and 180 cm/s, and for 70% stenosis was 185 cm/s and 202 cm/s, in male and female patients, respectively.\nWomen have higher carotid blood flow velocity than men do. Gender differences exist, and are notably different at clinically relevant thresholds for intervention. These data indicate that different criteria should be used for interpreting carotid velocity profiles in women than in men, and have potentially important implications for patient care.",

    "abstract": "In this preliminary study we tested the effect of short-term carbohydrate supplementation on carbohydrate oxidation and walking performance in peripheral arterial disease.\nEleven patients with peripheral arterial disease and intermittent claudication and 8 healthy control subjects completed several weeks of baseline exercise testing, then were given supplementation for 3 days with a carbohydrate solution and placebo. Maximal walking time was assessed with a graded treadmill test. Carbohydrate oxidation during a submaximal phase of this test was measured with indirect calorimetry. At the end of baseline testing a biopsy specimen was taken from the gastrocnemius muscle, and the active fraction of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity was determined.\nCarbohydrate supplementation resulted in a significant increase in body weight and carbohydrate oxidation during exercise in patients with intermittent claudication and control subjects. Maximal walking time decreased by 3% in control subjects, whereas it increased by 6% in patients with intermittent claudication (group x treatment interaction, P < .05). There was a wide range of performance responses to carbohydrate supplementation among patients with claudication (-3%-37%). This effect was greater in poorer performers, and was negatively correlated (P < .05) with muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity.\nPreliminary data suggest that carbohydrate oxidation during exercise might contribute to exercise intolerance in more dysfunctional patients with intermittent claudication and that carbohydrate supplementation might be an effective therapeutic intervention in these patients.",

We compared heparin-bonded Dacron (HBD) with PTFE in a randomized multicenter clinical trial.\nOver 28 months, 209 patients (179 above-knee disease, 30 below-knee disease) were randomized to receive HBD (n = 106) or PTFE (n = 103) grafts. Aspirin, 300 mg/d, was started before surgery, and was continued if tolerated.\nAt follow-up for a minimum of 5 years (mean, 76 months; range, 60-89 months), 37 patients (17.7%) had died with patent grafts and 121 (58%) grafts were occluded. Primary patency rate, measured with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, was 46% (95% confidence interval [CI], 35%-57%) at year 5 for HBD, compared with 35% for PTFE (CI, 25%-45%; P < .055). Long-term patency was achieved in only 4 of 78 interventions performed in 55 thrombosed grafts. Secondary patency rate for HBD was 47% (CI, 36%-58%), and for PTFE was 36% (CI, 26%-46%).

    "abstract": "We sought to determine the long-term results of revision procedures performed for repair of stenotic lesions in infrainguinal vein bypass grafts.\nA retrospective review of 188 vein grafts, from a total series of 1260 bypasses, undergoing revision of stenotic lesions between January 1, 1987, and December 31, 2002, at Brigham & Women's Hospital was undertaken. Lesions were identified by recurrence of symptoms, change in examination findings, or with routine duplex ultrasound graft surveillance. Demographic and medical risk factors, and surgical variables were analyzed with respect to patency outcomes after the initial graft revision, with descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and life table analysis. Primary and secondary patency rates were determined from the time of graft revision.\nPatients included 108 men (57%) and 80 women (42%) who underwent revision at a mean age of 67.8 years. One hundred thirty grafts required only a single revision, whereas 58 required subsequent additional revisions. Revision procedures included 99 vein patches (52.7%), 23 jump grafts (12.2%), 23 interposition grafts (12.2%), 8 transpositions to new outflow vessels (4.3%), and 35 balloon angioplasty procedures (18.6%). During a mean follow-up of 1535 days, 5-year primary patency rate was 49.3% +/- 4.5% (SE) and 5-year secondary patency rate was 80.3% +/- 3.6%. There was no difference in patency rate for different revision procedures, type of vein graft, indication for the original procedure, or for patients with diabetes mellitus or renal disease. The overall limb salvage rate was 83.2% +/- 3.5% 5 years after graft revision. With COX proportional hazard analysis of time to failure of the revision procedure, the outflow level of the original bypass and the time of revision proved to be an important predictor of durability of the graft revision. Revision of popliteal bypass grafts resulted in a 60% 5-year primary patency rate, whereas revision of tibial grafts resulted in a 42% 5-year primary patency rate (P = .004; hazard ratio [HR], 2.06). Five-year secondary patency rates were 90% and 76%, respectively (P = .009; HR = 3.43). The timing of the graft revision proved an additional predictor. Grafts revised within 6 months of the index operation had lower primary patency than those with later revisions (42.9% vs 80.7%, respectively; HR = 1.754; P = .0152).\nVein graft revisions offer durable patency and limb salvage rates after repair of stenotic infrainguinal bypass grafts. Vigilant ongoing surveillance is essential, because 30.9% of revised grafts will develop additional lesions that will require repair. Tibial level bypass grafts that require early repeat intervention to treat graft stenosis are at particular risk for development of subsequent lesions.",

    "abstract": "While decision analysis and treatment algorithms have repeatedly been shown to improve quality of care in many areas of medicine, no such algorithm has emerged for the invasive management of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease. Using the best available evidence-based outcomes data, our group designed a standardization tool, the Lower Extremity Grading System (LEGS) score, which consistently directs limbs to a specific treatment on the basis of presentation. The purpose of this study was to examine whether use of such a tool improves outcomes by directing treatment of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease.\nOver 18 months (July 2001-December 2002) our group intervened in 673 limbs (angioplasty, open surgery, primary limb amputation) with lower extremity peripheral arterial disease. During this time we developed the LEGS score, and implemented its prospective use for the final 362 limbs. For the purpose of this study, all 673 limbs were retrospectively scored with the LEGS score to determine the LEGS recommended best treatment. Of the 673 limbs, 551 (81.9%) received the same treatment as recommended with LEGS and 122 (18.1%) received treatment contrary to LEGS. Limbs treated contrary to LEGS (cases) were then compared with matched control limbs (treated according to LEGS), with similar angiographic findings, clinical presentation, preoperative functional status, comorbid conditions and operative technical factors. Outcomes measured at 6 months included arterial reconstruction patency, limb salvage, survival, and maintenance of ambulatory status and independent living status. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess patency, limb salvage, and survival; associated survival curves were compared with the log-rank test. Functional outcomes were compared with the Fisher exact test.\nAfter matching case limbs with control limbs, 9 limbs had no control match. Thus 113 limbs in 100 patients treated contrary to LEGS were compared with 113 limbs in 100 patients treated according to LEGS. Limbs treated contrary to LEGS resulted in significantly inferior outcomes at 6 months for measures of primary patency (57.5% vs 84.3%; P < .001), secondary patency (73.2% vs 96.2%; P < .001), limb salvage (89.7% vs 97.2%; P = .04), and maintenance of ambulatory status (78% vs 92%; P = .02). As an additional finding, 29.6% (92 of 311) of interventions performed before implementation of the algorithm were treated contrary to LEGS, and thus contrary to objectively determined best therapy, compared with 8.3% (30 of 362) after LEGS implementation (P < .001).\nLimbs treated according to our standardization tool resulted in better outcomes compared with limbs treated contrary to the algorithm. These data suggest that routine use of an appropriately validated treatment standardization algorithm is capable of improving overall results for invasive treatment of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease.",

    "abstract": "We describe our experience with a new technique of total laparoscopic bypass surgery to treat aortoiliac occlusive lesions.\nFrom November 2000 to December 2003, 93 total laparoscopic bypass procedures were performed to treat TASC (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus document) grade C or D aortoiliac occlusive lesions. We also reimplanted 2 inferior mesenteric arteries, and performed 3 prosthesis-superior mesenteric bypasses and 2 suprarenal aorta endarterectomies. Our technique includes a sloping right lateral decubitus installation, which enables a simple transperitoneal left retrocolic or retrorenal approach to the infrarenal abdominal aorta. In patients with a hostile abdomen a retroperitoneal videoscopic approach was used. Aorta-prosthesis laparoscopic anastomoses are performed simply, which averts any trauma to the suture material.\nPatients included 76 men and 17 women, with median patient age 61 years (range, 38-79 years). The approach to the aorta was always possible, in particular, in obese patients. It enabled stable aortic exposure during performance of the laparoscopic aorta-prosthesis anastomosis. Median operative time was 240 minutes (range, 150-450 minutes). Median aortic clamping time measured to unclamping of the first prosthetic limb was 67.5 minutes (range, 30-135 minutes). Median duration of aorta-prosthesis anastomosis was 30 minutes (range, 12-90 minutes). The longest durations were mainly observed during the learning curve. Thirty-day postoperative mortality was 4% (4 of 93 patients). Two patients died of myocardial infarction. One patient with American Society of Anesthesiologists grade 4 disease operated on to treat critical ischemia died of multiple organ system failure, and 1 patient died of colonic ischemia. Major nonlethal postoperative complications were observed in 4 patients, and included lung atelectasia in 2 patients, graft infection in 1 patient operated on emergently to treat aortic occlusion, and secondary spleen rupture at day 5 in 1 patient. Median hospital stay was 7 days (range, 2-57 days). With a mean follow-up of 19 months (range, 1-37 months), complete recovery was observed in 89 patients, and all grafts were patent. One patient had kinking of a prosthetic limb at the groin, and in 1 patient Staphylococcus epidermidis graft infection developed, which was treated with in situ replacement with a rifampin-bonded graft.\nTotal laparoscopic aortic bypass is feasible. In patients with TASC C and D aortoiliac occlusive lesions, short-term outcomes are comparable to those with conventional aortic bypass. After the initial learning curve, laparoscopic technique may reduce the operative trauma of aortic bypass.",

    "abstract": "Family history is an independent risk factor for premature acute myocardial infarction; in contrast, familial risk for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) has yet to be determined. Elevated levels of hemostatic proteins are consistently predictive for cardiovascular risk in \"healthy\" subjects, and may cluster with underlying insulin resistance. Atherothrombotic risk factor clustering occurs in first-degree relatives of subjects with coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. These may contribute to the enhanced cardiovascular risk in these subjects, and we hypothesised that familial clustering may occur in PAD. The objective of this study was to measure atherothrombotic risk factors in healthy male first-degree relatives of men with intermittent claudication, with emphasis on thrombotic risk.\nOne hundred sixty-five healthy male first-degree relatives were compared with control subjects matched for age, sex, and race (n = 165), free from a personal or family history of premature cardiovascular disease. Primary outcome measures were fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, factor VII clotting activity (FVII:C), and factor XIII levels. Atherosclerotic risk factors were measured, and subjects were genotyped for common functional polymorphisms (factor VII r353q and fibrinogen B beta-455).\nRelatives had higher mean levels of fibrinogen (3.04 vs 2.89 g/L; P = .021), FVII:C (117% vs 104%; P = .000), factor XIII B subunit (1.11 vs 1.01 IU/mL; P = .000), and complex (A 2 B 2 ; 1.18 vs 1.11 IU/mL; P = .021). At multivariate analysis the association between relative status and fibrinogen, FVII:C, and factor XIII B subunit levels were independent of other variables.\nThe healthy male relatives of men with PAD have elevated levels of fibrinogen, factor VII, and factor XIII. Our results support the existence of thrombotic risk factor clustering in this population at \"high risk.\"",

    "abstract": "Popliteal aneurysms (PAs) often are treated with exclusion and bypass. However, excluded aneurysms can transmit systemic pressure from persistent flow through collateral arteries (endoleak), resulting in aneurysm growth and rupture. We used duplex ultrasound scanning for postoperative surveillance more than 2 years after PA repair with exclusion and bypass, to determine the presence of flow and aneurysm growth.\nFrom 1995 to 2001, 23 patients with 26 PAs (mean diameter, 3.2 cm; range, 1.6-5.6 cm) underwent surgical repair and were available for more than 2 years of follow-up. The popliteal artery was ligated proximal and distal to the aneurysm, and autogenous revascularization was performed. All patients who underwent PA endoaneurysmorrhaphy through a posterior approach were excluded from the study. During long-term follow-up, aneurysm sac flow and size were evaluated with duplex ultrasound scanning, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance angiography, and standard angiography. Patients with increased PA size and persistent flow were offered repair through a posterior approach.\nOver 7 years, 26 PAs (symptomatic, 11; asymptomatic, 15) treated with aneurysm exclusion and bypass were available for more than 2 years of follow-up (mean, 38 months; range, 24-78 months). In the postoperative period 16 PAs (62%) became thrombosed, 10 (38%) had persistent collateral flow through geniculate vessels, 6 (23%) increased in size, and 3 (12%) ruptured; 1 (4%) resulted in limb loss. Operative findings for all ruptured PAs and 3 of 6 PAs with increased sac size that underwent aneurysm sac exploration and endoaneurysmorrhaphy revealed retrograde flow through geniculate vessels, mimicking type II endoleak.\nThese findings question the effectiveness of PA exclusion through proximal or distal ligation and bypass. In addition, retrograde flow into the aneurysm sac (ie, type II endoleak after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair) may transmit systemic pressure that can result in aneurysm rupture. We recommend PA treatment with aneurysm sac decompression and ligation of geniculate vessels whenever possible and routine postoperative surveillance of the excluded aneurysm sac.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular stent-graft placement is replacing traditional surgery in type B aortic dissection. Usually stent-graft implantation is performed under fluoroscopic and angiographic guidance, but this relatively new procedure is still burdened with some complications. We investigated the value of a developed algorithm based on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for guiding stent-graft implantation in type B aortic dissection.\nForty-two patients with type B aortic dissection (chronic in 28 patients with aneurysmal dilatation of the false lumen, and acute complicated in 14 patients) underwent endovascular stent-graft reconstruction of the descending thoracic aorta. TEE was always performed after angiography. TEE-induced variations of the procedure, based on the algorithm, were compared with initial angiography-based decisions.\nTEE was decisive for guidewire repositioning (not possible with fluoroscopy) from the false to the true lumen in 3 patients and for correct guidewire entrance in an elephant trunk prosthesis in another patient. After stent-graft implantation color Doppler TEE enabled detection of proximal peri-stent leaks in 13 patients, whereas only 6 (46%) of the 13 leaks were detectable at angiography (P = .008). Most leaks were subsequently eliminated with balloon dilation or further stent grafting. Pulsed Doppler TEE was also useful for differentiating true leaks (13 patients) from Dacron porosity (7 patients). A pulsed-Doppler velocity cutoff value of 50 cm/s enabled differentiation of Dacron porosity (characterized by slow blood flow) from true peri-stent leak (fast flow). After stent-graft implantation TEE demonstrated new intimal tears in the thoracic aorta in 7 patients, whereas only 2 of the 7 new tears were detectable at angiography (P = .024); in 6 of 7 patients the new distal tears were subsequently resolved with placement of additional stents, whereas in a patient with Marfan syndrome new proximal tears determined a type I endoleak, which could not be resolved. Overall, TEE furnished decisive information additional to angiography in determining successful procedural changes in 16 of 42 patients (38%). There were no in-hospital deaths, and pre-discharge spiral computed tomograms showed a good outcome of stent-graft implantation in 37 of 42 patients (88%), with 5 residual type I endoleaks, all previously detected with TEE but impossible to eliminate with either balloon molding or further stent implantation. All but 2 patients (95%) are currently alive at mean follow-up of 30 +/- 18 months.\nTEE algorithm is an easy and useful tool in the operating room to guide correct stent-graft positioning in type B aortic dissection.",

    "abstract": "Blunt traumatic thoracic aortic rupture is a life-threatening surgical emergency associated with high mortality and morbidity. The recent development of endovascular stent-graft prostheses offers a potentially less invasive alternative to open chest surgery, especially in patients with associated injuries. We sought to compare the results of conventional surgical repair and endovascular treatment of traumatic aortic rupture in a single center.\nFrom July 1998 to January 2004, 20 patients with acute blunt traumatic aortic rupture underwent treatment at our institution. All patients had a lesion limited to the isthmus, and associated injuries. Initial management included fluid resuscitation, treatment of other severe associated lesions, and strict monitoring of blood pressure. Eleven patients (9 men, 2 women; mean age, 32 years) underwent surgical repair, including direct suturing in 6 patients and graft interposition in 5 patients. Ten patients were operated on with cardiopulmonary support (left bypass with centrifugal pump, n = 2; extracorporeal circulation, n = 8). The delay between trauma and surgery was 2.6 days (range, 0-21 days). Nine patients (8 men, 1 woman; mean age, 32 years) underwent endovascular treatment with commercially available devices (Excluder, n = 2; Talent, n = 7). In all patients 1 stent graft was deployed. In 2 patients the left subclavian artery was intentionally covered with the device. The delay between trauma and endovascular treatment was 17.8 days (range, 1-68 days).\nOne patient in the surgical group (9.1%) died during the intervention. Three surgical complications occurred in 3 patients (27%), including left phrenic nerve palsy (n = 1), left-sided recurrent nerve palsy (n = 1), and hemopericardium 16 days after surgery that required a repeat intervention (n = 1). No patient in this group had paraplegia. In the endovascular group successful stent-graft deployment was achieved in all patients, with no conversion to open repair. No patient died, and no procedure-related complications, including paraplegia, occurred in this group. Control computed tomography scans obtained within 7 days after endovascular treatment showed exclusion of pseudoaneurysm in all cases. Length of follow-up for endovascular treatment ranged from 3 to 41 months (mean, 15.1 months). Computed tomography scans obtained 3 months after endovascular treatment showed complete disappearance of pseudoaneurysm in all patients.\nIn the treatment of blunt traumatic thoracic aortic rupture, the immediate outcome in patients who receive endovascular stent grafts appears to be at least as good as observed after conventional surgical repair. Long-term follow-up is necessary to assess long-term effectiveness of such management.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this single-center study was to compare findings at presentation and surgical outcome in patients in whom abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) ruptured after endovascular repair and patients in whom AAAs ruptured before any treatment, over a defined period.\nFrom May 1992 to September 2003, 1043 patients underwent elective repair of intact infrarenal AAAs. Endovascular repair was performed in 609 patients, and open repair in 434 patients. Eighteen of 609 patients (3%) who underwent endovascular AAA repair required treatment because of rupture of the aneurysm after a mean of 29 months (group 1). During the same 11-year period, another 91 patients without previous treatment required urgent repair of a ruptured AAA (group 2). Rupture was diagnosed at contrast material-enhanced computed tomography or by presence of extramural extravasation of blood at open repair. Except for a higher incidence of women in group 2, patients in both groups were similar with regard to demographics and clinical characteristics but differed in findings at presentation. Eight patients in group 1 had a known endoleak before AAA rupture, whereas contrast-enhanced computed tomography, performed in 15 patients at presentation, demonstrated an endoleak in all. Hypotension (systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg) was noted at presentation in 4 of 18 patients (22%) in group 1 and 76 of 91 patients (84%) in group 2. All patients underwent open repair via a transperitoneal approach, except for 4 patients in group 1 and 3 patients in group 2 who underwent endovascular repair of ruptured AAAs.\nThe proportion of patients with hypotension at presentation in group 1 (4 of 18) was significantly less than in group 2 (76 of 91; P < .01). The difference in perioperative (30 day) mortality rate in group 1 (3 of 18; 16.6%) compared with group 2 (49 of 91; 53.8%) was also significant (P < .01). The outcome in group 1 was therefore superior to that in group 2.\nThis study confirms that endovascular AAA repair complicated by endoleak does not prevent rupture. The data suggest, however, that rupture, when it occurs in these circumstances, may not be accompanied by such major hemodynamic changes and high mortality as rupture of an untreated AAA. Further long-term follow-up and analysis in a larger group of patients are required to confirm the apparent intermediate level of protection afforded by failed endovascular repair, which does not prevent rupture but enhances survival after operation to treat rupture, possibly by ameliorating the hemodynamic changes associated with the rupture process.",

Results were assessed with contrast material-enhanced CT scans and plain abdominal x-ray studies at 1, 6, and 12 months, and annually postoperatively.\nPatients were followed up for a mean of 22 months (median, 24 months). Technical success was achieved in 97.9% of patients, with 4 failed insertions (3 early conversions because of deployment issues, 1 access failure). There were no significant differences in mortality between the Powerlink and control groups, and only 1 death was procedure-related. Blood loss (341 mL vs 1583 mL; P < .0001), operative time (136 minutes vs 222 minutes; P < .0001), intensive care unit stay (0.78 days vs 4.1 days; P < .0001), and hospital length of stay (3.3 days vs 9.5 days; P < .0001) were significantly less in the Powerlink cohort compared with the control group. There were significantly fewer adverse events (myocardial infarction, P = .0131; renal failure, P = .0042; gastrointestinal complications, P = .0125) in the perioperative period in the Powerlink cohort compared with the control group, but in the longer follow-up interval adverse event-free survival was equivalent between groups (P = .456, log-rank test). At the time of the first-month CT scan, endoleaks were noted in 25 patients, yielding a 30-day endoleak rate of 22.7%. Type II endoleaks predominated, and there were no type III or IV endoleaks. Secondary procedures were performed in 19 patients (10%), for treatment of endoleak (n = 10), limb obstruction (n = 7), and other causes (n = 2). There were 3 graft migrations (2.2%), 1 of which resulted in an endoleak. There were no ruptures, graft fabric defects, or wire fractures. Significant reduction in mean AAA diameter and volume was noted at every follow-up interval. Increase in AAA diameter was noted in only 1.5% of patients at 24 months.\nThe Powerlink system appears safe, and effectively protects patients from AAA rupture over the intermediate term. The graft and stent materials have thus far been free from failure and fatigue. Percutaneous contralateral limb access facilitates graft placement in patients with disadvantaged access routes. Endovascular aneurysm repair with the Powerlink system produces significantly fewer early adverse events compared with open AAA repair, but mortality is equivalent with both procedures. Careful follow-up over the longer term is necessary to ensure the durability of these results.",

    "abstract": "We compared the effectiveness and clinical outcome of open repair versus endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) in achieving prevention of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)-related death and graft-related complications.\nOver 7 years from 1997 to 2003, 1119 consecutive patients underwent elective treatment of infrarenal AAAs, 585 with open repair and 534 with EVAR. Patients were regularly followed up at 1, 6, 12 months, and every 6 months thereafter, in EVAR group, and at 3 and 12 months, and yearly thereafter after open repair. Preoperative, intraoperative, and follow-up data were stored in a prospective database.\nMedian follow-up was similar in the 2 groups: 33 months (interquartile range [IQR], 13-50 months) in the EVAR group vs 35 months (IQR, 15-54 months) in the open repair group. EVAR group patients were older than patients in the open repair group: 73 years vs 72 years (P = .04). There were statistical significant differences between the EVAR group and the open repair group with respect to AAA median diameter (52 mm vs 56 mm), coronary disease rate (46% vs 37%; P = .001), pulmonary disease rate (56% vs 38%; P < .0001), and American Society of Anesthesiologists IV score rate (16% vs 6%; P < .0001). Thirty-day mortality in the EVAR group was 0.9% (5 of 534 patients), compared with 4.1% (24 of 585 patients; P = .001) in the open repair group, and major morbidity was 9.1% (49 of 534 patients) vs 18.6% (109 of 585 patients; P < .0001), respectively. The incidence of secondary procedures in the EVAR group was 15.7%, compared with 3% in the open repair group (P < .0001). There were no deaths related to secondary procedures in either group. Six AAAs (1.1%) ruptured after EVAR, 3 of which were fatal; in the open repair group 1 patient (0.2%) underwent successful repeat operatation to treat iliac pseudoaneurysm rupture 5 years after the original procedure. Kaplan-Meier estimates for freedom from aneurysm-related death at 84 months were 97.5% in the EVAR group and 95.9% in the open repair group (log rank test, P = .008). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates at 84 months were 67.1% in the open repair group and 66.9% in the EVAR group (P = NS). At the same interval the risk for secondary procedures was 49.4% for the EVAR group and 7.1% for the open repair group. Of the 11 variables analyzed with logistic analysis, open surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-54.2; P = .002), American Society of Anesthesiologists IV score (HR, 7.1; 95% CI, 2.7-18.8; P = .0001), and age (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.04-1.13; P = .04) were positive independent predictors of perioperative mortality.\nOur data suggest that at a maximum follow-up of 7 years, patients who undergo EVAR show lower perioperative and late aneurysm-related mortality compared with a younger and substantially healthier group of patients with aneurysms treated with open repair. The higher need for secondary procedures in the endovascular group did not affect superiority of the overall performance of EVAR in the early and late intervals.",

    "abstract": "The CEAP classification for chronic venous disorders (CVD) was developed in 1994 by an international ad hoc committee of the American Venous Forum, endorsed by the Society for Vascular Surgery, and incorporated into \"Reporting Standards in Venous Disease\" in 1995. Today most published clinical papers on CVD use all or portions of CEAP. Rather than have it stand as a static classification system, an ad hoc committee of the American Venous Forum, working with an international liaison committee, has recommended a number of practical changes, detailed in this consensus report. These include refinement of several definitions used in describing CVD; refinement of the C classes of CEAP; addition of the descriptor n (no venous abnormality identified); elaboration of the date of classification and level of investigation; and as a simpler alternative to the full (advanced) CEAP classification, introduction of a basic CEAP version. It is important to stress that CEAP is a descriptive classification, whereas venous severity scoring and quality of life scores are instruments for longitudinal research to assess outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is on the verge of becoming an established imaging tool in the fields of clinical oncology, cardiology, and neurology. Because of the high glucose uptake of inflammatory cells, FDG scanning is an appropriate tool for use in tracing suspected inflammation or to evaluate infection. PET, although highly sensitive, often lacks the ability to define the precise anatomic location of abnormal FDG accumulation. The new PET/computed tomography (CT) technology provides precise registration of metabolic and structural imaging data in a single session. We report positive FDG-PET/CT findings in an infected vascular prosthesis 6 months after grafting. Our experience and a few available case reports support the hypothesis that FDG-PET/CT may have a promising role in future noninvasive diagnosis of infected vascular grafts.",

We postulate that an arterial autograft is a theoretically superior conduit to traditional saphenous vein, and report reconstruction with inferior epigastric artery. Three adult male smokers, ages 39 to 49 years, had severe digital ischemia and cold-induced vasospasm. Arteriograms confirmed occlusion of the distal ulnar artery without direct perfusion of the superficial palmar arch, distal digital artery embolization, and normal proximal vasculature. All reconstructions were performed from the distal most patent ulnar artery at the wrist to the superficial palmar arch (1 patient) or sequentially to the involved common digital arteries (2 patients), with inferior epigastric artery. Handling characteristics and size match between the arterial autografts and bypassed arteries was excellent. Patency has been confirmed with duplex scanning at follow-up of 8 to 24 months, with resolution of cold intolerance and successful digital preservation.",

We report a successful endovascular repair of an aneurysm of the ductus diverticulum with the Inoue branched stent graft. In a 78-year-old woman, an abnormal shadow was noted at the aortopulmonary window on a chest x-ray film. A computed tomography scan demonstrated a 3.8-cm saccular aneurysm, which protruded inferiorly from the distal end of the aortic arch. The aneurysm was considered an aneurysm of the ductus diverticulum, and surgery was required. However, the patient was considered at high risk for respiratory dysfunction with conventional open surgery. Endovascular repair with an Inoue single-branched stent graft was performed with the patient under local anesthesia, successfully and without complication or endoleak. To our knowledge, this is the first report of endovascular treatment of an aneurysm of the ductus diverticulum.",

    "abstract": "To eliminate occasional tilting of the original bioprosthetic venous valve (BVV) a second-generation BVV has been developed. This study was performed to evaluate deployment, stability, and short-term function of the second-generation BVV in an animal model.\nA second-generation percutaneously placed BVV consisting of a square stent and lyophilized small intestinal submucosa attached to a second square stent (DS BVV) or Z-stent (ZS BVV) were tested. DS BVVs (n = 32) were constructed with a nitinol (n = 28) or stainless steel double stent (n = 4), and ZS BVVs (n = 16) were made of nitinol (n = 8) or stainless steel (n = 4). BVVs were implanted percutaneously through a femoral vein approach into the jugular vein in 24 female sheep with an over-the-wire 13F or 10F delivery system. All BVVs were placed across the natural valve of the proximal jugular vein. Deployment, stability, and function of BVVs were studied at immediate venography with contrast medium injections peripheral and central to the BVVs. Animals underwent follow-up venography and were sacrificed at 6 weeks (n = 24). Gross pathologic examination was performed.\nJugular vein diameter ranged from 9.8 to 14.4 mm (mean, 12.1 +/- 1.2 mm) in 24 sheep. The 10-mm to 12-mm valve was deployed in 27 jugular veins, and the 12-mm to 14-mm valve was deployed in 21 jugular veins. No tilting was seen at placement of 48 BVVs into the jugular veins, and all valves exhibited good function on immediate venograms. Angiographic competency for the nitinol and stainless steel ZS BVV (100%) was similar to that for the nitinol DS BVV (92.3%; P = .488) but was significantly better than for the stainless steel DS BVV at 6 weeks (50%; P = .03). Dysfunction of 4 valves was caused by either nitinol DS BVV oversizing (n = 2) or intimal hyperplasia with the stainless steel DS BVV (n = 2).\nPlacement without tilting appears essential for proper valve function. The second-generation BVV enables placement without tilting. Exact matching of valve size with vein diameter is necessary for good valve function.\nAt present there are no widely accepted surgical or percutaneous treatment options for deep chronic venous insufficiency. A manufactured, percutaneously implantable, nonimmunogenic and nonthrombogenic bioprosthetic venous valve that remains patent and competent over time is an attractive alternative to direct venous valve reconstruction or transplantation. our results and the potential for effective treatment with bioprosthetic venous valves warrants clinical research in carefully selected patients and may lead to an effective, minimally invasive treatment for deep chronic venous invasive treatment for deep chronic venous insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "Curcumin, a yellow polyphenolic compound from the plant Curcuma ionga , is a commonly used spice and coloring agent with beneficial effects of anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of curcumin on homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction in a porcine coronary artery model.\nPorcine coronary arteries were cut into 5-mm rings, which were incubated for 24 hours either as control rings, with homocysteine (50 micromol/L), curcumin (5 micromol/L), or a combination of curcumin (5 micromol/L) and homocysteine (50 micromol/L). Myograph tension analysis was performed in response to vessel active drugs including thromboxane A2 analog U466419 (contraction), endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation (bradykinin), and endothelium-independent vasorelaxation (sodium nitroprusside). Immunohistochemical staining was performed for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In addition, superoxide anion production was determined by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence.\nAll groups of porcine coronary artery rings showed no difference in maximal contraction after U46619 challenge. However, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in response to 10(-5) mol/L bradykinin was 40% in the homocysteine-treated group, as compared to 73% in the control group (P = .03). Of importance, curcumin could effectively block homocysteine-induced impairment of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. All groups showed no difference in endothelium-independent vasorelaxation. In addition, eNOS immunoreactivity was reduced in the homocysteine group, but the combined homocysteine and curcumin group showed eNOS levels comparable to those in the control group. Furthermore, superoxide anion levels of the endothelial layer were significantly increased by 2-fold in homocysteine-treated vessels as compared to control vessels (P = .02), whereas curcumin could block the effect of homocysteine on superoxide anion production.\nThese data demonstrate that curcumin effectively reverses the endothelial dysfunction induced by homocysteine. In addition, curcumin significantly blocked homocysteine-induced superoxide anion production and eNOS down-regulation. This study suggests a therapeutic role for dietary curcumin in patients with homocysteinemia, thereby reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.\nHyperhomocysteinemia is a significant clinical problem. It is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. This study provides new information for better understanding the molecular mechanisms of homocysteine-induced vascular injury. More importantly, curcumin, a natural substance, can effectively block the detrimental effect of homocysteine on the vascular system. Thus curcumin could be used in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia, and to prevent cardiovascular diseases.",

Reactive oxygen species production was assessed with dichlorofluorescein. Migration was studied with a razor scrape assay and measured after 24 hours. In addition, the ability of various antioxidants, added before initiation of the scrape assay, to restore endothelial cell migration in oxLDL was determined.\nOxLDL and lysoPC, at concentrations that stimulated reactive oxygen species production, also inhibited endothelial cell migration. Other agents that generated superoxide also inhibited endothelial cell migration, but hydrogen peroxide did not. Of a variety of antioxidants assessed for their ability to preserve endothelial cell migration in the presence of oxLDL, only superoxide dismutase and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) oxidase inhibitors (diphenyleneiodonium, quinacrine, hydralazine) preserved endothelial cell migration.\nThese data suggest that oxLDL inhibits endothelial cell migration through a superoxide-dependent mechanism and that reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) oxidase is the cellular source of the superoxide.\nOxLDL inhibits endothelial cell migration, and may impair healing of arterial injuries. The mechanism of oxidized LDL inhibition is not known. Our in vitro studies show that the inhibitory properties are related to production of reactive oxygen species. Superoxide dismutase or inhibitors of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase can preserve endothelial migration in the presence of oxLDL. This might improve the healing of endothelial injuries at sites of arterial repair or angioplasty, especially in lipid-laden arterial walls.",

    "abstract": "In response to injury, aging mediates exaggerated neointimal formation, the pathologic hallmark of obliterative vascular diseases. We assessed the development of neointima in a model of mechanical vascular injury in aging mice (18 months old) and young mice (2 months old). To investigate the mechanisms by which aging affects neointimal formation, we also carried out a set of in vitro studies to characterize the biologic properties of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) derived from aging and young mice.\nAging and young mice were subjected to wire injury to the carotid artery. Four weeks later injured arteries were harvested, and neointimal formation was histologically assessed. The profiles of angiogenesis-related genes between aortic VSMCs derived from aging and young mice were compared with complementary DNA arrays. Expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFR-alpha) and proliferation in response to platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) by VSMCs were assessed. Susceptibility to apoptosis in aging and young VSMCs in response to nitric oxide and serum starvation was investigated. In addition, the level of apoptosis in neointimal VSMCs (by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling assay) was compared between aging and young animals.\nWhen compared with young mice, aging mice exhibited exaggerated neointimal formation (intima-media ratio, 1.17 +/- 0.57 vs 0.49 +/- 0.16; P < .0001). Aging VSMCs expressed higher levels of PDGFR-alpha (12.0% +/- 2.7% vs 3.2 +/- 0.67%; P = .034) and greater proliferative response (4-fold increase) to PDGF-BB, compared with young VSMCs. However, aging VSMCs were less susceptible to apoptosis when subjected to serum starvation (75% less) and exposure to nitric oxide (50% less). Furthermore, there was more apoptosis in the neointima of young arteries than in their aging counterparts (8.75% +/- 3.3% vs 2.8% +/- 1.9; P = .021).\nAge-dependent increases in PDGFR-alpha may alter VSMC proliferation, and when coupled with resistance to apoptosis could contribute to exaggerated neointima formation in aging animals. Of significance, our findings in the mouse will enable application of abundant molecular tools afforded by this species to further dissect the mechanisms of exaggerated neointimal formation associated with aging.\nNeointimal formation is the pathologic hallmark of obliterative vascular diseases, including primary atherosclerosis, post stent restenosis, graft occlusion after vascular bypass procedures, and transplant allograft vasculopathy. Aging is an independent risk factor for development of cardiovascular diseases, and aging exaggerates neointimal formation after vascular injury. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon may facilitate prevention or provide new therapies for vascular occlusive diseases, which are so prevalent in the aging population. Our ability to reproduce the model in the mouse will no doubt facilitate such understanding.",

    "abstract": "Recanalization is an important physiologic phenomenon because it can efficiently reestablish circulation after thrombosis. We attempted to characterize molecular events related to recanalization or organization of arterial thrombus in a new murine model by studying genes reported to be involved in angiogenesis or neointima formation.\nPlatinum coils, radioactive phosphorus 32 coils or not, were implanted in the carotid artery in mice to cause thrombotic occlusion. The outcome of the occlusion was followed up with transmyocardial angiography and pathologic analysis at 2, 6, or 15 days. Angiographic results were compared with the Pearson chi2 test. Messenger RNA expression of von Willebrand factor (vWF); smooth muscle alpha-actin (SMA+); platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1); vascular endothelium cadherin (VE-Cad); endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS); vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1); tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha); matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9, MMP-12, and MMP-14), and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs: TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, TIMP-4); angiopoietins (Ang-1, Ang-2); and receptors Tie-1 and Tie-2, were analyzed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 2, 6, and 15 days after surgery. Levels of mRNA expression were compared with analysis of variance and the Student t test.\nCarotid arteries implanted with nonradioactive 0.015-caliber coils were occluded in 84% of arteries on day 2, but in only 57% of arteries on day 15, which confirms that recanalization occurred in this model. Arteries implanted with 0.015-caliber 32P coils did not become recanalized, and 100% were occluded on day 15 (n = 13; P = .006). Recanalization was associated with endothelial-like cell-lined channels, whereas persistent occlusion was caused by complete filling of the lumen with conjunctive tissue. Coil occlusion, with or without recanalization, was followed by decreased expression of vWf, VE-Cad, eNOS, VCAM-1, MMP-2, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2; stable expression of PECAM-1, SMA+, and TIMP-3; and overexpression of Ang-1 and Ang-2, MMP-9, MMP-14, and TIMP-4. Statistically significant differences when arteries were implanted with 32P coils included decreased expression of TIMP-4 (P = .011) and increased expression of MMP-9 (P = .02).\nRecanalization and organization of arterial thrombus is associated with expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and neointima formation. Recanalization can be prevented with beta-radiation, but molecular mechanisms remain to be refined.\nA better understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in angiogenesis has permitted its regulation as a new option in treatment of various diseases. Inhibition of angiogenesis may help control diseases such as cancer, arthritis, or diabetes retinopathy. On the other hand, stimulation of angiogenesis may palliate conditions associated with insufficient blood supply, such as ischemic heart disease or critical limb ischemia. Yet little is known regarding recanalization (to be differentiated from thrombolysis), a cellular process that occurs concurrently with thrombus \"organization.\" Recanalization is an important physiologic phenomenon because it can efficiently reestablish antegrade circulation after thrombosis both in veins and in arteries, and could be modulated for therapeutic purposes. Thus our efforts at better understanding of mechanisms involved in recanalization could be used, in addition to its promotion to recover flow after thrombotic occlusions, to prevent its occurrence after endovascular interventions designed to permanently occlude aneurysms.",

Blood tests were carried out for prothrombotic screening. Venous disease was related to pathologic severity of post-thrombotic syndrome, characterized by the CEAP (clinical, etiologic, anatomic, pathophysiologic) classification on a scale of 0 to 6.\nIn the 102 limbs studied, 30 patients (59%) had an underlying thrombophilic disorder.

    "abstract": "Coursing the posterior thigh as a tributary or trunk projection of the small saphenous vein (SSV), the Giacomini vein's clinical significance in chronic venous disease (CVD) remains undetermined. This cross-sectional controlled study examined the prevalence, anatomy, competency status, and clinical significance of the Giacomini vein across the clinical spectrum of CVD in relation to the SSV termination.\nOne hundred eighty-nine consecutive subjects (301 limbs) with suspected CVD (109 men, 80 women; age, 18-87 years [median, 61 years]) underwent examination, clinical class (CEAP) stratification, and duplex ultrasound determination of the sites and extent of reflux >0.5 sec) and Giacomini vein's anatomy.\nA Giacomini vein was found in 70.4% of limbs (212 of 301; 95% confidence interval, 65%-75.6%). Extent, pattern, and sites of reflux in all named superficial and deep veins were evenly distributed in limbs with and without a Giacomini vein; perforator vein incompetence in thigh and calf was also balanced (all, P > .2). Giacomini vein had no effect ( P > .2) on SSV termination anatomy, displaying a similar prevalence in classes C(0-6) . In 212 limbs, either as a tributary or trunk projection of the SSV, the Giacomini vein ascended subfascially (n = 210) to the lower (8%; n = 17), middle (47.6%; n = 101), or upper (44.3%; n = 94) thigh, and terminated at the deep system (45.3%; n = 96) and/or perforated the fascia (64.2%; n = 136), to join the superficial system. Giacomini vein morphology was not affected by the SSV termination anatomy and CEAP clinical class. Incompetence was detected less often (P < .001) in the Giacomini vein (4.7%; n = 10 of 212) than in the saphenous trunks cumulatively (53.3%; n = 113 of 212). Yet the odds ratio of Giacomini incompetence was 11.94 (7 of 33 over 3 of 169) in the presence of SSV reflux, and 11.67 (6 of 23 over 4 of 179) when both the great saphenous vein (proximal, proximal plus distal) and SSV were incompetent.\nFound in more than two thirds of limbs, the Giacomini vein has a complex anatomy that is linked vastly to the deep or superficial veins of the posteromedial thigh, but is unaffected by the anatomy of SSV termination and CEAP clinical class. Its presence proved insignificant to the extent, pattern, sites, and clinical severity of venous incompetence, yet the Giacomini vein was far less often susceptible to reflux than the saphenous trunks were. Routine Giacomini vein investigation is not justified in view of these findings. Investigation could be considered selectively in limbs with SSV incompetence, with or without great saphenous vein incompetence, supported by the high odds of concomitant Giacomini vein reflux.",

Investigation could be considered selectively in limbs with SSV incompetence, with or without great saphenous vein incompetence, supported by the high odds of concomitant Giacomini vein reflux.",

Extent, pattern, and sites of reflux in all named superficial and deep veins were evenly distributed in limbs with and without a Giacomini vein; perforator vein incompetence in thigh and calf was also balanced (all, P > .2). Giacomini vein had no effect ( P > .2) on SSV termination anatomy, displaying a similar prevalence in classes C(0-6) . In 212 limbs, either as a tributary or trunk projection of the SSV, the Giacomini vein ascended subfascially (n = 210) to the lower (8%; n = 17), middle (47.6%; n = 101), or upper (44.3%; n = 94) thigh, and terminated at the deep system (45.3%; n = 96) and/or perforated the fascia (64.2%; n = 136), to join the superficial system. Giacomini vein morphology was not affected by the SSV termination anatomy and CEAP clinical class. Incompetence was detected less often (P < .001) in the Giacomini vein (4.7%; n = 10 of 212) than in the saphenous trunks cumulatively (53.3%; n = 113 of 212). Yet the odds ratio of Giacomini incompetence was 11.94 (7 of 33 over 3 of 169) in the presence of SSV reflux, and 11.67 (6 of 23 over 4 of 179) when both the great saphenous vein (proximal, proximal plus distal) and SSV were incompetent.",

    "abstract": "As an emerging endovascular alternative to ligation and stripping of the incompetent greater saphenous vein (GSV), radiofrequency ablation was monitored with ultrasound scanning to evaluate anatomic results. Neovascularization and inflammation are potential consequences that lead to the appearance of small vessels. The natural history of the below-knee untreated GSV segment may be important in our understanding of ongoing chronic venous disease. An ultrasound follow-up study was conducted to determine the prevalence of small vessel networks, defined as veins and arteries less than 2 mm in diameter, adjacent to the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ); prevalence of small vessel networks adjacent to the treated GSV in the thigh; and fate of the below-knee untreated GSV distal to the ablated segment.\nOne hundred six extremities with radiofrequency ablation of the GSV for treatment of superficial venous insufficiency were followed up with high-resolution ultrasound imaging 4 to 25 months (median, 9 months) after the procedure. Ninety-three limbs had concomitant ligation and division of the SFJ and its tributaries, and 13 limbs underwent radiofrequency ablation without SFJ ligation. Ultrasound was used to evaluate patients for small vessel networks, and concomitant findings of small vessel networks and recanalization at the SFJ and adjacent to the treated GSV. The status of the below-knee segment of untreated GSV was evaluated for patency and reflux. Data analysis compared the findings in the ligation group with those in the no-ligation group, with the chi 2 test and Fisher exact test.\nWe found small vessel networks in 65% (n = 69) of extremities: 15% (n = 16) at the SFJ only, 26% (n = 28) in the thigh only, and 24% (n = 25) at both the SFJ and thigh, resulting in a small vessel network prevalence of 39% (n = 41) at the SJF and 50% (n = 53) in the thigh. The prevalence of small vessel networks at the SFJ was significantly less after radiofrequency ablation with SFJ ligation (34%, 32 of 93) than after radiofrequency ablation without ligation (69%, 9 of 13; P = .035). Small vessel networks and GSV recanalization at the SFJ was more common in patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation without ligation (46%, 6 of 13) than after radiofrequency ablation with ligation (14%, 13 of 93; P = .014). The prevalence of small vessel networks in the thigh was not affected by SFJ ligation. The below-knee GSV was patent in 79% (84 of 106), and 58% (61 of 106) demonstrated reflux, a decrease from the pre-radiofrequency ablation rate of 71% (75 of 106), possibly because thrombosis extended distally beyond the ablated segment in 16% (17 of 106) of the legs.\nSmall vessel networks were detected adjacent to or in connection with most of the radiofrequency ablation-treated GSVs. SFJ ligation was associated with fewer small vessel networks and proximal GSV recanalization. Most below-knee untreated GSV segments remained patent, and most exhibited reflux.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have been published regarding the influence of smoking on the incidence and prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). A systematic review was performed to establish the magnitude of the effect of smoking on the development of PAD, and a possible dose-response relationship.\nEnglish-language articles were reviewed by 2 observers using a standardized form, and were summarized in tabular form. Data were extracted by 2 independent observers. Where possible, outcome data, expressed in terms of prevalence or incidence, were recalculated as odds ratio or relative risk, with never-smokers as the reference group, or if this was not available the nonsmoker group. Most studies did not provide primary data. Therefore the weighted means were reported as a summary estimate, provided that a funnel plot between sample size and observed effect size made publication bias unlikely.\nSixteen articles describing 17 studies were included in the analysis. Four of the studies were prospective, and 13 were cross-sectional. The prevalence of symptomatic PAD was increased 2.3-fold in current smokers. Even in former smokers the prevalence was substantially increased by a factor of 2.6. A clear dose-response relationship, with a strong increase in risk for PAD in heavy smokers was observed. In countries where approximately 30% of the population are smokers, 50% of PAD can be attributed to smoking.\nSmoking is a potent risk factor for symptomatic PAD, with an important and consistent dose-response relationship. With the persistence of high risk for PAD in former smokers, tobacco control programs should continue to advocate smoking cessation, but focus even more on preventing future generations from ever starting to smoke.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to evaluate our experience with distal arterial bypass to the plantar artery branches and the lateral tarsal artery for ischemic limb salvage.\nThis was a retrospective analysis of data prospectively entered into our vascular surgery database from January 1990 to January 2003 for all consecutive patients undergoing bypass grafting to the plantar artery branches or the lateral tarsal artery. Median follow-up was 9 months (range, 1-112 months). Demographic data, indications for surgery, outcomes, and patency were recorded, and statistical analysis was performed to assess significance.\nNinety-eight bypass procedures to either the medial plantar artery, lateral plantar artery, or lateral tarsal artery were performed in 90 patients. Eighty-one patients (83%) were men. Mean age was 67.5 +/- 11.6 years. Indications for operation were tissue loss in 93 patients (95%), rest pain in 3 patients (3%), and failing graft in 2 patients (2%). Eighteen patients (18%) had previously undergone vascular reconstruction, and 5 patients (5%) had undergone previous bypass to the dorsalis pedis artery. Seventy-one grafts (72%) had inflow from the popliteal artery, 25 grafts had inflow from a femoral artery or graft (26%), and 2 grafts had inflow from a tibial artery (2%). Conduits used were greater saphenous vein in 67 patients (69%), arm vein in 20 patients (20%), composite vein in 10 patients (10%), and polytetrafluoroethylene conduit in 1 patient (1%). There were 77 bypasses (79%) to plantar artery branches, and 21 bypasses (21%) to the lateral tarsal artery. Thirty-day mortality was 1% (1 of 98 procedures). Early graft failure within 30 days occurred in 11 patients (11%). In the subset of patients with a previous arterial reconstruction, there were 2 early graft failures within 30 days (11%). Both occurred in patients who had undergone previous bypass to the dorsalis pedis artery. Primary patency, secondary patency, limb salvage, and patient survival were 67%, 70%, 75%, and 91%, respectively, at 12 months, and 41%, 50%, 69%, and 63%, respectively, at 5 years, as determined from Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Greater saphenous vein grafts performed better than all other conduits, with a secondary patency rate of 82% versus 47% at 1 year (P = .009).\nInframalleolar bypass to plantar artery branches and the lateral tarsal artery, even in patients with a previously failed revascularization, can be undertaken with acceptable patency and limb salvage rates. Early graft failure, however, is higher, whereas patency and limb salvage rates are lower, compared with bypass to the dorsalis pedis artery. The use of saphenous vein as a conduit results in the best patency for plantar or lateral tarsal bypass procedures.",

    "abstract": "To prospectively evaluate complications after diagnostic and therapeutic endovascular procedures (DTEPs) and determine what factors are predictive.\nFrom December 2002 to December 2003, all patients undergoing DTEPs performed by university vascular surgeons in a catheterization laboratory were prospectively evaluated. Medical demographics, procedure-related details, and type and severity of complications were recorded at the time of the procedure, during the first 24 hours, and at 2 to 4 weeks. Complications were classified as local vascular (LV), local nonvascular (LNV), systemic remote (SR), and major, minor, and nonsignificant.\nThree hundred-three DTEPs were performed (54.5% DEPs, 45.5% TEPs). At the time of DTEP, 28 complications occurred in 23 patients: 10 LV (3.3%), 15 LNV (5.0%), and 3 SR (1.0%). At 24 hours, 26 complications occurred in 25 patients: 5 LV (1.7%), 7 LNV (2.3%), and 14 SR (4.7%). At 2 to 4 weeks, 26 complications occurred 25 patients: 5 LV (1.7%), 7 LNV (2.3%), and 14 SR (4.7%). The combined major (7.3%) and minor (4.3%) complication rate attributed to DTEPs was 11.6%. Significant predictors (P < .05) by multivariate analysis included thrombolysis, prior stroke, an additional procedure during the study period, and diabetes mellitus (odds ratios: 9.1, 3.2, 2.7, and 2.4, respectively).\nAccording to newly applied reporting standards, the prospective evaluation of DTEPs reveals that complications are uniformly distributed by type and follow-up period. Just over 1 in 10 patients will suffer either a major or minor complication. Potential predictors have been identified that may assist in patient selection and treatment plans to lower complications resulting from DTEPs.",

    "abstract": "Apart from proper hydration, only oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has shown efficacy in reducing radiographic contrast media (RCM)-induced acute renal failure, though its benefit has been challenged. We investigated the effect of intravenous (i.v.) NAC on renal function in patients with vascular disease receiving RCM for angiography.\nSingle-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Based on a previous study, a trial with 44 patients each in placebo and treatment arms would give at least 80% power to show a statistically significant difference at the 5% level. Vascular patients undergoing angiography were consented and segregated into those whose serum creatinine (SC) level was normal or raised (men >1.32 mg/dl; women >1.07 mg/dL). All patients received 500 mL i.v. normal saline 6 to 12 hours prior to and then after angiography. Groups with normal SC and raised SC were randomly assigned to either 1 g of NAC with normal saline before and after angiography or nothing (placebo). Main outcome measures were change in SC and creatinine clearance (CrCl) as measured 1, 2, and 7 days postangiography (with comparison between active and placebo groups using unpaired t test) and incidence of acute renal decline (>25% or 0.5 mg/dL rise in SC) at 48 hours (with comparison between active and placebo using the Fisher exact test).\nForty-six patients received NAC (29 normal SC, 17 raised SC), and 48 received placebo (27 normal SC, 21 raised SC). There was no significant difference in postangiography SC or CrCl at any of the time points measured between NAC and placebo in patients with either normal or raised SC. In the raised SC group, 3 patients from both the NAC and placebo groups suffered acute renal declines. Importantly, at 48 hours, the impaired SC group had a significant reduction in CrCl (-14% +/- 41% vs +18% +/- 58%: P = .0142) and a significant rise in SC (+7.0 +/- 25% vs -1.6% +/- 10%; P = .0246) when compared with the normal SC group.\nNAC (i.v. at 1 g) precontrast and postcontrast does not confer any benefit in preventing RCM-induced nephropathy in vascular patients. Patients with pre-existing raised SC have an increased risk of renal impairment as defined by a fall in CrCl and a rise in SC post-RCM when compared with patients with normal SC who appear to benefit from hydration.",

We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials to assess the effect of routine or selective carotid patch angioplasty compared with CEA with primary closure, and the effect of different materials used for carotid patch angioplasty.\nRandomized trials were included if they compared carotid patch angioplasty with primary closure in any patients undergoing CEA or use of one type of carotid patch with another.\nThirteen eligible randomized trials were identified. Seven trials involving 1281 operations compared primary closure with routine patch closure, and 8 trials with 1480 operations compared different patch materials (2 studies compared both). Patch angioplasty was associated with a reduction in risk for stroke of any type (P = .004), ipsilateral stroke (P = .001), and stroke or death during both the perioperative period (P = .007) and long-term follow-up (P = .004). Patching was also associated with reduced risk for perioperative arterial occlusion (P = .0001) and decreased recurrent stenosis during long-term follow-up (P < .0001). Seven trials that compared different patch types showed no difference in the risk for stroke, death, or arterial recurrent stenosis either perioperatively or at 1-year follow-up. One study of 180 patients (200 arteries) compared collagen-impregnated Dacron (Hemashield) patches with polytetrafluoroethylene patches. There was a significant increase in risk for stroke (P = .02), combined stroke and transient ischemic attack (P = .03), and recurrent stenosis (P = .01) at 30 days, and an increased risk for late recurrent stenosis greater than 50% (P < .001) associated with Dacron compared with polytetrafluoroethylene.\nCarotid patch angioplasty decreases the risk for perioperative death or stroke, and long-term risk for ipsilateral ischemic stroke.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether performance on a simulator model of carotid artery stenting correlates with previous endovascular experience and to assess the effects of repetition and training.\nParticipants were stratified to untrained and advanced skill groups on the basis of number of endovascular procedures previously performed. Baseline performance was assessed by means of a pretest, and participants were randomized to practice and no-practice groups. Practice consisted of a 30-minute to 60-minute proctored session before taking a final test; those in the no-practice group proceeded directly to the final test without this session. Primary outcomes were completion of a standardized protocol and the length of time needed to complete all steps.\nTwenty-nine subjects (16 untrained, 13 advanced) participated fully in the study. Ninety-two percent of participants in the advanced group successfully completed the pretest, versus 63% in the untrained group (P = .09); mean time to successful completion was 29.9 +/- 4.8 (mean +/- SD) versus 48.0 +/- 9.9 minutes, respectively (P < .001). Subjects who received no practice did not significantly improve their completion times between pretest and final test, whereas those who received practice did (novice, 47.9 +/- 7.0 minutes vs 24.5 +/- 2.9 minutes, P < .001; advanced, 29.6 +/- 3.1 minutes vs 20.2 +/- 4.1 minutes, P < .001). The group without previous training had significantly more time improvement from training than did the advanced group. Exit survey results showed that those who had the opportunity to practice more commonly believed that the simulator increased their endovascular skills and interest in vascular surgery (both P < .01 vs untrained group).\nPerformance on the carotid stenting simulator correlated with previous endovascular experience. Although both novice and advanced groups improved their time after a 30-minute to 60-minute proctored training session, improvement in the novice group was greater than that in the advanced group, which suggests that novices may benefit disproportionately from this type of training.",

    "abstract": "Computer simulation has been used in a variety of training programs, ranging from airline piloting to general surgery. In this study we evaluate the use of simulation to train novice and advanced interventionalists in catheter-based techniques.\nTwenty-one physicians underwent evaluation in a simulator training program that involved placement of a carotid stent. Five participants were highly experienced in catheter-based techniques (>300 percutaneous cases), including carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS); the remaining 16 participants were interventional novices (<5 percutaneous cases). The Procedicus VIST simulator, composed of real-time vascular imaging simulation software and a tactile interface coupled to angiographic catheters and guide wires, was used. After didactic instruction regarding CAS and use of the simulator, each participant performed a simulated CAS procedure. The participant's performance was supervised and evaluated by an expert interventionalist on the basis of 50 specific procedural steps with a maximal score of 100. Specific techniques of guide wire and catheter manipulation were subjectively assessed on a scale of 0 to 5 points based on ability. After evaluation of the initial simulated CAS procedure, each participant received a minimum of 2 hours of individualized training by the expert interventionalist, with the VIST simulator. Each participant then performed a second simulated CAS procedure, which was graded with the same scale. After completion, participants assessed the training program and its utility via survey questionnaire.\nThe average simulated score for novice participants after the training program improved significantly from 17.8 +/- 15.6 to 69.8 +/- 9.8 (P < .01), time to complete simulation decreased from 44 +/- 10 minutes to 30 +/- 8 minutes (P < .01), and fluoroscopy time decreased from 31 +/- 7 minutes to 23 +/- 7 minutes ( P < .01). No statistically significant difference in score, total time, or fluoroscopy time was noted for experienced interventionalists. Improvement was noted in guide wire and catheter manipulation skills in novices. Analysis of survey data from experienced interventionalists indicated that the simulated clinical scenarios were realistic and that the simulator could be a valuable tool if clinical and tactile feedback were improved. Novices also thought the simulated training was a valuable experience, and desired further training time.\nAn endovascular training program using the Procedicus VIST haptic simulator resulted in significant improvement in trainee facility with catheter-based techniques in a simulated clinical setting. Novice participants derived the greatest benefit from simulator training in a mentored program, whereas experienced interventionalists did not seem to derive significant benefit.",

    "abstract": "A heightened risk of stroke and death among octogenarians undergoing carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been reported. The multicenter Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs. Stent Trial (CREST) supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders, National Institutes of Health, compares the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and CAS in an ongoing clinical trial. This effort also includes a \"lead-in\" phase of symptomatic (>50% stenosis) and asymptomatic (>70% stenosis) patients. The protocol calls for patients to receive aspirin and clopidogrel before and 30-days after CAS and to be examined by a study neurologist preprocedure, at 24-hours, and at 30-day. The occurrence of stroke and death was reviewed by an independent clinical events committee.\nThe association of age and periprocedural stroke and death was examined in 749 lead-in patients undergoing CAS (30.7% symptomatic, 69.3% asymptomatic). Patients were separated into four age categories: less than 60, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80 years or older, and the proportion of patients with stroke and death during the 30-day periprocedural period was calculated for each category.\nAn increasing proportion of patients suffered stroke and death with increasing age (P = .0006); 2 (1.7%) of 120 patients under age 60, 3 (1.3%) of 229 aged 60 to 69, 16 (5.3%) of 301 aged 70 to 79, and 12 (12.1%) of 99 patients aged 80 years and older. These increasingly high complication rates at older ages were not mediated by adjustment for symptomatic status, use of antiembolic devices, gender, percentage of carotid stenosis, or the presence of distal arterial tortuosity.\nInterim results from the lead-in phase of CREST show that the periprocedural risk of stroke and death after CAS increases with age in the course of a credentialing registry. This effect is not mediated by potential confounding factors. Randomized trial data are needed to compare the CAS versus CEA periprocedural risk of stroke and death by age. Pending results from randomized studies, care should be taken when CAS is performed in older patient populations.",

    "abstract": "Blunt traumatic thoracic aortic disruption results in pre-hospital death in 80% to 90% of patients. Because of the significant surgical morbidity and mortality associated with open operative repair, endovascular stent-graft repair has been investigated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of thoracic aortic disruptions treated with commercially available proximal aortic extension cuffs.\nNine patients with multiple system trauma (age range, 16-42 years) were seen after motor vehicle accidents between January 1, 2003, and April 1, 2004. Chest x-ray findings warranted thoracic computed tomography scans, which revealed disruptions of the thoracic aorta. Aortograms delineated the extent of the aortic injuries and identified a \"landing zone\" (neck length range, 1.5-2.0 cm) distal to the subclavian artery but proximal to the tear. The repairs were performed with AneuRx (n= 8) and Excluder (n = 1) proximal aortic extension cuffs. A left femoral artery approach was used in 6 patients, a suprainguinal retroperitoneal approach with an iliac conduit in 2 patients, and direct tunnel in 1 patient. An Amplatz super-stiff wire was placed in the right axillary artery to enable easy tracking of the endografts, and left brachial artery access was used for arch arteriography.\nIn each patient the stent-graft cuff was deployed adjacent to the left subclavian artery, with successful exclusion of traumatic disruptions verified at intraoperative arteriography and on computed tomographic scans obtained within 48 hours of initial repair. One patient required a second cuff for exclusion of a type I endoleak at the distal attachment site 1 month after the initial endograft repair. There were no procedure-related deaths; 1 patient, however, died of other injuries.\nStent-graft repair of traumatic thoracic aortic disruptions is technically feasible. Placement of a stiff wire in the right axillary artery and percutaneous left brachial artery access for arteriography are useful adjuncts during endograft deployment. Endovascular stent grafts may enable definitive repair or serve as a bridge until the patient is stable enough to undergo an operation, if necessary. This technique warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "We report 5 patients in whom a symptomatic perigraft seroma developed within the aortic sac, without vascular endoleak, after open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft. We also discuss possible relationships of this phenomenon to endovascular repair of AAAs.\nOver 18 years, 1156 patients underwent repair of an AAA by one of the authors (B.M.B.). Of these, 1084 underwent open repair, 256 with PTFE grafts. Five patients in the PTFE group (2.3%) returned at a mean of 4.5 years with acute abdominal or back pain and enlargement of the aortic sac. Mean diameter of the aneurysms was 5.9 cm preoperatively and 8.1 cm at readmission. There was no evidence of vascular endoleak on computed tomography scans, but 1 patient had a retroperitoneal hematoma.\nLaparotomy in 4 patients disclosed a seroma containing firm rubbery gelatinous material under tension, histologically identified as amorphous eosinophilic material containing thrombus and degenerate blood cells in all cases. Rupture of the sac was confirmed in the patient with a retroperitoneal hematoma. The sac contents were evacuated and the integrity of the underlying grafts and anastomoses was confirmed before sac reduction, with imbricating sutures, and closure was performed. One patient died at 8 months of an unrelated cause; the other 3 patients remain well at mean follow-up of 12 months. The fifth patient received conservative treatment and remains asymptomatic 3 years after acute presentation.\nThese findings of sac enlargement without vascular endoleak after open AAA repair are reminiscent of sac enlargement in the absence of endoleak after endovascular AAA repair. This has been referred to as endotension. The comparatively benign outcome in 5 patients with symptomatic sac enlargement, including 2 patients with rupture, after open AAA repair provides data to support a circumspect approach to endotension, especially in patients with asymptomatic disease, which has been reported as occurring in almost half of patients who received a PTFE Excluder endograft.",

    "abstract": "Protruding aortic arch thrombus is associated clinically with life-threatening emboli. Definitive treatment for aortic arch thrombus removal has demanded complicated vascular surgical procedures, with high morbidity and mortality.\nTransesophageal echocardiography (TEE) enabled diagnosis of a protruding thrombus at the aortic arch in 5 patients, and a simultaneous lesion in the descending aorta in 1 patient. Four patients had visceral emboli, coinciding with peripheral emboli in 2 patients, and the fifth patient had peripheral and cerebral emboli. One patient had had ischemic stroke and femoral emboli a few months previously. Mean patient age was 51 years. None had clinical evidence of coronary or peripheral atherosclerotic occlusive disease. Risk factors included hypertension (n = 2), smoking (n = 4), and preexisting thrombophilia (n = 4). Five patients underwent TEE-guided aortic balloon thrombectomy from the arch with a 34-mm occluding balloon catheter. One patient also underwent balloon thrombectomy from the descending aorta with a 14F Foley catheter. Access into the aorta was obtained through the iliac artery (n = 4) during laparotomy because of visceral ischemia or through the transfemoral approach (n = 2). Previous procedures included superior mesenteric embolectomy (n = 3), segmental bowel resection (n = 1), splenectomy (n = 1), and peripheral arterial embolectomy n = 3). Real-time intraoperative TEE enabled visualization of the protruding thrombus and assisted with maneuvering of the balloon catheter. At completion peripheral thrombectomy thrombus material was retrieved in 4 patients. Postoperatively there were no clinically proved new procedure-related visceral emboli, and all patients received anticoagulant therapy thereafter. Follow-up TEE within 2 weeks and up to 7 years revealed no recurrent aortic arch thrombus.\nTEE-guided aortic balloon thrombectomy used in 6 procedures was effectively completed without visceral or peripheral ischemic complications. It enabled removal of the life-threatening source of emboli from the proximal aorta, thereby averting the need of major aortic surgery.",

Patients were divided into 2 groups, those with complicated aortic necks (short, <15 mm; very short, < or =10 mm; dilated, >28 mm; angulated, >45 degrees; calcified; and thrombus-lined) versus those with uncomplicated neck anatomy. Major outcome parameters included procedure time, operative blood loss, transfusion requirements, volume of contrast medium used during the implant procedure, endoleaks, migration, limb patency, AAA regression, conversion to open repair, morbidity, and mortality. Mean follow-up was 620.5 days.\nOverall, 32% of aortic necks were short, 19% were very short, 20% were dilated, 18% were calcified, 8.5% were thrombus-lined, and 19.9% were angulated. Thirty percent and 70% of patients, respectively, were stratified to the uncomplicated and complicated groups ( P < .01. Procedure time, operative blood loss, transfusions, volume of contrast medium used in the implant procedure, migration, endograft patency, AAA sac regression, conversion to open repair, and mortality were not significantly different in necks with complicated versus uncomplicated anatomy. At 21 months, sacs were regressing or stable in 98% (complicated) versus 96% (uncomplicated). Primary graft limb patency was 100% in both groups. The endoleak rate was 4.3% (complicated) versus 17% (uncomplicated) at 18 months, but this difference was not statistically significant. Adverse renal events, however, occurred in 27.5% (complicated) versus 13.6% (uncomplicated; P = .04).\nComplicated aortic neck is not associated with unfavorable outcome at midterm follow-up after AAA endografting. However, statistically more adverse renal events occur in patients with complicated neck anatomy.",

Thirty percent and 70% of patients, respectively, were stratified to the uncomplicated and complicated groups ( P < .01. Procedure time, operative blood loss, transfusions, volume of contrast medium used in the implant procedure, migration, endograft patency, AAA sac regression, conversion to open repair, and mortality were not significantly different in necks with complicated versus uncomplicated anatomy. At 21 months, sacs were regressing or stable in 98% (complicated) versus 96% (uncomplicated). Primary graft limb patency was 100% in both groups. The endoleak rate was 4.3% (complicated) versus 17% (uncomplicated) at 18 months, but this difference was not statistically significant. Adverse renal events, however, occurred in 27.5% (complicated) versus 13.6% (uncomplicated; P = .04).",

    "abstract": "Renal failure is a potential complication after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair and is a significant risk factor for postoperative mortality. We assessed the results of distal aortic perfusion and continuous volume-controlled and pressure-controlled blood perfusion of the kidneys during TAAA repair in patients with preoperative normal and impaired renal function.\nSurgical repair of TAAA was performed in 279 consecutive patients (type I, n = 90; type II, 117; type III, 42; type IV, 30). In 195 patients preoperative renal function was normal; however, in 84 patients renal insufficiency was diagnosed (serum creatinine concentration [SCr], 1.4-2.0 mg/dL, n = 46; SCr, 2.0-2.5 mg/dL, n = 20; and SCr, >2.5 mg/dL, n = 18). Renal perfusion was established with catheters connected to the left-sided heart bypass. Volume flow was assessed with ultrasound, and pressure channels in the catheters enabled pressure- controlled perfusion of the kidneys.\nSelective renal artery perfusion was achieved in all patients without technical problems or complications. In each catheter, mean arterial pressure was 69 mm Hg and volume flow was 275 mL/min. During aortic cross-clamping, urine output was uninterrupted, irrespective of clamp time. Most patients demonstrated limited or moderate increase in SCr concentration. In 17 patients (6%) SCr doubled, and peaked above 3 mg/dL, but returned to baseline levels within several days. Three patients (1%) required temporary dialysis but were discharged without further need for dialysis. In general, preoperative renal impairment did not worsen.\nDistal aortic and selective renal blood perfusion is an effective measure to protect renal function during TAAA repair, but only if perfusion is provided with adequate volume and pressure. This technique also averts dialysis in most patients with preoperative renal failure.",
