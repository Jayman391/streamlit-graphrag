    "abstract": "Endothelial cells (EC) secrete vasoactive eicosanoids, which maintain organ blood flow. Because EC are a major source of eicosanoids, we studied the effects of reoxygenation on EC prostacyclin production.\nBovine aortic EC cultures were exposed to 2 hours of normoxia, then 1 hour of hypoxia (PO2 = 10 +/- 3.5 mm Hg), followed by 1.5 hours of reoxygenation in either normal medium or medium plus either superoxide dismutase (SOD, 300 units/ml), catalase (1200 units/ml), allopurinol (5.0 x 10(-4) mol/L), or dinitrophenol (10(-4) mol/L).\nProstacyclin production decreased to 40% (p < 0.05) of basal prostacyclin production after 1 hour of hypoxia. EC reoxygenated with control medium recovered to 48% of basal prostacyclin production. EC reoxygenated in SOD resulted in recovery (p < 0.05) to 154% of basal prostacyclin production after 60 minutes. Catalase treatment resulted in recovery to 105% (p < 0.05) of basal prostacyclin production within 30 minutes of reoxygenation. Allopurinol treatment resulted in 77% recovery (p < 0.05) of basal prostacyclin production only during 30 minutes of reoxygenation. Dinitrophenol treatment resulted in significant (> or = 85%, p < 0.05) sustained recovery of basal prostacyclin production at 30, 60, and 90 minutes of experimental reperfusion.\nThe hypoxia-induced decrease in EC prostacyclin does not recover during reoxygenation. Catalase/SOD allowed return to baseline prostacyclin production during reoxygenation, implicating reactive oxygen metabolites as mediators of decreased eicosanoid biosynthesis. Recovery of prostacyclin production after 60 minutes reoxygenation with dinitrophenol but not allopurinol suggests a mitochondrial origin of the oxygen metabolites responsible for decreased prostacyclin biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "B-mode imaging of a normal arterial wall shows two echo-dense lines separated by an echolucent zone. Immediately after carotid endarterectomy, this double-line pattern is no longer detectable, but it subsequently reappears in some patients. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the postoperative double line is associated with a lower incidence of carotid restenosis.\nCarotid arteries were serially studied with B-mode ultrasound imaging at 2 weeks and 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after carotid endarterectomy. The wall of the common carotid artery 1 to 2 cm distal to the proximal endarterectomized shelf was analyzed for the presence, quality, and thickness of double lines. All hemodynamically significant stenoses (> or = 50% diameter reducing) were documented with standard duplex scanning criteria.\nTwenty-four carotid arteries in 23 patients were studied for a mean of 14.7 months (range, 3 to 24 months). A double line developed in 21 common carotid arteries (87.5%) at a mean time of 3.2 months (range, 0.5 to 9.0 months) after surgery with a mean thickness of 0.65 mm (SD = 0.17 mm) at the time of initial detection. A single hemodynamically significant stenosis developed in this group. All three of the remaining arteries that did not form the double-line pattern developed hemodynamically significant stenoses. Carotid restenosis was more likely to occur in arteries that did not form double lines (p < 0.05, Fisher's exact test).\nThe majority of carotid arteries re-form a double line after endarterectomy. These arteries are less likely to develop restenotic lesions caused by myointimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of the long-term clinical outcome of Raynaud's syndrome (RS), essential both for patient counselling and formulation of optimal therapeutic recommendations, is conspicuously deficient in current medical literature. We have prospectively monitored 1039 patients with RS, 118 (11.4%) for more than 10 years to determine whether initial characterization was able to predict outcome.\nAt initial presentation, patients were divided into four groups on the basis of vascular laboratory and serologic testing results: vasospastic, serologically positive (spast,sero+) and negative (spast,sero-) and obstructive, serologically positive (obst,sero+) and negative (obst,sero-).\nConnective tissue disease (CTD) was present initially in 48.6% of patients with spast,sero+ results and 72.9% of patients with obst,sero+ results. Of the remaining patients in these groups, progression to CTD during follow-up occurred in 16.4% of patients with spast,sero+ results and 30.4% of patients with obst,sero+ results. In the > 10-year follow-up group, progression to CTD occurred in 81.8% of patients in the obst,sero+ group. Progression to CTD occurred in 2.0% of patients in the spast,sero-group and 8.5% of patients in the obst,sero- group. Digital ulcers occurred in 15.5% of patients in the spast,sero+ group, 5.2% of patients in the spast,sero- group, 55.6% of patients in the obst,sero+ group, and 48.2% of patients in the obst,sero- group. Digital or phalangeal amputations were required in 1.4%, 1.6%, 11.6%, and 19.0% of these patients, respectively.\nThe long-term outcome of patients with RS can be predicted by initial serologic studies and separation into vasospastic and obstructive categories. Initial serologic positivity strongly predicts the development of CTD. Initial vascular laboratory classification of obstructive RS strongly predicts digital ulcerations, which occurred in half of these patients regardless of initial serologic study results. Amputations were required in 10% to 20% of patients with obstructive RS. These occurrences did not increase with increased duration of disease. Ulcerations and amputations were rare in patients initially with vasospastic RS.",

    "abstract": "Thrombolytic therapy is widely used in the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusion, but prospective, randomized comparisons with standard therapy remain few. A multicenter trial of thrombolysis or peripheral arterial surgery (TOPAS) was organized to compare critically the use of recombinant urokinase (rUK) or surgery for the initial treatment of acute lower-extremity ischemia. Phase I of the trial was designed as a dose-ranging trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three doses of rUK in comparison with surgery.\nIn a multicenter, prospective, double-blind comparison, 213 patients who had acute lower-extremity ischemia for 14 days or fewer were randomized to one of two groups. The first group received one of three dosages of rUK (catheter-directed at 2000, 4000, or 6000 IU/min for 4 hours, then 2000 IU/min to a maximum of 48 hours). The second group underwent surgery. Successful thrombolysis was followed by surgical or endovascular interventions when anatomic lesions responsible for the occlusion were unmasked. Patients were followed-up for 1 year; data were evaluated on an intent-to-treat basis.\nThe 4000 IU/min rUK dosage was chosen as the most appropriate thrombolytic regimen because it maximized lytic efficacy against the risk of bleeding. Complete (> 95%) lysis of thrombus was achieved in 71% of the 49 patients who were randomized to the 4000 IU/min group, with a mean infusion time of 23 hours. In contrast, complete lysis was achieved in 67% of patients who received 2000 IU/min and in 60% of patients who received 6000 IU/min. Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 2% of the 4000 IU/min group versus 13% of the 2000 IU/min group (p = 0.05) and 16% of the 6000 IU/min group (p = 0.03). In a comparison of the 4000 IU/min group with the surgical group, the 1-year mortality rate (14% vs 16%) or amputation-free survival rate (75% vs 65%) did not differ significantly. The frequency and magnitude of surgery in the patients randomized to rUK were decreased (p < 0.001).\nThe preliminary results suggest that an initial rUK dose of 4000 IU/min is safe and efficacious in the treatment of acute lower-extremity ischemia. rUK therapy is associated with limb salvage and patient survival rates similar to those achieved with surgery, concurrent with a reduced requirement for complex surgery after thrombolytic intervention.",

Resistance to APC (APC-R), hypothesized to occur as a result of an abnormal factor V, has been documented in up to 40% of patients with venous thrombotic events, but its prevalence in patients with arterial disease remains ill defined.\nWith an assay of APC resistance that expresses the ratio of the activated partial thromboplastin time with and without the addition of exogenous APC, APC resistance ratios were quantitated in 200 individuals comprising 177 patients with vascular disease and 23 control subjects. An abnormal activated partial thromboplastin time was present in four patients who were excluded from analysis. The 173 remaining patients formed the study population and were divided into diagnostic subgroups on the basis of the most symptomatic problem.\nAPC resistance was documented in 20 individuals, representing 11.6% of the study group. The highest prevalence of APC resistance was observed in patients with lower extremity occlusive disease, with the APC-R ratio below 2.0 in 13.7%. Within the subgroup of individuals with lower extremity disease, 76 patients (10 with APC-R, 13.2%) underwent infrainguinal bypass and were monitored a mean of 47 +/- 8 months. Occlusion of the arterial reconstruction occurred in 22 patients (29%). Six (60%) of the patients with APC-R had failed reconstructions, versus 16 (24%) of 66 patients without APC-R (p = 0.02).\nThese findings suggest that APC-R is relatively common in patients with peripheral vascular disease, especially in those with lower extremity occlusive disease. APC-R appears to be a risk factor for failure of infrainguinal bypass. These observations suggest that screening for APC-R may be useful in patients with peripheral vascular disease, providing the opportunity to restore the normal thrombogenic balance with anticoagulant therapy in susceptible individuals.",

PAI-1 was associated with a history of heart disease (p < 0.05) and prior vascular procedures (p < 0.05). Elevated Lp(a) was associated with elevated PAI-1 (p < 0.05). Retesting in 20 patients suggested that 80% of NAC deficiencies were acquired, but abnormalities persisted in 66% of patients with elevated PAI-1 and in 93% of those with elevated Lp(a).\nThese data strongly support the hypothesis that the convergence of atherogenic risk factors and hypercoagulability play an important role in early ischemia and poor results reported for lower extremity vascular procedures in young adults.",

    "abstract": "Data from our institution and elsewhere have demonstrated that ultrasound-guided compression closure (UGCC) is an effective method of treating postcatheterization pseudoaneurysms. Whereas patients receiving anticoagulation do not have as high a success rate as those not receiving anticoagulants, there have been no large series evaluating the factors associated with success or failure in patients receiving anticoagulation. The purpose of this study is to determine whether uninterrupted anticoagulation interferes with successful UGCC of pseudoaneurysms and to identify factors associated with success or failure.\nFrom May 1991 to September 1994, 238 cases of attempted UGCC of pseudoaneurysms were performed in our vascular laboratory. Only patients who received uninterrupted heparin, warfarin, or both at the time of pseudoaneurysm compression were eligible for inclusion into the study. Seventy-seven patients were identified who met the study criteria.\nSuccessful pseudoaneurysm compression was obtained in 56 (73%) patients, whereas 21 (27%) patients had a failed UGCC. In the successfully treated group, seven (12.5%) required between two to three compression attempts to induce sustained thrombosis. There was no statistical difference in age, sex, sheath size, days after procedure, location of pseudoaneurysm, or number of chambers in the pseudoaneurysm between those patients who had a successful repair and those who did not. If the pseudoaneurysm was less than 4 cm in diameter, 51 of 65 patients (78%) had a successful repair compared with 5 of 12 patients (42%) with a pseudoaneurysm of 4 cm or greater (p = 0.013). There was no statistical difference between success and failure in patients receiving warfarin alone (3.73 mean international normalized ratio, 72% success rate), heparin alone (mean activated partial thromboplastin time of 63 seconds, 92% success rate), or heparin and warfarin (mean activated partial thromboplastin time of 70 seconds, mean international normalized ratio of 4, success rate of 67%). No arterial or venous thrombosis occurred during pseudoaneurysm compression.\nSuccessful UGCC of pseudoaneurysms occurred in a large percentage of patients receiving full-dose, uninterrupted anticoagulation. The only factor influencing success was the size of the pseudoaneurysm.",

The distal anastomosis was at the popliteal level in 207 (37%) and the tibial level in 349 (63%). All patients were enrolled in a prospective surveillance protocol to identify lesions that compromise graft patency and were evaluated at 1 day, 1 week, 6 weeks, and 3 months.

The median interval from the initial procedure to detection of an abnormality was 12 months (range 0 to 113 months) and varied with the location of the defect. Later in the life of the graft, progression of atherosclerotic disease manifested as inflow obstruction at a median of 15 months, and outflow disease threatened the graft at a median of 29 months (r = 0.0003). Of the 450 surveillance abnormalities, 294 (65%) occurred within the first 2 years after operation, and 156 (35%) developed more than 2 years after operation.

Eleven percent of grafts remaining free of abnormality after 2 years went on to fail.

    "abstract": "The Committee on Workforce Issues of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the North American Chapter, International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery (NA-ISCVS) generated data on the numbers and trends of operations performed and workforce requirements to provide surgical care of patients with vascular disease. Data for analysis were obtained from The National Center for Health Statistics-National Hospital Discharge Survey and questionnaires sent to 2732 vascular surgeons. The data showed that SVS/NA-ISCVS and regional vascular society (RVS) surgeons performed 51% of 583,000 vascular procedures undertaken in the United States in 1992. This represents a 24% increase over the 41% reported in 1985 by similarly defined surgeons. Analysis of 1992 index cases documented that SVS/NA-ISCVS and RVS surgeons accounted for 80% of 31,000 aortoiliofemoral bypasses, 68% of 46,000 aortic aneurysmectomies, 64% of 91,000 carotid endarterectomies, and 72% of 98,000 angioaccess procedures. The mean numbers of vascular operations performed in 1992 by SVS/NA-ISCVS and RVS surgeons were 144 and 100, respectively. These procedures represented 64% and 39% of the total surgical caseload of SVS/NA-ISCVS and RVS surgeons, respectively. American Board of Surgery (ABS)-certified vascular surgeons performed a mean of 171 vascular operations in 1992. Other surgeons, including ABS-certified general surgeons, appear to be performing fewer vascular operations. The latter fact and the increasing incidence of vascular disease in an expanding elderly population supports a continued need for vascular surgery specialists. Evolving technology and new health care delivery systems, however, may lessen the need for surgical care of these patients. Continued assessments of workforce activity will allow better definition of changing vascular surgery needs.",

Initial abdominal computed tomography scan showed retroperitoneal hematoma, pancreatic contusion, multiple fractures of the transverse process in the thoraco-lumbar spine, and infrarenal aortic dissection.\nAngiography revealed that the aortic dissection originated proximal to the inferior mesenteric artery and extended down to the left common iliac artery without vascular obliteration. The pancreatic trauma was managed without operation, and the dissection was treated with aortic and left iliac endovascular self-expanding Schneider Wall Stents.\nImmediate angiographic and computed tomography scan examination showed the obliteration of the greater part of the dissection with persistence of a short dissected segment at the level of the aortic bifurcation. Examination a week later showed thrombosis of this false lumen and complete obliteration of the dissection.\nIntravascular stenting allowed treatment of the dissection without open surgical procedures requiring laparotomy and aortic operation.",

Symptoms of lower extremity venous insufficiency resulting from this anatomic abnormality have been reported only once in the English literature, and no experience with surgical treatment of this condition has been published. We report the case of an otherwise healthy 41-year-old man with an 18-month history of severe venous insufficiency involving the right leg manifested by extensive ulceration that did not respond to aggressive conservative treatment. Duplex findings were not suggestive of venous obstruction or reflux, but venography documented no filling of the common iliac vein or inferior vena cava, and outflow was via collaterals to the azygous and hemiazygous systems. Computed tomography demonstrated complete absence of the inferior vena cava with azygous continuation. A prosthetic bypass from the external iliac to the intrathoracic azygous vein was performed with complete symptomatic relief after a 30-month follow-up period. Venous bypass surgery may play a role in treatment of this rare cause of venous insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "Aggressive policies for distal bypass and coronary revascularization increase the need to identify alternatives to autologous saphenous vein grafts. We examined the performance of arm vein as the primary alternative to contralateral saphenous vein when the ipsilateral saphenous vein was not available.\nA total of 250 arm vein grafts were studied retrospectively in 224 patients (143 men, 81 women, 82.6% with diabetes, mean age 68.3 years) from February 1989 to April 1994. Intraoperative angioscopy was carried out to observe valve lysis, remove abnormalities, and select optimal vein segments.\nA total of 85 primary, 103 repeat, and 62 graft revision procedures were done for limb salvage in 99.2% of the patients. A total of 41 femoropopliteal, 114 femorotibial-pedal, 33 popliteodistal, and 62 jump or interposition grafts were constructed. A total of 199 grafts were single vein, and 51 were composite vein. The source was cephalic vein alone in 50.4%, cephalic and basilic vein in 35.6%, and basilic vein only in 14%. The contralateral saphenous vein as an alternative conduit was available in 97 (38.8%) instances. Interventions guided by angioscopy to \"upgrade\" the graft were necessary in 51.6%. Overall early patency (< or = 30 days) was 94.8% (n = 13 occlusions). The cumulative primary patency rate at 1 year was 70.6%, the secondary patency rate was 76.9%, and the limb salvage rate was 88.2%. The 3-year patency rate (limb salvage) was 51.9% (92.4%) for primary grafts, 56.7% (67.1%) in revision grafts, and 42.4% (79.9%) in repeat grafts. In 22.7% (22 of 97) the available contralateral saphenous vein was used for distal revascularization within the follow-up period.\nArm veins are an easily accessible autologous conduit of sufficient length to reach the midtibial level. Excellent patency rates allow durable limb salvage in otherwise difficult circumstances. Vein configuration and splicing do not affect patency rates, but vein quality and repeat operations do. Angioscopy is a valuable adjunct to upgrade graft quality. The contralateral saphenous should be saved for subsequent contralateral revascularization or coronary artery bypass grafting.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to evaluate the accuracy and failure rates of automatically collected oscillometric ankle systolic pressures (Psys) and pulse volumes (Pvol) using a new algorithm as compared with Psys obtained by standard manual Doppler-and-cuff technique.\nOne hundred ten consecutive patients at a vascular laboratory had brachial and ankle Psys measured with the two methods. Pvol at or near the mean arterial pressure was also obtained automatically by the oscillometric device.\nBoth methods showed a 6.6% failure rate when measuring Psys at the ankle. Oscillometric Psys measurement was possible when Doppler Psys failed as a result of nonoccluding arteries. No difference was found between the two methods in occluding limbs with ankle-brachial indexes of 1.30 or more. Sequential brachial Psys values had a mean difference (Doppler-oscillometric) or 2 +/- 10.9 mm Hg and a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.92. Measurements at the ankle had a mean difference of -8.4 +/- 16.8 mm Hg and r = 0.90. These differences were not statistically significant. Mean arterial pressure Pvol recorded at the ankle also correlated with ankle Doppler Psys (r = 0.71) and showed a 1.9% failure rate.\nBoth automatic oscillometric plethysmographic Psys and Pvol at the ankle are shown to correlate well with Doppler-and-cuff Psys in patients with vascular disease. Oscillometric measurements can replace Doppler measurements in most clinical situations.",

Sequential brachial Psys values had a mean difference (Doppler-oscillometric) or 2 +/- 10.9 mm Hg and a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.92. Measurements at the ankle had a mean difference of -8.4 +/- 16.8 mm Hg and r = 0.90. These differences were not statistically significant.

    "abstract": "In patients with intermittent claudication (IC) a structured walking exercise program improves exercise performance. However, few studies have evaluated the effects of exercise training on functional status during daily activities. We hypothesized that a supervised exercise training program would improve functional status in patients with IC, with 24 weeks of training more beneficial than 12 weeks. A secondary aim was to evaluate the effects of strength training and combinations of strength and treadmill training on functional status.\nTwenty-nine men with disabling IC were randomized to 12 weeks of either supervised treadmill training (3 hr/wk at a work intensity sufficient to produce claudication), strength training (3 hr/wk of resistive training of six muscle groups of each leg), or to a nonexercising control group. Functional status was assessed by questionnaires characterizing walking ability (Walking Impairment Questionnaire, WIQ), habitual physical activity level (Physical Activity Recall, PAR), and physical, social, and role functioning, well-being, and overall health (Medical Outcomes Study SF-20, MOS). Patients alos had their activity levels monitored with an activity monitor (Vitalog).\nAfter 12 weeks of treadmill training PAR scores increased by 48 metabolic equivalent hr/wk, the MOS physical functioning score by 24 percentage points, and the number of bouts of walking activity measured by the Vitalog by 4.5 bouts/hr (all p < 0.05). No changes were seen in WIQ scores. After 12 additional weeks of treadmill training improvements initially observed in the PAR, MOS, and Vitalog scores were maintained, and in addition the ability to walk distances (WIQ) improved by 31 percentage points, and the IC severity score had improved by 29 percentage points (both p < 0.05). After 12 weeks of strength training patients improved their WIQ walking speed, stair climbing scores, and MOS well-being scores with no other changes in functional status. Subjects in the control group did not improve functional status by any measure. Twelve weeks of treadmill training after the strength training program maintained WIQ walking speed scores, and activity level defined by Vitalog improved. Twelve weeks of combined treadmill and strength training after the control period had no effect on functional status.\nA supervised treadmill training program improved functional status during daily activities, with 24 weeks more effective than 12. In addition, treadmill training alone was more effective in improving functional status in patients with IC than strength training or combinations of the training modalities.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to evaluate our results of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tibial and peroneal artery bypasses done for limb salvage.\nWithin a group of patients undergoing infrainguinal limb salvage bypasses at our institution between January 1986 and May 1995, 63 patients faced an immediate amputation, had no autologous vein on duplex examination and operative exploration, and had only a tibial or peroneal artery as an outflow vessel for bypass. Most of these patients (82%) had two or more prior ipsilateral infrainguinal bypasses. These 63 patients underwent 66 PTFE bypasses to a tibial or peroneal artery without a distal anastomotic vein cuff or an adjunctive arteriovenous fistula. Our results were then compared with those reported from infrapopliteal (crural) bypasses performed with alternate autologous vein sources or PTFE in conjunction with various recommended adjuncts.\nThe 3- and 5-year cumulative primary graft patency rates for our PTFE infrapopliteal bypasses were 39%+/-7% and 28%+/-9%, respectively. Secondary graft patency rates were 55%+/-8% and 43%+/-10% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Limb salvage rates were 71%+/-7% at 3 years and 66%+/-8% at 5 years. Two-year actuarial patient survival rate was only 67%+/-7%.\nThese results indicate that a PTFE bypass to an infrapopliteal artery remains a worthwhile option in patients without usable autologous vein. The secondary patency and limb salvage rates were acceptable in this setting and were not significantly different from the best results reported with prosthetic tibial/peroneal bypasses with distal vein cuffs or patches (74% at 1 year; 58% at 3 years), arteriovenous fistulas (71% at 1 year) or composite arm vein grafts (39% and 29% at 3 and 5 years, respectively).",

    "abstract": "Increased local production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a potential mechanism underlying structural protein degradation in abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). With an elastase-induced rodent model of AAA, we determined whether pharmacologic treatment with an MMP-inhibiting tetracycline might limit the development of experimental AAA in vivo.\nForty-eight Wistar rats underwent a 2-hour perfusion of the abdominal aorta with 50 U porcine pancreatic elastase and were then treated with either subcutaneous doxycycline (25 mg/day; n=24) or saline solution vehicle (n=24). Aortic diameter was measured before and after elastase perfusion was performed and before the rats were killed at 0, 2, 7, or 14 days, and AAAs were defined as an increase in aortic diameter to at least twice that before perfusion. At death the aortic tissues were either perfusion-fixed for histologic evaluation or extracted for substrate zymographic evaluation.\nAortic diameter was not different between groups at 0 or 2 days, but it was significantly less in animals treated with doxycycline at both 7 and 14 days (mean+/-SEM, p<0.01). After day 2 the incidence of AAA was reduced from 83% (10 of 12 rats treated with saline solution) to 8% (1 of 12 animals treated with doxycycline). By histologic assessment doxycycline prevented the structural deterioration of aortic elastin without decreasing the influx of inflammatory cells. Increased aortic wall production of 92 kD gelatinase observed in a saline solution-treated control group was markedly suppressed in animals treated with doxycycline.\nTreatment with an MMP-inhibiting tetracycline inhibits the development of experimental AAA in vivo. This inhibition may be due to selective blockade of elastolytic MMP expression in infiltrating inflammatory cells. Additional experiments, however, are necessitated to fully delineate this process.",

After day 2 the incidence of AAA was reduced from 83% (10 of 12 rats treated with saline solution) to 8% (1 of 12 animals treated with doxycycline). By histologic assessment doxycycline prevented the structural deterioration of aortic elastin without decreasing the influx of inflammatory cells. Increased aortic wall production of 92 kD gelatinase observed in a saline solution-treated control group was markedly suppressed in animals treated with doxycycline.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the merit of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) extensions and interpositions for the management of failing infrainguinal vein bypass grafts.\nThe treatment of 133 failing vein grafts in 125 patients over a 10-year period was retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-two graft-threatening lesions were detected in patients who did not have a usable autogenous vein conduit as determined by preoperative and intraoperative evaluations. A PTFE extension or interposition graft was used for the necessary reconstruction in all cases.\nTen lesions were within the vein graft, 11 were proximal to the graft in the femoral or popliteal artery segments, and one was distal to the graft in the popliteal artery. The treatment of these lesions included 19 extensions and three mid graft interpositions. The vein graft lesions developed significantly sooner (mean 10.6+/-2.5 months) after the bypass (p<0.05) than the arterial lesions (mean 28.0+/-6.1 months). The 3-year cumulative secondary patency rate for these vein grafts treated with PTFE extensions or interpositions was 84%+/-8%. This was not significantly different from the 3-year cumulative secondary patency rate for vein grafts treated with vein extensions or interpositions at our institution over the same time period (82%+/-10%). The 3-year limb salvage rates were 95% and 89%, respectively.\nThese results indicate that PTFE extensions and interpositions can be used successfully to maintain the patency of failing vein grafts and may serve to prolong limb salvage in patients without any usable autogenous vein. Early reintervention with a PTFE conduit in this difficult group of patients is appropriate to salvage a failing vein graft.",

    "abstract": "The selection of surgeons to participate in a prospective randomized trial comparing the efficacy of a surgical method with medical management is critically important because it will have a direct impact on the outcome of the study and the future use of the operation. We report the success of the method used for selecting surgeons who participated in the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) by examining the surgical morbidity and mortality rates and the outcome of the study.\nA Surgical Management Committee established criteria for auditing surgeons who wished to participate in the study. The parameters included a minimum performance of at least 12 carotid endarterectomies (CEA) per year and an audit of each surgeon's last 50 consecutive CEAs with required documentation of a combined neurologic morbidity and mortality rate of <3.0% for asymptomatic patients and <5.0% for all indications including symptomatic patients.\nAs of February 1991, 164 surgeons from 48 medical centers applied for ACAS participation. One hundred seventeen were approved, and their aggregate experience of 5641 operations yielded a combined neurologic morbidity and mortality rate of 2.3% for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients combined. The morbidity and mortality rate for CEA on asymptomatic patients was 1.7%. These surgeons, plus those recruited after February 1991, became investigators in the ACAS trial and were responsible for the surgical care of 825 patients who were randomized to the surgical arm. Seven hundred twenty-four patients actually underwent CEA. One patient (0.14%) died and ten patients (1.38%) had strokes within the 30-day perioperative interval, for a combined stroke or death incidence of 1.52%. The 5-year stroke event rate in the surgical group (including perioperative morbidity and mortality rates) was 5.1%. compared with 11% of patients treated medically, yielding a relative risk reduction of 53% in favor of surgery (p=0.004).\nA method for selecting surgeons for participation in the ACAS trial was successful in providing low perioperative morbidity and mortality rates. This materially influenced the outcome of the study in favor of CEA.",

    "abstract": "Neointima formation after arterial injury is inhibited by increased blood flow. The object of this study was to determine whether nitric oxide mediates the effect of increased blood flow on neointima formation.\nBalloon catheter-denuded rat carotid arteries were exposed to increased blood flow or control blood flow by ligation of the contralateral carotid artery. Beginning 2 days before balloon denudation, rats were given either saline vehicle alone or the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day or 2 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally. The normalized neointima area was measured 14 days after denudation.\nBlood flow was significantly increased by ligation of the contralateral carotid artery for all drug treatments (p<0.008). In rats given saline vehicle only, normalized neointima area was significantly reduced after increased blood flow compared with control blood flow (0.33+/-0.04 compared with 0.48+/-0.03; p=0.006). Systolic blood pressure was significantly elevated by treatment with high-dose L-NAME (p=0.002 compared with vehicle), but was not altered by low-dose L-NAME (p=NS compared with vehicle). Normalized neointima area was not significantly reduced after increased carotid blood flow for rats treated with either dose of L-NAME (p=NS).\nThe inhibition of neointima formation by increased blood flow was abolished with hypertensive and nonhypertensive doses of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME, which suggests that the L-NAME effects are independent of systemic hemodynamic alterations.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of arterial-wall smooth muscle cells is an important step in the formation of intimal hyperplasia. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a mitogen that exerts its effects through specific receptors located on the cell membrane. IGF-I has been found to promote the multiplication of vascular smooth muscle cells in culture. This study aimed to evaluate the status of IGF-I binding in injury-induced intimal hyperplasia in a rabbit model.\nWe used binding techniques to study IGF-I binding of control and hyperplastic aortas of adult White New Zealand rabbits. Hyperplasia was induced by balloon-catheter injury. At 2 weeks and 1, 2, 4, and 7 months after injury, segments of abdominal aortas were harvested from two control and six study rabbits, and 20-micrometer-thick frozen sections were obtained. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections confirmed the presence of intimal hyperplasia in the hyperplastic aortas. Adjacent sections were incubated in a buffer solution containing 125I-IGF-I in the presence and absence of an excess of unlabeled IGF-I. Autoradiograms were then obtained by apposing the treated sections to autoradiography film, which was developed at 3 days and analyzed by comparison with the hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections under light microscopy. A marked increase in IGF-I binding grain density was observed in the areas corresponding to the hyperplastic lesions. To characterize these binding sites, binding inhibition studies were performed and the dissociation constant (K d) and maximum binding capacity (B max) were obtained from Scatchard analysis.\nSix hyperplastic aortas for each time interval and a total of nine control aortas were evaluated. The K d of the hyperplastic aortas (1.5+/-0.2 nmol/L) was not significantly different from that of control aortas (1.3+/-0.2 nmol/L), which indicated similar high-affinity IGF-I binding sites in normal and hyperplastic arteries. The results of B max were 6.9+/-1.2, 8.5+/-2.1, 12.4+/-2.1, 20.4+/-5.9, 20.6+/-3.2, and 8.1+/-1.3 pmol/L for control, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, and 7 months, respectively. With analysis of variance (p<0.05), B max values at 1, 2, and 4 months were significantly higher than those of control aortas. B max values returned to levels not significantly different from those of control aortas at the 7-month interval.\nIncreased IGF-I binding in the hyperplastic aortas suggests that IGF-I plays an important role in the proliferation of arterial wall cellular components during the hyperplastic process.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation has been implicated as a contributing factor in the expansion of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of a monoclonal antibody (MAB) to the leukocyte CD18 adhesion molecule on the expansion of experimental AAA.\nAneurysms were induced by perfusion of an isolated segment of the infrarenal aorta with elastase in 22 normotensive (WKY) and 17 genetically hypertensive (WKHT) rats. Animals of both strains were randomly allocated to control or MAB-treated groups (MAB, 5 microgram/100 gm body weight intraperitoneally, daily, beginning on the operative day for a total of four doses). The activity of the MAB against rat leukocytes had first been determined by in vitro immunofluorescence flow cytometry. Aortic size was directly measured initially and on day 14. At that time, a segment of aorta was stained with hematoxylin and eosin and mononuclear leukocytes and neutrophils were counted in each of 10 microscopic fields (400X).\nThe initial aortic size in all animals was 1.11+/-0.15 mm. All groups developed aneurysms significantly larger than the initial aortic size (p<0.01). However, the MAB-treated animals had significantly smaller aneurysms than the untreated controls (mm): WKY: 3.63+/-1.26, WKY-MAB: 2.08+/-0.30, WKHT: 4.54+/-1.86, WKHT-MAB: 2.37+/-0.40, p<0.0001. There also were significantly fewer monocytes in the MAB-treated normotensive rats: WKY:35.5+/-29.9, WKHT:40.6+/-28.8, WKY-MAB: 8.9+/-8.5, WKHT-MAB: 32.3+/-25.7, p=0.03. Neutrophil counts did not differ significantly between the groups.\nTreatment with anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody slows the expansion of AAA in this experimental model. The associated inflammatory process at day 14, as indicated by monocyte infiltration, is reduced, but this effect may be opposed by the presence of hypertension. Further evaluation of the role of leukocytes and adhesion molecules in the expansion of AAA is warranted.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the transmembrane signaling pathway by which endothelin-1 (ET-1) enhances monocyte adherence to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and to investigate the role of tyrosine kinases in this mechanism.\nAdherence of purified human blood monocytes to HUVEC monolayers was assessed with radiolabeled monocytes. Tyrosine kinase activation was examined by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting.\nET-1 potentiated monocyte adherence to HUVECs in a biphasic manner with peaks at 10(-10) mol/L and 10(-7) mol/L. A potent antagonist to ET B receptors, when used alone, had no effect. However, the antagonist, when combined with ET-1, significantly enhanced monocyte adherence to HUVECs. Incubation of ET-1 (10(-12) mol/L to 10(-7) mol/L) with HUVECs activated tyrosine kinases in a biphasic manner as identified by immunoblotting with PY20 antibody to tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. Phosphorylated proteins with Mr 60, 110, and 130 kDa were observed after ET-1 stimulation of HUVECs. Of interest, ET A or ET B receptor antagonists failed to antagonize the effect of ET-1. Rather, these receptor antagonists significantly augmented ET-1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation in HUVECs. Immunoprecipitation with antibodies to p60SRC and JAK1 kinases followed by immunoblotting with PY20 antibody suggested that ET-1 receptor response coupling in HUVECs involves the activation of p60SRC and JAK1-like kinases.\nThese data suggest an association between activation of p60SRC and JAK1-like kinases and monocyte adherence in response to ET-1. ET-1-induced monocyte adherence is upregulated by ET B receptor antagonist, suggesting a negative feedback on cell adhesion through this receptor.",

    "abstract": "Telepresence surgery is a novel technology that will allow procedures to be performed on a patient at locations that are physically remote from the operating surgeon. This new method provides the sensory illusion that the surgeon's hands are in direct contact with the patient. We studied the feasibility of the use of telepresence surgery to perform basic operations in vascular surgery, including tissue dissection, vessel manipulation, and suturing.\nA prototype telepresence surgery system with bimanual force-reflective manipulators, interchangeable surgical instruments, and stereoscopic video input was used. Arteriotomies created ex vivo in segments of bovine aortae or in vivo in femoral arteries of anesthetized swine were closed with telepresence surgery or by conventional techniques. Time required, technical quality (patency, integrity of suture line), and subjective difficulty were compared for the two methods.\nAll attempted procedures were successfully completed with telepresence surgery. Arteriotomy closures were completed in 192+/-24 sec with conventional techniques and 483+/-118 sec with telepresence surgery, but the precision attained with telepresence surgery was equal to that of conventional techniques. Telepresence surgery was described as intuitive and natural by the surgeons who used the system.\nBlood-vessel manipulation and suturing with telepresence surgery are feasible. Further instrument development (to increase degrees of freedom) is required to achieve operating times comparable to conventional open surgery, but the system has great potential to extend the expertise of vascular surgeons to locations where specialty care is currently unavailable.",

    "abstract": "The goal of an all-autogenous policy for infrainguinal arterial bypass requires that many bypasses be performed with alternative autogenous veins (AAV) because an adequate length of ipsilateral or contralateral greater saphenous vein (GSV) is not available. The durability and efficacy of infrainguinal vein bypasses constructed of venous conduits other than a single segment of greater saphenous vein (SSGSV) is, however, questioned.\nAAV and GSV bypasses were reviewed from 1980 through 1994. Patients who required bypass to the popliteal or a tibial artery were compared for vascular surgical history and vascular disease risk factors and life-table survival. AAV and SSGSV procedures were compared for indications for surgery, morbidity and mortality rates, limb salvage rates in patients who underwent surgery for limb-salvage indications, subsequent need for revision, and life-table-assisted primary patency.\nNine hundred nineteen autogenous vein bypasses were performed to the popliteal or a tibial artery--187 (20%) with AAVs, including whole or partial arm vein conduits in 144 grafts (77%). One hundred fourteen AAVs (61%) required vein splicing. The mortality rate was 2% for SSGSV bypasses and 1% for AAV bypasses. The morbidity rate was higher for GSV surgery as a result of increased wound complications (11% vs 5%; p=0.02). Sixty-seven percent of patients with AAV bypass extremities had undergone previous ipsilateral arterial surgery, compared with 20% of patients with SSGSV bypasses (p0.0005). AAV bypasses were more likely to be to a tibial artery (71% vs 45%; p<0.0001). Twelve percent of SSGSV and 15% of AAV popliteal bypasses required revision (p=NS). The 5-year assisted primary patencies were 82%, 77%, and 63%, with limb salvage rates of 91%, 86%, and 74% for ipsilateral SSGSV, contralateral SSGSV, and AAV femoropopliteal bypasses, respectively. Twelve percent of SSGSV and 30% of AAV tibial bypasses required revision (p=0.0001). The 5-year assisted primary patencies were 74%, 82%, and 72%, with limb salvage rates of 84%, 92% and 78% for ipsilateral SSGSV, contralateral SSGSV, and AAV femorotibial bypasses, respectively.\nAAV bypasses can provide overall results comparable with SSGSV bypasses.",

The decision to perform AOFBG rather than AXFBG was based on assessment of surgical risk and the surgeon's preference. This report describes results for surgical morbidity, mortality, patency, limb salvage, and patient survival for procedures performed from January 1988 through December 1993.\nWe performed 108 AXFBGs and 139 AOFBGs. AXFBG patients were older (mean age, 68 years compared with 58 years for AOFBG, p<0.001), more often had heart disease (84% compared with 38%, p<0.001), more often underwent surgery for limb-salvage indications (80% compared with 42%, p<0.001). No significant differences were found in operative mortality (AXFBG, 3.4%; AOFBG, <1.0%, p=NS), but major postoperative complications occurred more frequently after AOFBG (AXFBG, 9.2%; AOFBG, 19.4%; p<0.05). Follow-up ranged from 1 to 83 months (mean, 27 months). Five-year life-table primary patency, limb salvage, and survival rates were 74%, 89%, and 45% for AXFBG and 80%, 79%, and 72% for AOFBG, respectively.

    "abstract": "Large multicenter trials (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial, European Carotid Surgery Trial) have documented the benefits of carotid endarterectomy for treating symptomatic patients with >or=70% stenosis of the internal carotid artery. Although color-flow duplex scanning has become the preferred method for noninvasive assessment of internal carotid artery disease, no criteria have been generally accepted to identify this subset of patients. We previously reported a retrospective series to establish such criteria. This study details our results when these criteria were applied prospectively.\nCarotid color-flow duplex scans were compared with arteriograms in 457 patients who underwent both studies. Criteria for >or=70% internal carotid artery stenosis were peak systolic velocity >130 cm/sec and end-diastolic velocity >100 cm/sec. Internal carotid arteries with peak systolic velocity <40 cm/sec in which only a trickle of flow could be detected were classified as preocclusive lesions (95% to 99% stenosis). Arteriographic stenosis was determined by comparing the diameter of the internal carotid artery at the site of maximal stenosis to the diameter of the normal distal internal carotid artery.\nInternal carotid artery stenosis of >or=70% was detected with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 97% positive predictive value of 89%, negative predictive value of 96%, and overall accuracy of 95%. Eighty-seven percent of 70% to 99% stenoses were correctly identified. False-positive errors (n=10) were attributed to contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion or high-grade (>90%) stenosis (n=5) and to interpreter error (n=1); no explanation was apparent in the other four. Eleven of 12 false-negative examinations occurred in patients with 70% to 80% internal carotid artery stenosis.\nIn our laboratories, prospective application of the above velocity criteria identified internal carotid artery stenosis of >or=70% with a reasonably high degree of accuracy. Errors occurred when stenoses were borderline and in patients with severe contralateral disease. With suitably modified velocity criteria, color-flow duplex scanning remains the most reliable noninvasive method for identifying symptomatic patients who are candidates for carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "We developed a monitoring system to detect spinal cord ischemia during aortic cross-clamping (AXC). This system was used to prospectively determine in which patients ischemia occurs, in which patients reimplantation of intercostal arteries is unnecessary or mandatory, and when reperfusion of intercostal arteries (ICAs) is urgent.\nTwo hundred sixty patients underwent thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAA) repair with simple AXC. In 167 patients, two electrocatheters were placed before the onset of anaesthesia at level L1/L2 (stimulation) and level T5/T6 (recording) within the epidural space. During surgery, spinal cord function was monitored by recording spinal somatosensory evoked potentials (sSSEP). According to the extent of aortic replacement, most patients were expected to have a high risk of paraplegia.\nIn group A (59 patients), sSSEP remained normal throughout surgery, and in 54 of these patients ICAs were not reattached outside the proximal aortic anastomosis. In the other five patients ICAs were reimplanted separately because of possible anatomic relation to spinal cord blood supply. No patient in group A had postoperative neurologic deficit. In group B (54 patients) sSSEP remained normal until 15 minutes after AXC but were impaired thereafter. Nineteen patients had early reimplantation of ICAs. Of the 19, three had paraparesis and two had paraplegia. Neurologic deficit developed in the patients without early reimplantation of ICAs. In four patients separate reimplantation of ICAs was performed late in the procedure because of incomplete sSSEP recovery. Subsequently, the sSSEP returned to normal and only one of the four patients had mild paraparesis. The total rate of neurologic deficits in this group was 13% (paraplegia, 3.5%; paraparesis, 9.5%). All 54 patients in group C showed rapid loss of sSSEP within 15 minutes of AXC. In 28 patients ICAs were reimplanted only within the proximal anastomosis. Twenty-one of these patients showed prompt signal recovery after blood-flow release into the reimplanted ICAs, and none had neurologic deficit. Seven patients had no or very late and incomplete sSSEP recovery. Of the seven, three had paraplegia and four had paraparesis. In 26 patients ICAs were reimplanted separately to the proximal anastomosis. This was done early during the procedure in 17 patients, of whom 13 had full recovery of sSSEP and normal neurologic status. Four patients had incomplete or no recurrence of sSSEP, followed by paraplegia in one and paraparesis in three. In nine patients ICAs were reimplanted after the aortic replacement had been completed because of sSSEP recovery was not satisfactory. In all patients in this subgroup sSSEP returned to normal. Six patients had a normal neurologic status and three had mild paraparesis. The total neurologic complication rate in group C was 26% (paraplegia, 7.5%; paraparesis, 18.5%).\nThe risk of ischemic spinal cord injury during replacement for TAA can be assessed continuously by monitoring the sSSEP directly from the spinal cord. Patients without sSSEP changes during aortic reconstruction do not require ICA reattachment and will not have neurologic deficit. Patients who lose sSSEP after AXC are at risk for paraplegia. Patients with impairment or loss of sSSEP >15 minutes after AXC have some collateral vessels, and must have ICAs reimplanted only if sSSEP do not return within normal recovery time after blood-flow release into the proximal anastomosis. Loss of sSSEP within 15 minutes of AXC shows poor collateralization and mandates early restoration of spinal cord blood supply. If the surgeon can achieve the return of sSSEP to normal by subsequent separate reimplantation of ICAS, paraplegia will not occur and paraparesis will be rare and mild. Spinal cord monitoring is a valuable guide to detect whether the spinal cord is at risk and to take measures against par",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate the role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage and distal aortic perfusion (DAP) in the prevention of postoperative neurologic complications for high-risk patients who had undergone type I and type II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair.\nCSF drainage and DAP were used as an adjunct in the treatment of 94 patients with TAAA (31 type I, 63 type II) between September 1992 and December 1994; 67 were men and 27 were women. The median age was 64 years (range, 28 to 88 years). Aortic dissection occurred in 35 of 94 patients (37%). Thirty-six of 94 patients (38%) had previously undergone proximal aortic surgery. All patients underwent intraoperative DAP and perioperative CSF drainage. Median aortic cross-clamp time was 67 minutes (range, 20 to 131 minutes).\nThe 30-day survival rate was 90% (85 of 94 patients). Early neurologic complications occurred in 5 of 94 patients (5%), and late neurologic complications occurred in 3 of 94 patients (3%). We compared the neurologic complications of our current group of 94 patients with the data from 42 patients (control group) who also underwent repair of TAAA type I and type II with only simple cross-clamp and without CSF drainage or DAP. Both groups were treated by the senior author (HJS) at the same institution.

A decision regarding operative fitness was made when the AAA was 5 cm. Patients then underwent operation if fit or continued follow-up if their AAA was larger than 5 cm but they were unfit. A further group of 91 patients with aneurysms 5 cm or greater when first seen but unfit for repair were entered in the prospective measurement program.\nIn the group with AAAs less then 5 cm at entry, operation was performed in 201 patients as a result of increase in AAA size to 5 cm or greater (157), AAA expansion of more than 0.5 cm in 6 months (24), or for other reasons (20).

    "abstract": "Currently no randomized studies show the relative morbidity and mortality of the open and endoluminal methods of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. The aim of this study was to analyze the outcome of two matched groups of patients with AAA, one undergoing open repair and the other undergoing endoluminal repair.\nTwo groups of patients who had undergone repair of AAA by open technique (group 1) or by endoluminal methods (group 2) were compared. A historic control cohort of 27 patients was selected from 56 consecutive patients who underwent open repair of AAA between January 1991 and February 1992. Patients considered unsuitable for the endoluminal method on the basis of computed tomography and aortography were excluded (n=29). Between May 1992 and November 1994 prospective data were recorded for 62 consecutive patients who underwent endoluminal repair by tube or bifurcated endografts. Twenty-eight patients who had been specifically referred for endoluminal AAA repairs because of preexisting severe medical comorbidities were excluded. Six of the endoluminal cases had failure, requiring conversion to open operation, and were excluded for separate analysis, leaving 28 patients in group 2. Patients in both groups were thus fit and suitable for either open or endoluminal repair and were comparable in relation to age, sex, risk factors, dimensions, and form of AAA.\nThe mean values for operation time, blood loss, intensive care stay, and hospital stay for group 1 and group 2 were 2.6 versus 3.1 hours, 1422 versus 873 ml,* 1.8 versus 0.7 days,* and 12.4 versus 11.1 days, respectively (*p<0.05). Local/vascular complications occurred in 15% of patients in group 1 compared with 25% in group 2 (p=0.55), whereas remote/systemic complications occurred in 37% and 29%, respectively (p=0.3). Five of 28 patients in the endoluminal group had complications requiring early operative repair (n=3) or late revision (n=2). When comparison was made on an intention-to-treat basis (with failed procedures included), the incidence of local/vascular complications was significantly greater for endoluminal repair (p=0.047).\nThe incidence of systemic/remote complications was similar for the two groups in spite of significantly less blood loss and shorter intensive care unit stay with endoluminal repair. The incidence of local/vascular complications had a tendency to be higher for endoluminal compared with standard open method (and was significantly greater if failed procedures were included). In this early experience with prototype devices, patients who were medically suitable for open surgical procedures did not derive benefit from the less invasive endoluminal technique with respect to duration of operation, length of hospital stay, or perioperative morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, because they also did not have worse outcome, a randomized study is now justified in this group.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to define outcomes after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers during fiscal years 1991 through 1993.\nWith VA patient treatment file data, patients were selected from diagnosis-related groups 110 and 111 and were then classified in a patient management category. In the categories of repair of nonruptured and ruptured AAA, mortality and postoperative complication rates were defined for patients who underwent AAA repair in VA medical centers during the 3-year study period.\nHospital mortality rates were 4.86% (166 of 3419) after repair of nonruptured AAA and 47.0% (126 of 268) after repair of ruptured AAA (p<0.001). Of 292 deaths after AAA repair, 136 (43.2%) followed repair of ruptured AAA, even though ruptured AAA comprised only 7.3% of total AAA surgical volume. AAA repairs were performed at 116 VA medical centers, with 31.8+/-23.1 (range, 1 to 140) procedures performed at each center. Although many lower-volume centers had excellent results, centers that performed >or=32 AAA repairs tended to have lower in-hospital mortality rates after repair of nonruptured AAA than those that performed <or=31 procedures (4.2%+/-3.5% compared with 6.7%+/-7.8%;p<0.05). Poisson regression analysis revealed an inverse relationship between the volume of AAA repairs and individual hospital mortality (p=0.001) and a direct relationship between illness severity and hospital mortality (p=0.008). The proportion of ruptured AAAs treated in a hospital was also directly related to individual hospital mortality rates (p<0.005). Postoperative complications were associated with an increased hospital mortality rate (11.7% with complication compared with 6.5% without; p<0.0001) and length of stay (23.6+/-17.1 days compared with 18.0+/-12.4 days; p<0.0001). In a logistic regression model, increased mortality rates after AAA repair were associated with hospital type (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=0.6), increasing age (OR=1.1), patient management category severity score (OR=2.2), hemorrhage (OR=2.3), myocardial infarction (OR=2.6), disseminated intravascular coagulation (OR=4.7), AAA rupture (OR=6.0), postoperative shock (OR=10.7), cardiopulmonary arrest (OR=15.4), central nervous system complications (OR=16.0) and urologic complications (OR=2.4).\nMortality rates after AAA repair in VA hospitals were comparable with those previously reported in other large series. Outcomes for veterans with AAA may improve by referring patients eligible for elective repair to VA medical centers with a greater operative volume or to lower-volume centers that have had excellent results.",

Stent removal and iliac/femoral artery resection, as well as an above-knee amputation, were life-saving. Arterial and stent cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. Stent infection with arterial necrosis is a devastating, rare endovascular complication.

    "abstract": "The comparison of wound healing rates in clinical trials presents a challenging problem. Wound healing typically has been expressed as a change in area over time or a percent change in area over time. These methods are inaccurate, however, when applied to wounds of varying size and shape. A relatively small amount of healing in a large wound will produce a greater change in area than in a smaller wound. Conversely, measurement of the percent change in area of a wound will tend to exaggerate the healing rates of smaller wounds. A method of calculating average linear healing of the wound edge toward the center of the wound has been proposed that should not be influenced by wound size: D = delatA divided by P, where D = linear healing, deltaA = change in area, and P = mean perimeter. The purpose of this study was to examine linear healing of the wound edge as a method of measuring wound healing in clinical trials.\nWe observed 39 patients with venous stasis ulcers. The area, perimeter, length, and width of each wound were calculated with computerized planimetry. Change in area per day and linear healing rate of the wound edge per day were calculated. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore factors that influence wound healing as measured by these methods.\nThe change in area per day was significantly and independently influenced by initial area (p < .0001), perimeter (p < .0001), length (p < .00055), and width (p < .0175). Linear healing per day was not influenced by any geometric variable, including area, perimeter, length, width, and ratio of width to length.\nLinear healing per day is a valid means of comparing wound healing rates in wounds of different dimensions. Linear healing per unit of time should be preferred to measurements of change in wound area to quantify wound healing rates in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Direct surgical ligation of incompetent perforating veins has been reported to effectively treat severe chronic venous insufficiency. It is associated, however, with significant wound complications. We evaluate our early experience with endoscopic subfascial division of the perforating veins.\nFrom August 5, 1993, to December 31, 1994, 11 legs in nine patients (five male and for female) were treated with endoscopic subfascial division of perforating veins. Nine of the 11 legs had active or recently healed venous ulcers. Mean duration of the ulcerations was 5.6% years. Standard laparoscopic equipment with 10-mm ports was used to perform clipping and division of medial perforating veins through two small incisions made just below the knee, avoiding the area of ulcer and lipodermatosclerosis. Carbon dioxide was insufflated at a pressure of 30 mm Hg into the subfascial space to facilitate dissection, and a pneumatic thigh tourniquet was used to obtain a bloodless operating field. Concomitant removal of superficial veins was performed in eight limbs. Mean follow-up was 9.7 months (range, 2 to 13 months).\nA mean of 4.4 perforating veins (range, 2 to 7) were divided; tourniquet time averaged 58 minutes (range, 30 to 72). Wound infection of a groin incision and superficial thrombophlebitis were early complications; each occurred in one patient. In seven legs the ulcer healed or did not recur and symptoms resolved. In three legs, the ulceration improved, and in one it was unchanged.\nEndoscopic subfascial division of perforating veins seems to be a safe technique, with favorable early results obtained in a small number of patients. This preliminary experience supports further clinical trials to evaluate this technique.",

    "abstract": "The usefulness of transcranial Doppler monitoring in identifying emboli in the arterial circulation has been established. We attempted to extend this technique to identify embolism in the venous circulation and to note any changes in embolism rate with anticoagulation.\nFrom March to July 1993, 218 patients were evaluated by duplex scan for deep venous thrombosis.\nSixty patients had positive study results; 26 scans (43%) demonstrated embolism. In five patients (19%) the emboli were also seen on a B-mode image, enabling us to estimate embolus size, which ranged from 200 to 5000 micrometer. Embolus counts varied from 5 to 800 per minute. Deep venous thrombosis was located in the iliofemoral vein in 2 patients, superficial femoral/profunda vein in 8, saphenofemoraal junction in 1, popliteal vein in 1, and the calf in 10. Concomitantly, studies in 158 patients were negative for deep venous thrombosis; embolism was detected in 4 patients (3%) in this group. In patients taking heparin, the embolus counts decreased 50% or more within 24 hours, and all embolism was abolished within 72 hours. Two patients died of pulmonary embolus.\nPatients with duplex scans that are positive for deep venous thrombosis have a high incidence of ongoing embolism. Heparin appears effective in eliminating the microemboli detected. The relationship among microembolism, deep venous thrombosis, and clinically significant pulmonary embolism remains to be elucidated.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify the distribution of venous reflux in patients with different patterns of reflux with each class.\nColor-flow duplex imaging was used to evaluate the entire venous system from groin to ankle in 465 patients (594 limbs) belonging to different clinical CVI classes (0, 1, 2, and 3). A history of previous superficial thrombophlebitis was present in five limbs and past deep vein thrombosis in 70.\nOne hundred seventy eight (30%) limbs were normal and the remaining 416 (70%) had venous incompetence. Deep reflux was present exclusively in 19 limbs (3.2%), and the perforation system alone was involved in only three limbs (0.5%). However, isolated superficial incompetence was seen in 186 limbs (31.3%) and a combination of superficial with perforating alone was involved in 45 (7.6%). Incompetence in all three systems was seen in 99 extremities (16.7%). In addition, the superficial system was involved in 390 limbs, the perforators in 151, and the deep system in 178 limbs. Only a small percentage of those in class 0 had reflux, and most of them had a single site of incompetence. In class 1 the majority of the limbs had superficial reflux (90.3%), 10.3% of the limbs had deep venous reflux, and 6.9% were competent. Reflux in the superficial system was only seen in 80.7% of the limbs in class 1 and in one fifth of the limbs in classes 2 and 3. Isolated deep or perforated incompetence was rare in all classes. Variable combined patterns of reflux were seen more often in classes 2 and 3 (p < 0.0001). In classes 2 and 3 there were no differences in the number of incompetent sites in the superficial and deep venous systems or the patterns of reflux (p > 0.1). The number of incompetent perforators in class 3 tended to be higher than that in class 2, especially in the below-knee segment, but no significant differences were seen. Distal reflux was present in the majority of the limbs in all symptomatic classes (1, 2, and 3).\nThe distribution and extent of reflux is strongly associated with clinical severity of CVI through class 2. Distal venous reflux is present in at least 80% of the symptomatic limbs. Deep venous thrombosis may not be a prerequisite for the development of skin changes or ulceration in about 75% of the limbs. Superficial venous surgery could be beneficial to at least one third of patients with skin changes or ulceration.",

PSV was diagnosed in 20 of the 41 (48.8%). In addition, one other patient without KTS had PSV. Thirteen patients (61.9%) were female.

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a noninvasive vascular imaging technique that is more sensitive than contrast arteriography (CA) for the detection of patent distal runoff vessels. This technique has facilitated performance of MRA-directed bypass procedures for patients who were believed not to be bypass candidates because of the absence of a suitable target vessel on the preoperative CA. The fate of bypasses to these angiographically occult runoff vessels is unknown, however, and it has been proposed that patients with angiographically occult runoff may have aggressive occlusive disease, rendering bypass procedures ultimately futile.\nBetween April 1992 and February 1995, 212 autogenous vein infrageniculate bypasses were performed for limb-salvage indications, 22 (12%) to angiographically occult runoff vessels. Results of bypasses performed to angiographically occult vessels were compared with those of bypasses to CA-detected runoff vessels. Life-table analysis of graft-patency and limb-salvage rates was performed.\nThe accuracy of the MRA-predicted patency of angiographically occult vessels was confirmed in every case by the operative findings. Life-table analysis revealed no significant difference in primary graft patency (p > 0.05) or limb-salvage (p > 0.05) rates between patients with bypasses to runoff vessels seen by MRA alone. At 35 months after surgery, the primary graft patency rate was 68% for bypasses to CA-detected vessel bypass and 67% for MRA-detected vessels. The limb salvage rate was 83% for CA-detected vessel bypass patients and 78% for patients with angiographically occult runoff.\nMRA can accurately identify patent runoff vessels not visualized by CA. Results of bypasses performed to angiographically occult runoff vessels are similar to those of bypasses performed to vessels detected by CA. MRA should be performed in patients in whom CA fails to reveal runoff vessels suitable for use in a limb-salvage procedure. The greater sensitivity of MRA may facilitate successful bypass surgery and improve the overall limb-salvage rate.",

    "abstract": "Atheroprotective effects of estrogen (E2) are well documented and are due in part to direct effects of E2 on vascular cells. We recently demonstrated that human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) express a functional E2 receptor capable of activatine gene expression. This study was designed to identify E2-regulated genes in human VSMCs.\nVSMC mRNA was screened by differential-display polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) to identify E2-regulated genes. Quiescent human VSMCs were stimulated with 10% fetal bovine serum in the absence or presence of 10(-8) mol/L E2, and total cellular RNA was harvested. ddPCR was performed in triplicate on each RNA sample and differentially expressed candidate genes were isolated. Differential expression of candidate genes were confirmed by dot blotting and positive bands were identified by sequence analysis. E2-mediated regulation at the protein level was investigated by immunoblotting.\nddPCR of RNA harvested from aortic VSMCs identified a 462 bp gene product, EAo8, as a candidate E2- regulated gene. Dot blotting with probes derived from four independent VSMC cultures demonstrated a 5.8 +/- 3.9-fold increase in EAo8 expression in response to E2 treatment (p < 0.05 vs control). Sequence analysis identified EAo8 as nucleophosmin, a nucleolar phosphprotein implicated in the regulation of cell growth and protein synthesis. E2-induced expression of nucleophosmin protein was demonstrated by immunoblotting in both saphenous vein and mammary artery VSMCs.\nE2 induces nucleophosmin expression in human VSMCs, and ddPCR is a useful approach for studying estrogen-regulated gene expression in VSMCs.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of aortoiliac prosthetic graft infections includes the removal of the infected material and repeat revascularization if necessary. The risk of infection of the graft material used for the repeat revascularization has been the drawback of its use in situ except with autografts. Good results were obtained in this setting by use of in situ arterial allografts. The purpose of our study was to compare in vivo the infectibility of arteries used as allografts to the infectibility of commercially available prostheses.\nTwelve dogs underwent thoracoabdominal aortic bypass with use of either an artery from a human being (n=6) or an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft (n=6). One month later, bacteremia was produced with Staphylococcus aureus. One week after bacterial challenge, the animals were killed to recover the grafts. Each graft then underwent bacterial study.\nNone of the arterial grafts grew bacteria, whereas four of the six ePTFE grafts (p < 0.05) did. In addition, none of the fragments of the arterial grafts grew bacteria, whereas 24 of the 60 ePTFE fragments (p < 0.01) did.\nNonautologous arteries are less infectible than ePTFE in vivo. This decreased infectibility makes the arterial allograft an appealing material when revascularization must be performed in a contaminated field.",

    "abstract": "Transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches to video-assisted aortofemoral bypass were developed and compared using gasless laparoscopic techniques in a porcine model.\nTen pigs were randomized to either a transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach. Aortic clamp time, total operative time, and complications were recorded. Both operations used an external lift device to maintain the working space. Retroperitoneal operations first used serial balloon inflation to dissect the retroperitoneum. After exposure of the infrarenal aorta, a graft was tunneled under endoscopic visualization. End-to-side aortic and femoral anastomoses were created with conventional instruments through 4 cm incisions.\nMean +/- SEM aortic clamp time, operative duration, and graft patency rates were similar for both approaches (difference not significant by unpaired t test). Intraoperative complications related to the use of the laparoscopic technique included injury to the bladder and small bowel (n=2) and occurred only in the transperitoneal group.\nThe use of a gasless technique allowed direct visualization, standard instrumentation, and conventional anastomotic techniques. The retroperitoneal approach used the peritoneal sac to exclude the bowel, simplifying the aortic dissection. Gasless laparoscopic-assisted aortofemoral bypass can be performed by both transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches and holds promise as a minimally invasive treatment for aortoiliac occlusive disease.",

Until now, the validity of color-flow Doppler-assisted duplex imaging in detecting such pathoanatomically defined plaque surface abnormalities is unclear.\nWe prospectively determined the interobserver reliability and validity of detecting plaque ulceration by means of preoperative color-flow Doppler-assisted duplex imaging in 43 consecutive patients with high-grade (> or = 70%) internal carotid artery stenosis, comparing these ultrasonographic findings with pathoanatomic evaluations of the corresponding endarterectomy specimens.\nInterobserver reliabilities for detecting carotid plaque ulceration were kappa= 0.57 for ultrasonography and kappa = 0.82 for the pathologic reference method. Color-flow Doppler-assisted duplex imaging (observer consensus) failed to detect pathoanatomically defined ulceration (chi square = 0.43; p = 0.51). Likewise, sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and positive predictive value were poor (33%, 67%, 56%, and 46%, respectively).\nWe conclude from our data that color-flow Doppler-assisted duplex imaging is not a reliable or valid means to identify plaque ulceration in high-grade carotid artery lesions.",

    "abstract": "Occlusion caused by myointimal hyperplasia appears to be the main reason of late failure of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) arterial bypass grafts. Evidence exists that growth factors are involved in the genesis of myointimal hyperplasia. The aim of this study was to assess the release of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF) by PTFE arterial grafts.\nIn 15 inbred Lewis rats a 1 cm long segment of PTFE was interposed at the level of the abdominal aorta. In a control of another 15 Lewis rats in a vein graft was implanted at the level of the abdominal aorta. Animals were killed four weeks after implantation and the tissue was studied in organ culture for release of PDGF AA, PDGF BB, and bFGF.\nPTFE grafts released a greater quantity of PDGF AA than did control vein grafts (28 +/- 4 ng/cm2/72 hr vs 7 +/- 2 ng/cm2/72 hr). Similarly, PTFE grafts released a greater quantity of bFGF than did arterial vein grafts (308 +/- 22 ng/cm(2)/72hr vs 204 +/- 20 ng/cm2/72 hr).\nWe conclude that PTFE arterial grafts released a high quantity of growth factor, which could explain, in part, the occurrence of distal anastomotic myointimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of epidural regional hypothermia in the prevention of acute and delayed-onset paraplegia, as well as possible complications and limitations of this technique to a clinically acceptable form, were evaluated in 49 New Zealand white rabbits.\nA modified rabbit spinal cord ischemia model of infrarenal aortic occlusion for 30 minutes was employed. The study was performed in two phases. In phase I (n=20), regional hypothermia induced by epidural perfusion of iced normal saline solution (4 degrees C) was tested versus control in 10 rabbits each (groups A and B). In phase II (n=29) the animals were subdivided into three groups to study the kinetics of absorbtion and distribution of methylene blue (group C; n=10), radiographic contrast material (group D; n=9), and measurement of cerebrospinal pressure while an epidural iced solution was or was not infused (group E; n=10).\nAt 24 and 48 hours, all of the normothermic animals showed irreversible paraplegia (Tarlov score 0). In contrast, at 24 hours none of the rabbits undergoing epidural cold infusion were paraplegic, although at 48 hours one animal had weakness of a hindlimb (Tarlov score 3). Plasma concentration-time profiles of a continuous epidural perfusion with methylene blue showed that the spinal canal is a highly compliant space. Epidurographs showed that epidural perfusion tends to spread more in a cephalic than caudal direction and the main uptake is by the vascular compartment. Despite the large volumes infused (78.75 ml/hr; range, 50 to 100 ml), we observed only a modest transient increase in cerebrospinal fluid pressure (from 2.5 +/- 0.3 mm Hg to 5.4 +/- 0.1 mm Hg), although some animals had intracranial hypertension.\nRegional hypothermia induced by epidural cold perfusion has a highly protective effect against the ischemic spinal cord damage. However, this method probably does not avoid the risk of delayed-onset paraplegia. An important limitation of this technique is the difficulty of controlling the intrathecal pressures.",

In contrast, at 24 hours none of the rabbits undergoing epidural cold infusion were paraplegic, although at 48 hours one animal had weakness of a hindlimb (Tarlov score 3). Plasma concentration-time profiles of a continuous epidural perfusion with methylene blue showed that the spinal canal is a highly compliant space. Epidurographs showed that epidural perfusion tends to spread more in a cephalic than caudal direction and the main uptake is by the vascular compartment. Despite the large volumes infused (78.75 ml/hr; range, 50 to 100 ml), we observed only a modest transient increase in cerebrospinal fluid pressure (from 2.5 +/- 0.3 mm Hg to 5.4 +/- 0.1 mm Hg), although some animals had intracranial hypertension.",

    "abstract": "In this study a group of patients undergoing directional atherectomy for localized occlusive disease in the femoropopliteal arteries, the value of intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) to improve the efficacy of plaque removal was evaluated. The findings obtained by IVUS were correlated with intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (IA DSA) performed during the procedure. In addition, the patency rates at follow-up in patients undergoing atherectomy with and without IVUS were compared.\nForty patients were treated by atherectomy because of segmental lesions of the femoropopliteal arteries causing intermittent claudication. Twenty-two patients underwent atherectomy, guided by biplane IA DSA only, and 18 patients were also studied by IVUS. The groups were divided by means of consecutive presentation, IVUS being used in the second part of the study period. The median follow up was 16 months (range, 0 to 40 months). Variables, measured by IVUS during the procedure, were the minimal transverse luminal diameter (MTLD) and the free luminal area. Patency rates at follow-up were determined by regular color flow duplex examinations. Color-flow duplex criteria for occlusions were absence of arterial flow and, for stenosis, a ratio of peak systolic velocities at the diseased segment and a normal segment of 2.5 or greater.\nQualitative IVUS assessment prompted additional atherotome passages because of insufficient atheroma removal or nonaesthetic appearance of the vessel lumen in 15 of the 18 patients who underwent this examination. Only in four of these patients would abnormalities at IA DSA have been a reason for further attempts of atheroma removal. As for the quantitative findings during AT, after a first series of atherectomy passes the mean MTLD of the reference lesion resulted in an increase of the MTLD from a mean of 3.3 +/- 0.7 mm to 3.7 +/- 0.6mm (p = 0.001), and the free luminal area increased from a mean of 11.2 +/- 4.8 mm2 to 12.5 +/- 4.5 mm2 (p = 0.001). However the occurrence of restenosis during follow-up was comparable in patients monitored during the intervention by IVUS (1-year patency rate, 57%) and patients not studied by IA DSA only (1-year patency rate, 64%). In addition, the presence of an intimal dissection or a plaque rupture at IVUS examination did not predict restenosis.\nThe application of IVUS resulted in an improved luminal enlargement by directional atherectomy but not in a better 1-year patency rate.",

    "abstract": "Our purpose was to assess the accuracy and optimal threshold values of the Doppler parameters of the renal arteries and parenchyma for detecting renal artery stenosis (RAS) greater than 60% and occlusion.\nRenal duplex ultrasonography and standard angiographic studies of the renal arteries were performed in 78 patients for comparative analysis. Three degrees of RAS were considered: less than 60%, greater than 60%, and occlusion. The following parameters of the Doppler wave were measured in the signal obtained from the main renal artery and interlobar arteries: peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity, peripheral resistance index, acceleration time, acceleration index, and renal/aortic ratio (RAR).\nLogistic regression analysis identified the PSV in the renal artery as the best parameter to differentiate RAS less than 60% from RAS greater than 60%. Only when this parameter was excluded were the RAR and end-diastolic velocity in the renal artery the variables accepted as the best predictors. Receiver-operator curve analysis revealed a PSV in the main renal artery greater than 198 cm/sec and RAR greater than 3.3 as the best cutoff points for detecting RAS greater than 60%. A PSV above this threshold provided 87.3% sensitivity and 91.5% specificity. The RAR showed similar specificity (92.4% but a much lower sensitivity (76.4%). A kidney length less than 8.5 cm, in addition to an absent Doppler signal in renal parenchyma, was the best criterion to identify renal artery occlusion. On the basis of the above-mentioned criteria, renal duplex scanning correctly identified 86 of 94 cases of RAS less than 60%, 41 of 48 cases of RAS greater than 60%, and six of seven occlusions (kappa value = 0.8).\nThese results suggest that the PSV in the renal artery is the best predicting Doppler parameter to detect RAS greater than 60%. A PSV greater than 198 cm/sec may be an appropriate cutoff point to diagnose this group of stenosis. The RAR did not add any predicting utility in this series. An absent Doppler signal in the renal parenchyma and a kidney length less than 8.5 cm were the best predictors of renal artery occlusion.",

Large-dose thiopental sodium without shunting was used for cerebral protection during endarterectomy. Asymmetric electroencephalogram changes during the operation, carotid occlusion time, stroke onset, and neuropathologic outcomes were analyzed.\nThree contralateral strokes occurred in the series, producing a cerebral morbidity/mortality rate of 1.2% (major 0.4%, minor 0.8%). Transient morbidity was 1.9% made of two reversible ischemic neurologic deficits and three transient ischemic attacks. New asymmetric electroencephalography changes were seen in 49 (19% patients, one of whom had transient deficit. Average occlusion time was 35 minutes. All strokes occurred within 24 hours of the procedure. Patients with previous stroke and and systemic hypertension seemed at greatest risk, and the contralateral hemisphere was the area at greatest risk. All transient deficits were ipsilateral and related to technical complications rather failed protection.\nThiopental cerebral protection eliminates strokes caused by complications of shunting, prevents ischemic stroke during carotid occlusion for periods up to 67 minutes (average 35 minutes), allows meticulous management of the operative site, may modify or minimize clinical neurologic deficit, and in our experience has rendered intraluminal shunting obsolete.",

Ten animals were controls, 10 animals received 2.25% L-arginine supplementation in their drinking water (200 ml/day; 2 gm/kg) 7 days before surgery and continued thereafter until harvest, in 10 animals the veins were immersed in deferoxamine manganese (DFMn; 10(-3) mol/L in heparinized Ringer's lactate for 15 minutes) before implantation, and 10 received both L-arginine supplementation and either histologic (n=6) or isometric tension studies (n=4). The function of the vein grafts was compared with that of jugular veins.\nTreatment with DFMn, l-arginine, amd DFMn L-arginine produce increases in mean intimal thickness of 39% (51 +/ -7 microm; p<0.05), 51% (41 +/- 7 microm; p<0.05), and 65% (29 +/- 6 microm; p< 0.01), respectively, compared with control vein grafts (83 +/- 12 microm).

Jugular veins relaxed to acetylcholine (53% +/- 12% maximal relaxation), whereas control vein grafts did not relax. In contrast, vein grafts from each of the experimental groups relaxed to acetylcholine with maximal relaxations of 26% +/- 7% (p<0.05 compared with the jugular vein), 22% +/- 8% (p<0.05), and 44% +/- 14% (difference not significant) in the DFMn, L-arginine, DFMn/L-arginine groups, respectively.

    "abstract": "Our purpose was to investigate the hemodynamic theory that the blood flow rate through a stenotic arterial graft is limited by the onset of turbulence, which acts as a barrier at peak systole against further increases in systolic flow.\nWe used duplex ultrasonography to examine 25 stenotic infrainguinal vein grafts. Theory predicts that the flow limitation occurs at peak systole at a stenotic velocity greater than 250 cm/sec, which corresponds to a residual stenotic lumenal diameter of 0.36 cm (Reynolds No. 2000). These numbers are based on the assumption that the 68 ml/min blood flow is supplied by the femoropopliteal graft to the resting lower leg only during systole. When the lumen is smaller than 0.36, peak systolic velocity (PSV) must exceed 250 cm/sec. The increased velocity results in poststenotic turbulence. This turbulent condition restricts the average graft systolic flow to less than the 68 ml/min required by the lower leg, so diastolic flow is needed to make up the deficit.\nTwenty vein grafts with PSVs of 250 cm/sec or greater had end-diastolic velocities of 50 cm/sec or greater as predicted; three grafts with PSVs of 256 to 300 cm/sec and two grafts with PSVs of less than 250 cm/sec had no forward diastolic flow.\nThe onset of turbulence in a stenotic vein graft supplying the lower leg occurs at a PSV of 250 cm/sec or greater. The appearance of diastolic flow maintains the average graft volume flow.",

    "abstract": "This study tests the clinical value of femoral artery pressure measurements by analysis of the relationship between iliac artery pressure gradients (PGs) and both femorofemoral bypass graft patency and the hemodynamic changes produced in the donor and recipient limbs.\nSystemic and donor femoral artery systolic and mean pressures were measured during surgery at rest and during papaverine-induced hyperemia before 94 femorofemoral bypasses. Ankle/brachial (A/B) pressure ratios and pulse volume recordings (PVRs) were measured before and early after surgery. Donor iliac artery stenosis was 25% +/- 23% (mean +/- 1 SD). Follow-up was 23+/- 20 months.\nEight bypasses failed at 21 +/- 20 months. Patients with failed bypasses had a resting systolic and mean PG of 23 +/- 22 mm Hg and 5 +/- 7 mm Hg, respectively, compared with 10 +/- 11 mm Hg (p = 0.007) and 1 +/- 2 mm Hg (p = 0.001) for the 86 patent bypasses. Donor limb A/B ratios and PVRs decreased 9% +/- 5% and 15% +/- 14%, respectively, had a linear regression slope less than 0 (p < 0.05) with resting and hyperemic PGs, and correlated best with resting PGs (p < 0.05). Recipient limb A/B ratios and PVRs increased 86% +/- 48% and 191% +/- 111%, respectively, had a linear regression slope greater than 0 (p < 0.05) with all resting and hyperemic PGs, and correlated best with hyperemic systolic PGs (p < 0.05). However, all regressions had a large SD, wide 95% confidence limit, and a low correlation coefficient. Sensitivity-specificity receiver-operating characteristic curves for optimal PG criteria for both graft failure and donor limb hemodynamic impairment are weak, with an accuracy of 50% to 75%. Recommended criteria for not performing a femorofemoral bypass are a resting systolic PG of 28 mm Hg or greater or a resting mean PG of 6 mm Hg or greater.\nAlthough iliac artery PGs correlate with graft failure and both the degree of donor limb hemodynamic impairment and recipient limb improvement, the large variability in PGs between patients with similar outcomes and the low accuracy of optimal PG criteria indicate that they have limited clinical value in decision making.",

Preoperative serum creatine phosphokinase level was 10,900 IU/ml. During aortofemoral reconstruction, both limbs were reperfused with a potassium-free, blood-cardioplegia-like perfusate. Fasciotomies were not necessary. After operation, maximal serum creatine phosphokinase levels remained below 10,000 IU/ml. Limb sensitivity and motor function were normal. Even for prolonged acute aortoiliac occlusion, a simplified controlled limb-reperfusion may preserve skeletal muscle and nerve function and prevent local and systemic complications caused by reperfusion damage.",

A computed tomographic scan showed gas in the wall of the descending thoracic and suprarenal aortas. Emergency thoracoabdominal exploration revealed a necrotizing infection of the thoracic aorta extending to the origin of the celiac axis. After surgery Clostridium septicum was identified in tissue culture. Surgical management consisted of in-situ graft replacement of the thoracoabdominal aorta. Three months later, a pseudoaneurysm developed at the distal anastomosis. The patient refused further surgery and died 3 days later. The cause of death was presumed to be a ruptured mycotic aneurysm as a result of recurrent C. septicum infection. The relationship of C. septicum with occult gastrointestinal and hematologic malignancy has been documented. This patient represents the 10th reported case of C. septicum arteritis. Including the nine previous case reports of C. septicum arteritis, the mortality rate is 70%. When evaluating a patient with a mycotic aneurysm or aortitis, C. septicum should be considered. If it is found, a search should be carried out for an associated gastrointestinal or hematologic malignancy. Surgical repair should include extraanatomic revascularization and wide debridement of the infected field. Consideration should be given to lifelong antimicrobial therapy for this potentially fatal infection.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic colitis is an infrequent but potentially devastating complication of abdominal aortic reconstruction. Identification of patients with predisposing risk factors for the development of ischemic colitis can guide intraoperative measures to preserve or restore colonic blood flow during aortic surgery. Previous radiation therapy for pelvic malignancy may be one such predisposing risk factor. Two cases are presented in which ischemic colitis complicated abdominal aortic reconstruction in the setting of previous pelvic irradiation. In the months after radiation therapy for prostate cancer, one patient underwent infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Ischemic infarction of the sigmoid colon developed acutely after surgery and required emergent sigmoid colectomy. The second patient underwent reconstruction of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm after having had radiation therapy for a bladder tumor. Despite an initial satisfactory result, the patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea progressively worsened and he eventually required sigmoid colectomy for severe ischemic colitis. In both of these patients, the inferior mesenteric arteries were patent and had not been reimplanted. The association of pelvic radiation therapy with ischemic colitis after aortic reconstruction should focus attention to the operative details for maintaining the colonic circulation in these patients. Reimplantation of the inferior mesenteric artery in particular may prevent both the acute and the insidious variants of this complication in patients who undergo aortic surgery and decrease the incidence of this complication in patients with a history of radiation therapy to the pelvis.",

    "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been demonstrated to inhibit experimental intimal hyperplasia and to lead to expedient reendothelialization but negligible repopulation of the vessel media. The mechanism that underlies the differential ingrowth of cells into PDT-treated vessel segments is not understood. Because the extracellular matrix (ECM) is known to modulate specific cell functions, this study was designed to determine whether PDT of isolated ECM affects the function of endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs).\nPDT of bovine aortic EC-ECM was performed with chloroaluminum sulfonated phthalocyanine and 675-nm laser light. Control specimens included untreated ECM, ECM-free plates, and ECM exposed to either light or photosensitizer only. Cell function was characterized by attachment, proliferation, and migration of ECs or SMCs that were plated onto identically treated matrixes.\nSMC attachment (86% +/- 0.4% vs 95% +/- 0.4%), proliferation (46% +/- 0.5% vs 100% +/- 1.4%), and migration (40% +/- 1.0% vs 100% +/- 0.9%) were significantly inhibited after PDT of ECM when compared with untreated ECM (all p < 0.001). In contrast, PDT of ECM significantly enhanced EC proliferation (129% +/- 6.2% vs 100% +/- 6.2%; p < 0.03) and migration (118% +/- 2% vs 100% +/- 0.8; p < 0.01), but did not affect attachment.\nThis report establishes PDT-induced changes in the ECM with a result of inhibition of SMCs and stimulation of EC functions. It provides insight into how PDT-treated arteries can develop favorable EC repopulation without SMC-derived intimal hyperplasia. These findings may help provide a better understanding of the interactions between cells and their immediate environment in vascular remodeling.",

    "abstract": "To assess iliac artery stenosis before and up to 1 year after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with duplex ultrasound (DUS) to determine the incidence of residual and recurrent stenoses and correlate these findings to clinical outcome.\nSixty-one patients with 70 iliac artery segments treated with PTA were examined. The peak systolic velocity (PSV) ratio (PSV ratio = PSV in stenosis divided by PSV proximal or distal to stenosis) was determined by DUS before PTA and 1 day, 3 months and 1 year after PTA. Three categories of results were identified by using PSV ratios at the site of the treated stenosis 1 day and 1 year after PTA (good result, residual stenosis, and recurrent stenosis). The DUS-determined anatomic result was correlated with the clinical outcome at 1 year. Clinical outcome was classified according to Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery (SVS/ISCVS) criteria.\nGood results with DUS (PSV ratio 1 day and 1 year after PTA > or = to 2.5) were found in 45 of 70 segments (64.3%), residual stenoses (PSV ratio > or .5 1 day after PTA) in 15 of 70 segments (21.4%), and recurrent stenosis (PSV ratio 1 day after PTA < 2.5 and 1 year after PTA > or = 2.5) in 10 of 70 segments (14.3%). PSV ratios of residual stenoses decreased significantly between 1 day and 1 year after PTA because some residual stenoses improved hemodynamically in time. Clinical results were significantly better in patients with a good result compared with other patients. However, the clinical outcome of patients with residual stenoses was not significantly different from the patients with good DUS results.\nSome residual stenoses improved sonographically after PTA. Clinical results at 1 year are highly variable within different groups. Clinical outcome of patients with residual stenoses did not differ from patients with good DUS results, whereas clinical outcome in patients with recurrent stenoses was worse than in the other groups.",

    "abstract": "In June 1989, we set out to implant 200 albumin-coated aortic bifurcation grafts and to track the patients for a period of 5 years to determine whether coating the prosthesis with albumin affected the patency or the incidence of complication. Two hundred and one prostheses were implanted between June 1989 and July 1991. The primary and secondary patency at 5 years was 95% and 98%, respectively. No relation between gender and patency or between the state of the runoff and patency was found, but there was a statistically significant relation between age and patency (p = 0.00). Graft infection was recorded in three patients (1.5%). There were no instances of bleeding through the graft at the time of implantation. The mean intra- and postoperative blood requirement was 2 units. There have been no incidences of false aneurysm in the groin. We conclude that there are no disadvantages of coating the prosthesis with albumin, and a trial of coated versus uncoated prostheses would be impractical.",

    "abstract": "Recent information indicates that large, sustained wall shear stress gradients are a dominant hemodynamic parameter associated with the location and severity of atherosclerosis and myointimal hyperplasia. This study computes the spatial values of wall shear stresses and their gradients for three carotid artery bifurcation geometries.\nA computational fluid dynamics program was used to solve the transient two-dimensional partial differential equations that describe fluid flow. Blood was treated as both a Newtonian and a non-Newtonian incompressible fluid. Solutions for the velocities, wall shear stresses, and wall shear-stress gradients were obtained for three carotid bifurcation geometries: a normal carotid bifurcation (similar to a primarily reconstructed carotid endarterectomy), a patch-reconstructed carotid endarterectomy, and a gradually tapered, low-angle carotid bifurcation (no carotid bulb).\nComputed velocity profiles closely match published experimental ones. Disturbed flow velocities are largest in the bulb segment of the normal carotid bifurcation. Peak and minimum wall shear stresses and peak shear stress gradients occurred in the lateral internal carotid artery wall. These were binodal in the normal or primarily reconstructed carotid artery, localized at the distal end of the patch-reconstructed carotid bifurcation, and minimal in the smooth, tapered carotid bifurcation. Wall shear stresses and their gradients were slightly higher for non-Newtonian than Newtonian fluids in the normal carotid artery but were similar in the other two geometric configurations.\nThese results indicate that flow disturbances in general and wall shear stress gradients in particular are markedly reduced in carotid artery bifurcations that are smooth and gradually tapered and do not have a bulb. Abrupt geometric wall changes such as those occurring in the normal carotid bulb and at the distal end of a patch-reconstruction after carotid endarterectomy are harbingers of disturbed flow and high wall shear stress gradients. These results suggest that carotid endarterectomy reconstruction geometry characterized by a gradually tapered internal carotid artery may minimize the hemodynamically induced component of early myointimal hyperplasia and thrombosis and late atherosclerotic restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Despite advantages demonstrated in vitro, no single thrombolytic agent has been clearly shown to be superior to another in the clinical setting. Prourokinase has recently received attention as a new thrombolytic agent with higher fibrin specificity. The thrombolytic activity of prourokinase, however, remains ill defined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate thrombolysis with prourokinase in comparison to urokinase in vitro.\nWe used an in vitro parallel channel perfusion model that simulates catheter-directed thrombolysis in the peripheral arterial system. Radiolabeled thrombi were subjected to 90 minutes of endhole catheter-directed infusion with either prourokinase 5000 IU/ml, urokinase 5000 IU/ml; or 5% dextrose in water at 4 ml/hr.\nProurokinase and urokinase were found to be equivalent with respect to thrombolytic effect. Percent lysis was maximal at 90 minutes in both the urokinase and prourokinase groups. Prourokinase and urokinase were found to be equally effective in restoring flow through thrombosed graft segments.\nProurokinase appears to offer little benefit over urokinase with respect to thrombolytic activity in an in vitro model that closely resembles the clinical setting. If prourokinase is to be accepted as an alternative to urokinase, advantages must relate to differences in fibrin specificity.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the wall thickening observed in vein grafts after they were placed into the arterial circulation could be inhibited by periadventitial delivery of an insoluble sulfated polymer of beta-cyclodextrin (P-CDS) capable of tightly binding heparin binding growth factors.\nThirty-four New Zealand white rabbits underwent implantation of reversed autologous jugular vein interposition grafts in the common carotid artery and were randomized to receive either 20 mg P-CDS (n = 18) topically around the graft or no additional therapy (n = 16). Before being killed at 28 days, animals were given bromodeoxyuridine to assess smooth muscle cell proliferation. Histomorphometric analyses were performed after perfusion fixation.\nCompared to controls, treatment with P-CDS was associated with reduced mean intimal thickness (24 +/- 3 vs 38 +/- 4 microns; mean SEM, p < 0.01) and intimal area (0.25 +/- 0.03 vs 0.54 +/- 0.09 mm2; p < 0.01). There was also significantly less medial thickness in the P-CDS group (45 +/- 3 vs 63 +/-3, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in intimal or medial smooth muscle cell proliferation between P-CDS-treated and control vein grafts at 28 days. The polymer persisted in the adventitia with a mild foreign body reaction.\nPeriadventitial placement of P-CDS, a novel, insoluble, sulfated carbohydrate polymer, inhibits intimal and medial thickening of vein bypass grafts in this model of vein grafting. The persistence of P-CDS in vivo for prolonged periods, and the ease of topical application of P-CDS during vascular bypasses may have important implications for its future use in vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "Many surgeons advocate uniform performance of operative completion arteriography after leg bypass surgery to ensure technical success and to optimize short- and intermediate-term graft patency. To determine the impact of this practice on the outcome of reversed-vein bypass surgery and associated patient charges, we reviewed our series of consecutive nonemergent leg bypass procedures. Ninety-three infrainguinal bypass procedures were performed in 80 patients (76 men and 4 women) from September 1991 to August 1994. The patients' average age was 67 years (range, 30 to 92 years). Follow-up (mean, 113.1 months; range, 1 to 36 months) was available on 91 grafts (97%). Indications for surgery included limb salvage in 75 cases, claudication in 12 cases, and popliteal aneurysm exclusion in 6 cases. All patients survived surgery. Primary graft patency rates as determined by life-table analysis were 87%, 81%, 78%, and 78% at 6 months and at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Limb-salvage rates were 95%, 91%, 87% and 87% at the same intervals. Bypass procedures were divided into two groups. The 25 grafts in group 1 were evaluated with inspection, continuous-wave Doppler insonation, and routine completion arteriography. The 68 grafts in group 2 were evaluated by inspection and insonation alone. Fourteen grafts occluded after surgery (average, 5 months; range, 1 to 12 months), five in group 1 and nine in group 2. The likelihood of graft occlusion was similar in both groups (p = 0.42). The optimal method of confirming technical adequacy after bypass surgery in the clinically satisfactory graft remains uncertain. Charges for completion arteriography at our institution average $700, including 15 minutes of additional operative time. In our experience, these charges do not appear to be justified by improved short- or intermediate-term graft patency rates in reversed-vein grafts when completion arteriography is performed.",

    "abstract": "It is now possible to grade aortoiliac stenoses in broad categories based on peak systolic velocity (PSV) changes. The goal of this study was to see whether additional simple Doppler parameters would improve the grading of aortoiliac obstructive disease.\nDuplex parameters were compared in 112 aortoiliac segments with four categories of arteriographic diameter reduction and four categories of common femoral artery pressure measurements. These parameters were PSV, PSV ratio, PSV difference, end diastolic velocity (EDV), the presence or absence of reverse flow, and the presence or absence of spectral broadening.\nThe discriminative value of the PSV ratio was better than that of either the absolute PSV value or the PSV difference. A PSV ratio < 1.5 combined with reverse flow and a clear systolic window in the Doppler spectrum predicted a diameter reduction < 20% (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 58%; positive predictive value [PPV], 89%; negative predictive value [NPV], 100%; accuracy, 90%). For the detection of > or = 50% aortoiliac stenoses, a PSV ratio > or = 2.8 provided 86% sensitivity and 84% specificity (PPV, 84%; NPV, 85%, accuracy, 85%). An absolute PSV value of 200 cm/sec has a high sensitivity (95%) but a low specificity (55%) in identifying > or = 50% stenoses (PPV, 68%; NPV, 91%; accuracy 75%). An EDV > 0 cm/sec at the stenosis indicates a femorobrachial pressure index < 0.90 with 51% sensitivity and 89% specificity. An EDV > or = 40 cm/sec indicates a femorobrachial index < 0.80 with 50% sensitivity and 89% specificity, and indicates > or = 75% arteriographic stenoses with 70% sensitivity and 90% specificity (PPV, 64%; NPV, 92%; accuracy, 86%). A stenosis > or = 75% was also identified by a PSV ratio of 5.0 with 65% sensitivity and 91% specificity (PPV, 65%; NPV, 91%; accuracy, 86%).\nThe PSV ratio is the most important parameter to grade aortoiliac stenoses into < 20%, 20% to 49%, 50% to 74%, and 75% to 99% categories, but additional parameters such as absolute PSV value, EDV, and the presence or absence of reverse flow and spectral broadening in the Doppler spectrum are helpful in gradation.",

Use of diagnostic angiography, use of carotid duplex ultrasound, length of hospital stay, postanesthesia recovery observation, intensive care unit (ICU) observation, complications, and hospital charges were analyzed.\nThe average length of hospital stay decreased from 6.18 days to 2.00 days (p < or = 0.001). The day of discharge decreased from 3.10 days to 1.24 days after surgery (p < or = 0.01). By 1993, 68% were discharged by the first day after surgery, increasing to 73% by 1994. From 1990 to 1992, average postoperative ICU observation time fluctuated between 18 and 25 hours; this time decreased to 12.2 hours by 1994.

Whereas plasma levels of PAI were similar throughout the 6-month follow-up period, t-PA increased significantly 1 week after diagnosis and decreased thereafter. Both DD and TFPI levels decreased significantly after diagnosis compared with presentation values. Comparing these assay levels between patients with complete resolution versus partial or no resolution, PAI levels were significantly higher during the first week in patients with poor outcome. Plasma levels of t-PA were higher in cases with good outcome, and DD levels were higher in patients with poor outcome. TFPI levels were similar in both outcome groups.\nPatients with complete DVT resolution on duplex scanning at 6 months had significantly lower levels of PAI on presentation and after 1 week than did those with incomplete lysis. Although differences were not significant, t-PA levels were higher and DD lower in patients with good outcome. Our results suggest that certain plasma fibrinolytic assays might correlate with the outcome of DVT, as assessed by duplex ultrasonography.",

    "abstract": "The best way to quantitate venous reflux is still a matter of debate. Duplex-derived valve closure time (VCTs) have been used recently because they can be measured easily. We examined the relationships between VCT and duplex-obtained quantitation of venous volume and between VCT and air plethysmography (APG). Sixty-nine legs in 45 patients with varying clinical degrees of chronic venous insufficiency were studied by duplex scan and APG. VCTs were compared with duplex-derived flow calculations and with APG-derived venous filling index and residual volume fraction. The patient's mean age was 47.5 +/- 13.9 years; the mean duration of their symptoms was 13 +/- 4 years. Twenty percent had a history of deep venous thrombosis, and 29% had undergone venous surgery. No correlation was found between VCT and flow volume or between VCT and flow at peak reflux at any of the anatomic locations studied: saphenofemoral junction, greater saphenous vein, lesser saphenous vein, superficial femoral vein, profunda femoris vein, and popliteal vein. Likewise, no correlation was found between total VCT and APG-derived venous filling index or between total flow volumes and APG-derived residual volume fraction. Total VCT and total flow volumes did, however, have a moderate correlation (r = 0.65; p = 0.0003). Duplex-derived VCTs, although extremely useful in determining the presence of reflux, do not correlate with the magnitude of reflux, and should not be used to quantitate the degree of reflux.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is a known clinical risk factor for atherosclerosis. In experimental atherosclerosis, monocyte adhesion to the endothelial surface is enhanced and is considered to be an important early stage in plaque formation. We tested the hypothesis that hypertension enhances monocyte adhesion in experimental atherosclerosis.\nTwenty-two New Zealand White rabbits were fed an atherogenic diet for 3 weeks to induce plaque formation. Aortic coarctation was created in eight rabbits by wrapping a Dacron band around the midportion of the descending thoracic aorta (stenosis group), whereas six rabbits underwent banding without aortic constriction (no stenosis group). Eight rabbits served as nonoperated controls. Monocyte binding to the aortic endothelial surface was counted with epifluorescent microscopy on standard aortic segments proximal and distal to the band. Immunohistochemistry was performed for the following antibodies: VCAM-1, RAM11, CD11b, and factor VIII.\nMean blood pressure was 89 +/- 3 mm Hg in the aorta proximal to the stenosis, compared with 64 +/- 4 mm Hg in the no stenosis group and 74 +/- 3 mm Hg in the control group (p < 0.01). The mean aortic blood pressure gradient across the stenosis was 16 +/- 2 mm Hg in the stenosis group, whereas the aortic blood pressure gradient was 0.2 +/- 0.6 mm Hg in the no stenosis group and -0.3 +/- 0.4 mm Hg in the control group (p < 0.001). Monocyte adhesion to the aortic endothelial surface proximal to the stenosis was increased twofold compared with adhesion to the aorta distal to the stenosis and compared with the proximal aorta in the control group (p < 0.02). The proximal-to-distal aortic ratio of monocyte binding was enhanced in the stenosis group (2.2) compared with the no stenosis (0.76) and control (0.83) groups (p < 0.01). The intima area of the aorta proximal to the stenosis was significantly increased compared with the proximal aortas in the no stenosis and control groups (p < 0.01). RAM11, CD11b, and endothelial VCAM-1 expression were enhanced in the hypertensive region proximal to the stenosis.\nIn the hypertensive region in the aorta proximal to the stenosis, monocyte adhesion and endothelial VCAM-1 expression were increased, with intimal thickening and accumulation of macrophages. These findings suggest that hypertension may promote atherosclerotic plaque formation by enhancing monocyte adhesion.",

Patient follow-up was obtained by a surveillance protocol, with duplex scanning performed 3 months after surgery and yearly thereafter.\nTwenty-four EICAA in 20 patients were treated over a 21-year period. The cause was fibromuscular dysplasia in 12 cases (50%), nonspecific \"atherosclerosis\" in nine (37.5%), previous carotid artery surgery in two (8.3%), and trauma in one case (4.1%). Neurologic symptoms were present in a total of nine cases (37.5%) and were hemispheric in seven (29.1%) and nonhemispheric in two (8.3%). Operative techniques were performed with patients receiving general anesthetic and included aneurysm excision with internal carotid artery reanastomosis (8 cases [33.3%]) or reimplantation onto the external carotid artery (1 case [4.1%]); interposition graft (10 cases [41.6%]), 7 veins, 3 polytetrafluoroethylene) or simple aneurysmectomy and closure of the wall defect either with (3 cases [12.5%]) or without (2 cases [8.3%]) a patch. Elective surgery was performed in 22 cases, with a 0% mortality rate and 4.5% stroke rate. Emergency operations were performed in two cases of ruptured aneurysms (one spontaneous and one iatrogenic); one patient (50%) died. Cranial nerve morbidity occurred in five cases (20.8%). Mean follow-up was 96.7 +/- 88.15 months (range 4 to 240 months) and included 2 of 7 (28%) complications in saphenous vein grafts, 1 (4.1%) late transient ischemic attack, and a recurrent aneurysm after 19 years.\nSymptoms and potential complications caused by EICAA suggest a broad surgical indication.

    "abstract": "Most surgeons perform some type of endarterectomy of the external carotid artery (ECA) routinely during standard carotid endarterectomy (CEA). This approach has been shown to result in a small percentage of ECA occlusions, the clinical significance of which remains poorly understood. We have modified our approach to the management of the ECA during standard CEA by averting any attempt at external CEA. To evaluate the natural history of the untreated ECA after CEA, we reviewed the preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up duplex scans obtained from 232 CEAs over the past 4 years.\nPreoperative and postoperative carotid artery duplex examinations with specific evaluation of the extent of ECA stenosis were available for review on 114 CEAs performed between January 1991 and July 1994. All CEAs were performed for internal carotid artery stenosis greater than 75% as determined by duplex scanning, which was confirmed by either contrast arteriography or magnetic resonance angiography.\nSeventy-three (64.0%) procedures were performed for symptomatic lesions, whereas 41 (36.0%) were performed for asymptomatic stenosis. There were no perioperative strokes or transient ischemic attacks in this group, and there was one postoperative death (0.9%). Short- and intermediate-term follow-up demonstrated insignificant changes in ECA diameter after operation, with no cases of ECA occlusion and only five cases progressing to greater than 75% on the 1-year follow up duplex examination.\nWe conclude from these data that averting external CEA during standard CEA does not result in significant progression of ECA stenosis or occlusion.",

To determine the impact of early onset of atherosclerosis on outcome, we decided to compare a group of these patients with a group of patients with typical onset of atherosclerosis with regard to early complications, indications for intervention, site of disease at initial presentation (aortoiliac, infrainguinal, or cerebrovascular), and long-term outcomes (secondary revascularization, amputation, and death).\nAll patients younger than 50 years old requiring operative intervention between 1987 and 1992 were retrospectively compared with a group of patients greater than 60 years old, randomly selected from patients who underwent operation during the same time period. Patients were evaluated and compared for indications, risk factors, and early and late outcomes.\nPatients with early onset atherosclerosis at the aortoiliac or infrainguinal level had a higher late amputation rate (17% versus 3.9%, p = 0.02) and poorer overall outcome than their older cohorts. Patients with cerebrovascular disease in both cohorts had similarly good prognoses.\nAortoiliac or infrainguinal disease diagnosed in patients less than 50 years of age portends a poorer outcome than does similar disease in an older patient population.",

    "abstract": "The factors that lead to myointimal hyperplasia (MH) in arterial vein grafts (AVGs) are unknown. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF) are two powerful mitogens for smooth muscle cells that have been implicated in the genesis of MH. The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between progression and regression of MH and production of PDGF and bFGF in experimental vein grafts.\nIn 64 inbred Lewis rats, a 1-cm segment of inferior vena cava was inserted at the level of the abdominal aorta. The segments of inferior vena cava were obtained from syngenic rats. In 48 rats, the AVG was explanted 3 days (n = 8), 7 days (n = 8), 4 weeks (n = 24), and 12 weeks (n = 8) after surgery. In 16 rats the vein graft was explanted after being in the arterial system for 4 weeks and was reimplanted as a venous-venous bypass in syngenic Lewis rats. Reimplanted vein grafts (RVGs) were explanted 2 weeks (n = 8) and 8 weeks (n = 8) later. Grafts were analyzed by light and electron microscopy, morphometry, and histochemistry, and were put in organ culture to assess PDGF and bFGF production and mitogenic activity.\nWe observed MH formation in AVGs and MH regression in RVGs (p < 0.001).PDGF and bFGF production correlated with the degree of MH (p < 0.01). Histochemistry showed PDGF and bFGF in the area of MH in AVG, which disappeared in RVG. Conditioned media from AVG had greater mitogenic activity than RVG or control veins.\nMH formation and regression in experimental vein grafts correlate with PDGF and bFGF production.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of our 6-year experience with directional atherectomy used for treatment of stenoses in infrainguinal vein grafts.\nFrom March 1988 to April 1994, 52 directional atherectomy procedures were undertaken in 42 patients to treat 67 stenoses in 44 vein grafts. Follow-up consisted of periodic physical examinations and graft surveillance; ankle/brachial indexes, pulse volume recordings, and color-flow duplex ultrasonography. Follow-up angiography (n = 18) was performed for recurrent symptoms, reproducible drop in ankle/brachial index of greater than 0.15, a twofold to threefold focal increase in peak systolic velocity, or incidentally during evaluation of the opposite leg.\nForty-nine of 52 (94%) procedures were technically successful. In two the residual diameter stenosis was greater than 30%, and in one atherectomy could not be performed. Complications were minor in six (11%) and major in three (6%): two acute graft occlusions and one delayed pseudoaneurysm at the atherectomy site. There were no deaths at 30 days. With a mean follow-up of 21 +/- 18 months, 36 of 44 grafts (82%) remained patent without restenosis; 6 others were patent but considered \"failed\"--5 (11%) with restenosis, 1 with a pseudoaneurysm; and 2 grafts (5%) occluded. Clinically 33 of 44 extremities (75%) were asymptomatic during follow-up. Claudication improved in five, recurred in three, and was unchanged in one. There was one below-knee amputation. Life-table analysis including all 52 procedures reveals cumulative primary atherectomy patency rates for the 44 grafts of 82%, 78%, and 78%, respectively, at 1, 2, and 3 years after atherectomy, and 86%, 83%, and 83% for the 67 individual stenoses treated.\nDirectional atherectomy of vein graft stenoses has high technical and clinical success rates, acceptably low morbidity rates, and offers better sustained patency rates than balloon angioplasty. Its long-term patency rate seems to approach that of surgical vein patch angioplasty.",

    "abstract": "This report describes the results of a phase 1 trial of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm, conducted under FDA protocol in 13 U.S. medical centers from February 1993 to December 1994.\nForty-six patients 54 to 84 years of age underwent endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (diameter, 3.8 to 7.1 cm). Fifteen were treated with the original device (EGS-I), and 31 with a revised over-the-wire system (EGS-II). All patients were periodically observed with contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan, color-flow duplex scan, and plain abdominal films to evaluate the stability of prosthetic location and to detect any vascular communication with or entry of blood into the aneurysm sac or change in aneurysm size.\nThirty-nine implants (85%) were successful; average operating time was 194 minutes. Seven attempts were unsuccessful and were converted to open repair without complication (EGS-I, 5 of 15; EGS-II, 2 of 31). Conversions were caused by iliac stenosis in four patients, subintimal deployment in one, proximal displacement in one, and short distal neck in one. No patients died within 30 days of surgery. Complications included myocardial infarction in one patient, iliofemoral arterial injury in eight, wound infection in seven, required transfusion in eight, transient unexplained fever in nine, and minor emboli with foot petechiae in two. There were no amputations, major emboli, or episodes of mesenteric ischemia. Contrast enhancement outside the graft but within the aneurysm sac was detected initially in 17 grafts (44%), of which nine (53%) resolved spontaneously. Of eight persistent leaks into the aneurysm sac, one was controlled with transluminal balloon angioplasty and one required surgical explanation because of aneurysm enlargement. Six patients continued to have contrast enhancement, but had no evidence of aneurysm enlargement from 6 to 27 months after surgery. Hospital stay averaged 3.8 days (range, 1 to 13 days). Follow-up extends to 27 months, with one non-device related death of respiratory failure at 6 months. Metallic attachment system fracture, a device-related malfunction, was identified in nine implants (23%), which led to one removal; the remaining eight functioned normally with no untoward sequelae. The program was suspended while the defect was corrected. Preparations are complete for the phase 2 portion of the trial.\nEndovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm appears to be safe and efficacious. Long-term results and late consequences of attachment system fracture have yet to be determined. The long-term results of perigraft leak into the aneurysm sac are unknown but worrisome in view of adverse outcomes reported by other investigators.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports suggest that 80% to 90% of patients can safely undergo carotid endarterectomy on the basis of duplex scanning alone without cerebral angiography. Other investigators have recommended that a complementary imaging study such as magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) also be obtained.\nWe prospectively evaluated 103 consecutive patients with carotid occlusive disease. Eighty percent of patients were symptomatic. All 103 patients underwent duplex scanning and arteriography. Additional noninvasive tests included computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and MRA in 50%, 56%, and 48% of patients, respectively. At a multispecialty conference all studies except angiograms were reviewed, and a treatment decision was made by a panel of attending vascular surgeons, neurosurgeons, and neurologists. The cerebral angiograms then were reviewed and changes made to final treatment plans were noted.\nAfter review of noninvasive studies, 30 of 103 of patients (29%) were believed to require arteriography because of diagnostic uncertainty of carotid occlusion in three patients, suggestion of nonatherosclerotic disease in four, suggestion of proximal disease in two, suboptimal noninvasive studies in one, and uncertainty of therapy despite good-quality noninvasive studies in 20 patients primarily with borderline stenoses and unclear symptoms. In 10 of these 30 patients (33%) management decisions were changed on the basis of angiogram results. Of the remaining 73 patients (71%) in whom the panel felt comfortable proceeding with operative or medical therapy without angiography, only one patient (1.4%) would have had management altered by results of angiography. MRA results concurred with duplex findings in 92% of studies, but did not alter management in any patient.\nIn patients with good-quality duplex images, focal atherosclerotic bifurcation disease, and clear clinical presentation, treatment decisions can be made without arteriography. In 30% of patients angiography is useful in clarifying decisionmaking. MRA is unlikely to influence management decisions and is thus rarely indicated.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to examine the role of the vascular endothelium in modulating arterial reactivity to adrenergic vasoconstriction in subcutaneous arteries from patients with type II diabetes.\nSmall subcutaneous arteries (inner diameter = 90 to 180 microns) from control subjects (n = 22) and patients with diabetes (n = 18) were dissected from skin biopsies obtained at surgery and mounted on a specialized arteriograph that allowed for continuous measurement of lumen diameter under controlled pressure. The sensitivity to norepinephrine was compared in arteries that were either intact, denuded of endothelium, or intact and exposed to N omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis. Stimulated release of nitric oxide by acetylcholine and smooth muscle cell responses to sodium nitroprusside were also evaluated in diabetic and control arteries.\nSensitivity to norepinephrine was augmented in diabetic arteries and the amount of agonist necessary to contract the vessels 50% of maximum (EC50) decreased from 0.35 +/- 0.05 mumol/L in the control arteries to 0.16 +/- 0.06 mumol/L in the diabetic arteries (p < 0.05). Both endothelial removal and blockade of nitric oxide synthesis increased sensitivity to norepinephrine in control arteries (EC50 denuded = 0.14 +/- 0.03 mumol/L and EC50 L-NNA = 0.14 +/- 0.04 mumol/L; p < 0.01) but failed to augment sensitivity in diabetic arteries (EC50 denuded = 0.17 +/- 0.05 mumol/L and EC50 L-NNA = 0.15 +/- 0.04 mumol/L; p > 0.05). Stimulated release of nitric oxide by acetylcholine was increased in the diabetic arteries: EC50 control = 0.04 +/- 0.01 mumol/L versus EC50 diabetic = 0.009 +/- 0.001 mumol/L (p < 0.05). Sensitivity of vascular smooth muscle to sodium nitroprusside was similar in both nondiabetic and diabetic arteries.\nThe endothelium mitigates adrenergic reactivity in control arteries, which is lacking in diabetic arteries and results in enhanced reactivity to norepinephrine; increased sensitivity of diabetic arteries to acetylcholine, however, indicates a possible alteration at the receptor level.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzes the role of the carotid endarterectomy (CEA)-produced common carotid step or shelf on early and late CEA outcome. A simple method of reconstruction that covers the exposed media and intima of the step and smooths out the flow channel is presented.\nSince 1984 intraoperative geometric measurements were made on 1019 CEA. Duplex scans were made after surgery on 968 (95%); 234 (23%) were monitored for at least 5 years. Of the first 920 CEA, 261 (28%) had a step > or = 2 mm. Of the last 99 operations, the 27 (27%) with a step > or = 2 mm had inversion plication reconstruction of the step.\nThree patients had early post-CEA neurologic events attributed to a common carotid step, two had transient ischemic attacks, and one had a mild stroke. All three had a CEA-produced step > or = 2 mm (1.2% of 261, p = 0.03 when compared with no unexplained early neurologic events in the 659 without a step). Duplex scans were normal in all three except for a common carotid artery step. Six patients had seven reoperations for common carotid artery restenosis at 23 to 104 months (mean 73 months) after CEA. All had a step > or = 2 mm at the origin CEA (2.7% of 261, p = 0.001 when compared with no reoperations for common carotid artery stenosis in the 659 CEA without a step). All but one patient had > 75% restenosis. Four were asymptomatic. All seven with restenosis were within 2 mm of the original common carotid end point step. Four restenoses were concentric, two eccentric, and one ulcerated. Six of the seven arteries were originally reconstructed with a greater saphenous vein patch that extended 3 to 6 mm proximal to the step. Early postoperative duplex scans of the 27 recent CEA with step reconstruction demonstrated a tortuous but smooth common carotid artery flow channel.\nThe CEA-produced common carotid artery step is a potential source of both early postoperative emboli and late restenosis. The incidence is approximately 4% in patients with a CEA step > or = 2 mm. CEA vein patch reconstruction does not prevent restenosis in the region of the step but may lower the incidence. Although not proven, reconstruction techniques directed at covering the exposed step media and intima and smoothing the flow channel may favorably alter outcome.",

    "abstract": "The way American medicine is practiced is changing rapidly. By the beginning of the next century, most Americans may be enrolled in for-profit managed care plans in which physicians are responsible for both a budget and a population of patients. As health care is revolutionized, the overriding issue is whether the mission of health care organizations will be simply to contain costs, or whether it will be to increase the value (i.e., the quality) that we get for the money we are willing to spend on health care. The purpose of this article is to illustrate for carotid endarterectomy how quality can remain on the health care reform agenda. Vascular surgeons must assume a leadership role, and they must be willing to alter their practice patterns. More specifically, they should: (1) support and facilitate the development of clinically-detailed multispecialty criteria that describe under what circumstances carotid endarterectomy is both appropriate and necessary; (2) support the development of a system for publicly reporting outcome data by physician and hospital; (3) support regionalization of carotid endarterectomy; (4) conduct a prospective assessment of appropriateness before the procedure is performed; (5) consider changing the system by which carotid angiographies are read to increase their reliability; and (6) help develop a system to ensure that people who need carotid endarterectomy are offered the procedure.",

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for venous duplex scans despite the relative rarity of detecting acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prompted us to review our experience with this diagnostic method.\nWe retrospectively analyzed the results and indications of 2993 lower extremity venous duplex scans performed between July 1, 1992, and June 30, 1994, at our institution. The indication for the study and the results were prospectively recorded in a computerized data bank. The indications for these studies were leg pain (34%), leg swelling (24%), surveillance for DVT in a patient at high risk (23%), searching for a source of pulmonary embolism (14%), follow-up of previously diagnosed DVT (3%), and other indications (i.e., varicose veins, venous ulcer, 2%).\nOverall, 74.1% of all scans were completely normal, and only 13.1% detected acute proximal (popliteal vein or higher) DVT. Scans performed for surveillance (87.3% normal) or source of pulmonary embolism (79.6% normal) were significantly more likely to be normal than when performed for any other indication (p < 0.01). When leg edema or calf tenderness was present, the incidence of acute DVT was significantly greater for all indications (p < 0.0001).\nThe high percentage of normal venous scans implies that this diagnostic method is being inappropriately used. In the current climate of cost containment our data suggest that indications for venous duplex scans must be better defined and that improved education for referring physicians is needed.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether gender distinction influence the cardiac risk or survival rates associated with surgical treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).\nFrom 1983 to 1988, graft replacement of intact AAAs was performed in 490 men (84%) and in 92 women (16%) who had no history of myocardial revascularization before the discovery of their AAAs. Patients of both genders were comparable with respect to mean age (68 years) and the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) by standard clinical criteria (men, 73%; women, 65%). Preoperative coronary angiography was obtained in 471 of the 582 patients (men, 81%; women, 80%) during this particular study period. Preliminary coronary bypass was warranted on the basis of existing indications in 111 (24%) of these 471 patients (men, 25%; women, 18%), including 104 (31%) of the 337 who had clinical indications of CAD (men, 32%; women, 26%) but only 7 (5.2%) of the 134 who did not (men, 6%; women, 4%). Follow-up data were collected during a mean interval of 53 months (men, 54 months; women, 48 months) and were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models.\nTwenty-nine perioperative deaths (5.0%) occurred in conjunction with AAA repair (men, 5.1%; women, 4.3%), and 126 early and late deaths have occurred (men, 22%; women, 22%). Survival rates for the series were found to correlate with age (p < 0.001), the serum creatinine level (p < 0.001), and the coronary angiographic classification (p < 0.001). No significant differences were identified between the gender cohorts. The cardiac mortality rate for AAA resection was only 1.8% in the 111 patients who had preliminary coronary bypass, but five additional perioperative deaths (4.5%) related to renal failure or sepsis occurred in this group. However, 5-year survival rates for patients receiving preliminary bypass (men, 82%; women, 75%) were closely comparable with those for patients found to have only mild to moderate CAD by angiography (men, 86%; women, 82%).\nWe conclude that men and women with AAAs have similar cardiac risks and survival rates associated with surgical treatment. Our results also illustrate that the potential benefit of coronary intervention for severe CAD in patients of either gender must be considered in the context of long-term outcome and the early mortality rate of AAA repair.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to identify significant differences in the clinical and radiologic characteristics and outcome between patients with inflammatory and noninflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).\nWe reviewed 29 consecutive patients who underwent repair of an inflammatory AAA between 1985 and 1994. This group was matched in a case-control fashion by date of surgery and by the performing surgeon to a group of 58 patients who underwent repair of noninflammatory AAAs.\nThe two groups had comparable characteristics of age, gender, and cardiovascular risk factors. Patients with inflammatory AAAs were significantly more symptomatic than those with noninflammatory AAAs (93% vs 9%, p < 0.001), were more likely to have a family history of aneurysms (17% vs 1.5%, p = 0.007), and tended to be current smokers (45% vs 24%, p = 0.049). The most significant laboratory difference was an elevated sedimentation rate in patients with inflammatory AAAs (mean, 53 mm/hr vs 12 mm/hr, p < 0.00001). Inflammatory AAAs also were significantly larger than noninflammatory AAAs at presentation (6.8 cm vs 5.9 cm, p < 0.05). Although operative mortality was low in both groups, patients with an inflammatory AAA tended to have higher morbidity, including sepsis (p < 0.01) and renal failure (p = 0.04). Five-year survival rates, however, were similar for the two groups (79% for inflammatory and 83% for noninflammatory AAAs). On follow-up computed tomographic scans, the retroperitoneal inflammatory process resolved completely in 53% of the patients, but 47% of patients had persistent inflammation that involved the ureters in 32% and resulted in long-term solitary or bilateral renal atrophy in 47%.\nThis case-control study provides preliminary evidence that inflammatory AAAs may have a relatively strong familial connection and that current smoking may play an important role in the inflammatory response. The study also documents that persistent retroperitoneal inflammation may be more prevalent than has been previously reported, and stresses the need for an improved understanding of the pathogenesis and long-term management of inflammatory AAAs.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacologic lysis or balloon thrombectomy are options to treat acute arterial thrombosis; however, little is known about their effects on functional changes in the arterial wall. The aim of this study was to determine function of the endothelium and smooth muscle in canine arteries revascularized after acute thrombosis with balloon thrombectomy or lytic therapy.\nAcute thrombosis was obtained by bilateral proximal and distal ligation of 8-cm. segments of the femoral arteries in dogs. After 24 hours, the ties were removed and the arteries randomized to treatment groups: group 1, balloon thrombectomy (# 4 Fogarty balloon catheter at 60 grams linear shear x 1 pass, n = 7); group 2, untreated, tie removal only (n = 6); group 3, regional intra-arterial urokinase infusion (4000 U/min x 90 min, n = 6); group 4, regional intra-arterial carrier infusion (0.43 ml/min x 90 min, n = 6); group 5, unoperated normal vessels (n = 5). After treatment, the arteries were removed and endothelial and smooth muscle responses examined in organ chambers. Endothelial loss was graded with light microscopy of vessel rings from each animal by an observer blinded to the treatment group. Findings were confirmed with scanning electron microscopy.\nTreatment with urokinase did not alter endothelium-dependent relaxations or smooth muscle contractions compared with carrier infusion or untreated alone. Balloon catheter thrombectomy significantly reduced endothelium-dependent relaxations compared with all other groups in response to acetylcholine, bradykinin, and thrombin (p < 0.001). Contractions of smooth muscle in response to potassium chloride (60 mol/L) and phenylephrine (1 x 10-6 mol/L) were also reduced (p < 0.05). Rings from balloon thrombectomized arteries contracted in response to calcium ionophore A23187 (p < 0.001); these contractions were endothelium dependent and not reduced by indomethacin or blockade of endothelin A and B receptors. No significant differences in percentage of endothelial coverage between groups were assessed by light and electron microscopy.\nThrombolysis with urokinase caused no or minimal abnormalities in endothelial and smooth muscle function. Endothelium present after balloon thrombectomy produces contractile factors. Although the duration and recovery of these abnormalities in function are unknown, these findings support preferential use of urokinase over balloon thrombectomy when possible in acute arterial thrombosis or embolism.",

In patients who have neurologic deficits prompt surgical exploration of the puncture site with decompression of the involved nerve(s) may reduce the incidence of prolonged deficits.",

Two patients with HIT who received enoxaparin after aggregation testing demonstrated no cross-reactivity to enoxaparin achieved adequate anticoagulation and did not develop HIT.",

    "abstract": "Although animal models have been used to characterize the relation between oxygen consumption and blood flow, reliable data have not been generated in the human small intestine. We perfused segments of human small intestine by using an ex vivo perfusion circuit that allowed precise manipulation of blood flow and perfusion pressure. Our goal was to define the critical level of intestinal blood flow necessary to maintain the metabolic needs of the tissue. Human small intestine (n = 5) tissue obtained at transplantation harvest was transported on ice to the laboratory. A 40-cm mid-jejunal segment was selected for perfusion, and appropriate inflow and outflow vessels were identified and cannulated. Perfusion with an autologous blood solution was initiated through an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit. After a 30-minute equilibration period, arterial and venous blood gases were measured at varying flow rates while maintaining a constant hematocrit level. Arterial and venous oxygen content, arteriovenous oxygen difference (A-VO2 diff), and oxygen consumption (VO2) were then calculated. Our results demonstrated that at blood flows > 30 ml/min/100 g, VO2 is independent of blood flow (1.6 +/- 0.06 ml/min/100 g), and oxygen extraction is inversely related to flow. Below this blood flow rate of 30 ml/min/100 g, oxygen extraction does not increase further (6.3 +/- 0.3 vol%), and VO2 becomes flow dependent. This ex vivo preparation defines for the first time a threshold value of blood flow for small intestine below which oxygen consumption decreases (30 ml/min/100 g). Previous animal studies have correlated such a decrease in oxygen consumption with functional and histologic evidence of tissue injury. This \"critical\" flow rate in human intestine is similar to that found previously in canine and feline intestine, but lower than that of rodent species.",

    "abstract": "We studied the impact of an endoluminally placed stented aortic graft on the geometry of a surgically created abdominal aortic dilation (AAD) in nonatherosclerotic mongrel dogs. Patulous iliac vein patch infrarenal aortoplasty produced a fusiform AAD, doubling the aorta diameter. Lumbar and mesenteric aortic tributaries were preserved and no mural thrombus formed. AADs created in 23 dogs were endoluminally excluded through transfemoral placement of a thin-wall Dacron graft 4 +/- 2 months later. Balloon-expandable stents were used to anchor each end of the graft to the aorta. The graft was crimped radially in its body and longitudinally at its ends to provide longitudinal and radial expandability in these respective zones. Serial color duplex, angiography, and direct caliper measurements were made. Before graft placement, a 19% +/- 11% diameter growth was observed. At graft placement, flow arrest immediately occurred in the space between the graft and the AAD intima in all cases. Although microscopic recanalization of the thrombus in this space was seen at sacrifice 6 and 12 months later, no macroscopic duplex flow was imaged. A 10% +/- 11% reduction in AAD diameter was measured at 6 months (p < 0.001), with no further reduction at 12 months. Graft dimensions remained stable. No anastomotic leaks developed. AAD growth stopped during the first year after effective endoluminal exclusion in normotensive dogs despite patent side branches (< 1.5 mm internal diameter) and no mural thrombus at the time of graft placement. Whether microscopic recanalization of the thrombus that forms outside the graft has an impact after 1 year remains to be seen.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the value of preoperative cardiac screening with dipyridamole thallium scintigraphy and radionuclide ventriculography in vascular surgery patients.\nFrom July 1, 1989, to Dec. 31, 1991, we routinely (irrespective of the patient's cardiac history or symptomatology) performed dipyridamole thallium scintigraphy (DTS) and radionuclide ventriculography (RVG) in 394 patients being considered for an elective vascular operation. Patients with reversible defects on DTS underwent coronary arteriography.\nDTS results were normal in 146 patients (37%), showed a fixed defect in 75 (19%), and showed a reversible defect in 173 (44%). Patients with and without a history of angina or myocardial infarction had identical rates of reversible defects. Normal left ventricular function (> 50%) was noted in 76% of the patients; 17% had moderate dysfunction (35% to 50%) and 7% had a low ejection fraction (< 35%). The finding of severe coronary artery disease led to cardiac revascularization in 17 patients who had no prior history of cardiac disease and in 13 patients with a history of angina or myocardial infarction. Two deaths and nine major complications were associated with coronary arteriography and cardiac revascularization. Vascular procedures (144 aortic, 53 carotid, 146 infrainguinal) were ultimately performed in 343 patients, with a mortality rate of 1.7% (3.5% aortic, 0% carotid, and 0.7% infrainguinal bypass). The nonfatal perioperative myocardial infarction rate was 2.0%. We monitored all 394 patients for cardiovascular events, with a mean follow-up of 40 months. Patients who underwent cardiac revascularization had a 4-year survival rate of 75%, which was similar to those with a normal DTS. Late cardiac events were significantly more frequent in patients who had either a reversible DTS or RVG < 35%.\nRoutine cardiac screening of vascular surgery patients had similar impact on patients irrespective of their prior history or current symptoms suggesting coronary artery disease. Routine screening did not result in substantial benefit. Screening studies such as DTS or RVG may be most useful as part of an overall risk versus benefit assessment in patients without active symptoms of coronary artery disease who have less compelling indications for vascular intervention (claudication, moderate-sized aortic aneurysms, or asymptomatic carotid disease).",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to determine whether magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) will allow preoperative management decisions without the need for contrast arteriography in patients with lower extremity ischemia caused by infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease.\nForty-five patients with lower extremity ischemia in 50 limbs were evaluated by both two-dimensional time-of-flight MRA and intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) between February 1992 and June 1995. Independent management plans were based on clinical presentation, pulse volume recordings, and separate reviews of the MRA and DSA.\nOf 50 limbs, 23 required arterial bypass, 19 percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, 5 patch angioplasty, and 3 amputation. MRA and DSA correlated exactly in 89.5% of infrainguinal arterial segments, whereas interpretations disagreed in 10.5% of arterial segments. Mismatches that had an influence on patient treatment decisions occurred in only 8 (2.3%) of 352 arterial segments. Independent MRA- and DSA-based revascularization plans agreed in 45 (90%) extremities. MRA predicted the level of arterial reconstruction in all 23 limbs that required arterial bypass. MRA identified focal stenoses amenable to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in 18 (94.7%) of the 19 limbs that ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. A strategy of preoperative planning by MRA with confirmatory intraoperative arteriography would represent a 31% cost savings per patient at our institution while eliminating the morbidity of preoperative DSA.\nWhen used in combination with the patient's physical examination and segmental limb pressures with plethysmography, MRA is sufficient for planning infrainguinal arterial bypass procedures and selecting patients for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.",

MRA and DSA correlated exactly in 89.5% of infrainguinal arterial segments, whereas interpretations disagreed in 10.5% of arterial segments. Mismatches that had an influence on patient treatment decisions occurred in only 8 (2.3%) of 352 arterial segments. Independent MRA- and DSA-based revascularization plans agreed in 45 (90%) extremities. MRA predicted the level of arterial reconstruction in all 23 limbs that required arterial bypass. MRA identified focal stenoses amenable to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in 18 (94.7%) of the 19 limbs that ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. A strategy of preoperative planning by MRA with confirmatory intraoperative arteriography would represent a 31% cost savings per patient at our institution while eliminating the morbidity of preoperative DSA.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and proliferation are prominent features of intimal hyperplasia. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of c-myb inhibits arterial SMC proliferation. Our goal was to evaluate the effect of an antisense oligonucleotide targeted to c-myb on the proliferation and migration of SMC explanted from synthetic vascular grafts.\nSMCs were enzymatically removed from aortas and Dacron grafts explanted from dogs (n = 5). For proliferation studies, quiescent SMCs were incubated with either 0.0, 0.5, 5.0, or 10.0 microM antisense (GTGTCGGGGTCTCCGGGC) or sense (GCCCGGAGACCCCGACAC) oligonucleotides to c-myb. Proliferation was measured after 24 hours by incorporation of [3H]thymidine. Migration was assessed 24 hours after a razor injury.\nAntisense to c-myb consistently inhibited proliferation and migration of both native aortic and graft SMCs in a dose-dependent fashion. At a concentration of 10 microM antisense oligonucleotide, aortic and graft SMC proliferation rates were 32% +/- 20% and 56% +/- 9% of control samples, respectively. At 25 microM antisense, the number of migrating aortic and graft SMCs decreased to 41.9% +/- 26.8% and 51.9% +/- 34.1% of control samples, respectively.\nOur results suggest that antisense oligonucleotides to c-myb may be useful in the inhibition of SMC proliferation and migration associated with development of intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Many patients who have advanced cancer of the neck will have involvement of the internal carotid artery. The management of this condition remains controversial, and a wide range of therapeutic options have been suggested including ligation, \"shaving\" the tumor off the carotid, or en bloc resection and replacement of the internal carotid artery by polytetrafluoroethylene, vein, or superficial femoral artery. We reviewed our experience with en bloc resections of the internal carotid artery in a consecutive series of patients who had malignancies involving the internal carotid artery at a single institution from 1989 to 1995.\nWe used a retrospective chart review based on a list of 20 patients generated by the Hospital Cancer Registry and our Vascular Surgery clinical database.\nAll patients had their internal carotid artery removed and replaced with a greater saphenous vein while they were under general anesthesia. A resection of their cervical malignancy was also performed. Concomitant myocutaneous flaps were rotated over the carotid bypass in six (30%) patients. Eight (40%) of the bypass grafts were nonreversed, and 12(60%) were reversed, with a clear trend towards using nonreversed veins more recently. Shunts were used in 18(90%). Eighteen of the 20 patients had some form of intraoperative contamination including tracheostomies, pharyngostomies, or fistulas. Half of the patients had intraoperative radiation therapy, and 16(80%) patients underwent operation for recurrent cancer. During the follow-up period two (10%) patients had strokes (one minor and one major), and one patient had a graft blowout, which was treated by ligation without stroke. One patient had an asymptomatic occlusion of his graft.\nFrom these results we conclude that the use of the greater saphenous vein to replace the internal carotid artery after en bloc resection is not attended by a high rate of infectious complications or graft blowout even in the presence of intraoperative tracheopharyngeal contamination and that the greater saphenous vein is the conduit of choice for replacing an internal carotid artery after cancer resections.",

    "abstract": "Depending on the derivation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) has variable effects on proliferation and expression of extracellular matrix. Relatively little is known about TGF-beta 1's effects on human arterial SMC. Therefore, we sought to determine the effects of TGF-beta 1 on human arterial SMC proliferation and 1 alpha(I) procollagen expression. The mechanisms by which TGF-beta 1 regulate type I procollagen expression were also investigated.\nSMC cultures were established from the aorta of transplant donors. Serial doses of TGF-beta 1 were applied, and cellular proliferation assessed by cell counting and tritiated thymidine incorporation. Total cellular ribonucleic acid (RNA) was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot for changes in 1 alpha(I) procollagen and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A transcripts.\nIn a dose-dependent manner, TGF-beta 1 inhibited SMC proliferation despite early induction of PDGF-A mRNA. After a delay of 24 hours, TGF-beta 1 increased 1 alpha(I) procollagen expression by 36% compared with control. PDGF-neutralizing antibodies blocked the TGF-beta 1-mediated upregulation of type I procollagen, although PDGF alone had no effect on matrix expression.\nThe results indicate that TGF-beta 1 is a potent inhibitor of human arterial SMC proliferation that has a moderate effect on 1 alpha(I) procollagen transcripts. Despite inducing PDGF-A gene expression, TGF-beta 1 is not a mitogen in adult human arterial SMC. TGF-beta 1 regulates SMC type I procollagen expression partly by inducing PDGF-A as a co-factor.",

    "abstract": "Plaque rupture is often the precipitating event in acute coronary syndromes. We hypothesized that a similar process occurs in stenotic carotid plaques in association with ischemic neurologic symptoms. Our purpose was to examine several morphologic features of stenotic carotid plaques and to determine which characteristics are more commonly associated with plaques obtained from patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease than with those from patients with asymptomatic carotid artery disease.\nForty-four carotid endarterectomy specimens (from 25 asymptomatic and 19 symptomatic patients) were analyzed with pentachrome staining and light microscopy. The asymptomatic patients and symptomatic patients had similar mean percent stenosis (77% vs 74%). Other risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, smoking history, serum cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, were similar between groups.\nPatients with symptomatic carotid artery disease were found to have more frequent plaque rupture, fibrous cap thinning, and fibrous cap foam-cell infiltration when compared with the asymptomatic group. Plaque rupture was seen in 74% of symptomatic plaques and in only 32% of plaques from asymptomatic patients (p = 0.004). Fibrous cap thinning was noted in 95% of symptomatic plaques and in 48% of asymptomatic plaques (p = 0.003). Infiltration of the fibrous cap with foam cells was also significantly more common in the symptomatic plaques (84% vs 44% of asymptomatic plaques; p = 0.006). In addition, intraplaque fibrin was more common in symptomatic plaques than in asymptomatic (100% vs 68%; p = 0.008). No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to plaque hemorrhage, the presence of a necrotic core, luminal thrombus, smooth muscle cell infiltration, eccentric shape, and plaque type (fibrous, necrotic, or calcified).\nAs in the coronary artery system, rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke caused by carotid artery stenosis. The process of inflammation, involving foam-cell infiltration of the fibrous cap, may contribute to rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque.",

Between 1984 and 1993, 619 consecutive CEAs were performed in 587 patients.\nRecurrent carotid stenosis developed in 48 CEA sites (7.8%) during a mean follow-up interval of 34 months (range, 2 to 118 months). Normal results on intraoperative assessment correlated with a 5.6% incidence of recurrent stenosis, compared with a 19% incidence when a residual hemodynamic abnormality was present (p < 0.0003). In the first year after surgery, there were no transient ischemic attacks, strokes, or carotid occlusions from recurrent stenosis, compared with a 27% morbidity rate in later follow-up (p < 0.01). Three patients with recurrent stenosis subsequently had occlusion at the CEA site, two of whom had severe ipsilateral strokes.\nThe incidence of recurrent carotid stenosis is low. Patients are at significant risk for neurologic morbidity when a recurrent stenosis occludes. With a 0.3% incidence of late stroke resulting from carotid bifurcation disease, these data confirm that CEA does provide long-term protection from stroke.",

    "abstract": "Aortic blebs-focal outpouchings within aortic aneurysms-may contribute to their eventual rupture. In this study we determine the incidence of aortic blebs and describe their microscopic features.\nComputed tomographic scans of the abdominal aorta were obtained in 188 patients with aortic diameters measuring > or = 3 cm and were independently evaluated by a radiologist. The number and location of blebs were recorded, and each was measured with calipers. Sixteen blebs, with an adjacent uninvolved aneurysmal segment of aorta, and tissue from two patients with ruptured aneurysms were examined by light microscopy and immunohistochemical analysis. Specimens from six blebs and five aneurysms were examined for alpha 1 (I) procollagen messenger RNA by in situ hybridization.\nTwenty blebs, ranging in size from 5 to 30 mm (mean, 12 +/- 7 mm), were detected in 11% (20 of 188) of computed tomographic scans. Blebs were observed in 10% (11 of 111) of patients with aortic diameters between 3.0 and 4.9 cm, 10% (6 of 61) of patients with aneurysms between 5.0 and 6.9 cm, and 19% (3 of 16) of patients with aortic diameters > or = 7 cm. Histologically, the major difference between the aneurysmal aortic wall and blebs was found in the media. In aneurysmal aortas, the media consisted of multiple layers of fragmented elastic lamellae, whereas the number of elastic tissue elements along the circumference of the blebs progressively decreased; only a few isolated fragments of elastic tissue were present at the apices. Histologic evidence of rupture was evident in two specimens. A chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate composed of T and B lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages, common to both the aneurysmal and the blebs, was most prominent in the adventitia of aneurysmal tissue, but involved both the media and adventitia of the blebs. In situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of alpha 1 (I) procollagen messenger RNA in four of the five aneurysm segments that were evaluated, compared with only one of six blebs.\nBlebs were discovered in aneurysms of all sizes; their frequency appeared to be unrelated to aneurysm size. The presence of inflammatory cell infiltrates and absence of alpha 1 (I) procollagen messenger RNA in five of six blebs suggest that a local imbalance of matrix degradation and repair plays a role in the cause of these lesions. Attenuation of the aortic wall accompanying the formation of blebs may predispose these sites to rupture.",

Blebs were observed in 10% (11 of 111) of patients with aortic diameters between 3.0 and 4.9 cm, 10% (6 of 61) of patients with aneurysms between 5.0 and 6.9 cm, and 19% (3 of 16) of patients with aortic diameters > or = 7 cm. Histologically, the major difference between the aneurysmal aortic wall and blebs was found in the media. In aneurysmal aortas, the media consisted of multiple layers of fragmented elastic lamellae, whereas the number of elastic tissue elements along the circumference of the blebs progressively decreased; only a few isolated fragments of elastic tissue were present at the apices. Histologic evidence of rupture was evident in two specimens. A chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate composed of T and B lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages, common to both the aneurysmal and the blebs, was most prominent in the adventitia of aneurysmal tissue, but involved both the media and adventitia of the blebs. In situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of alpha 1 (I) procollagen messenger RNA in four of the five aneurysm segments that were evaluated, compared with only one of six blebs.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to identify the metalloproteinases elaborated by medial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) isolated from abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and control arterial tissues and to ascertain if the levels produced by AAA SMCs were elevated.\nSMC monolayers cultured from the outgrowth cells of tunica media explants were established, and their identity was determined by fluorescent microscopy by using a fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated anti-SMC alpha-actin antibody. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) produced by SMC monolayers in serum-free culture were examined by gelatin zymography and Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies to MMP-2, 3, and 9.\nSerum-free media from AAA SMCs contained metal-dependent elastolytic activity that cleaved the synthetic substrate succinyl trialanyl 4-nitroanilide (pH optima 7.2) and also 14C-insoluble elastin. The level of proteolytic activity found in these cultures was significantly greater than from control SMC media. Zymography established that AAA SMC media samples contained metal-dependent gelatinases of 50 to 64 and 92 kDa, which were identified respectively as MMP-2 and 9 by Western blotting by using monoclonal antibodies to these proteases.\nMedial SMCs isolated from AAA tissue produce significantly higher levels of MMP-9 and 2 than SMCs from control arterial tissues. These proteinases have the capacity to degrade elastin and a range of extracellular matrix proteins. From these data, we suggest SMCs may be involved in the abnormal degradation of the aortic wall in AAA through the excessive metalloproteinase activity produced by SMCs.",

    "abstract": "Although management of extensive type I and II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAA) remains a formidable challenge, results of repair of TAA originating in the distal thoracic aorta (type IV) appear to have improved significantly. To quantitate this perceived improvement, the following retrospective study was undertaken to examine the results of type IV TAA repair at the Brigham & Women's Hospital over the past 18-year period.\nFrom July 1977 to September 1994, nonruptured atherosclerotic type IV TAAs were repaired in 58 patients. The mean age was 70 years, and associated risk factors included smoking (91%), hypertension (86%), coronary artery disease (52%), and previous aortic surgery (38%). Mean follow-up was 2.4 years (median 2 years).\nOverall 30-day mortality was 5.3% (two deaths). Morbidity included stroke (3.5%), paraplegia (1.8%), permanent paraparesis (1.8%), myocardial infarction (7%), pneumonia (8.8%), gastrointestinal bleeding (11%), intestinal ischemia (5.3%), wound infection (7.0%), peripheral ischemia (5.3%), in-hospital dialysis (8.8%), and permanent dialysis (1.9%). Overall 5-year survival was 50%. With univariate analysis, survival was positively correlated with more recent year of operation (p = 0.002), smaller volume of intraoperative blood transfusion (p = 0.02), decreased supraceliac ischemia time (p = 0.04), and the use of the retroperitoneal approach (p = 0.09). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the year of operation was the only independent predictor of survival (p = 0.003). Subgroup analysis of patients who underwent operation between 1977 and 1987 (n = 13) and 1988 and 1994 (n = 45) revealed statistically significant improvements in length of hospital stay (46 +/- 12 vs 21 +/- 4 days, p = 0.02), postoperative dysrhythmia (50% vs 16%, p = 0.03), postoperative maximum serum glutamic oxaloacetic-transaminase (516 +/- 234 vs 319 +/- 139 mg%, p = 0.04), incidence of hemorrhage requiring reexploration (33% vs 0%, p = 0.002), 30-day mortality (23% vs 0%, p = 0.009), and in-hospital mortality (39% vs 2.2%, p = 0.002).\nThe modern mortality, morbidity, and survival of surgical repair of type IV TAA in our institution approaches that of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.",

    "abstract": "Although patency data for lower extremity bypass grafts are readily available, few reports have focused on patients' satisfaction after surgical reconstruction for claudication. We reviewed our experience with surgical treatment for claudication, focusing on late outcome from the patients' perspective to further refine surgical decision making in patients with intermittent claudication.\nFrom February 1987 through April 1994, 114 consecutive patients underwent surgical bypass for intermittent claudication. Nine patients were lost to follow-up, leaving the study cohort composed of 105 patients with a mean age of 63 years (range 42 to 82 years). Sixty-two percent of the procedures were inflow reconstructions, and the remainder were infrainguinal bypasses. Clinical and demographic data were gathered from record review, and late follow-up was obtained by return visit or telephone interview. Patient satisfaction and level of function were assessed by a simple five-point questionnaire administered by a research nurse. Actuarial methods were used to calculate late graft patency and survival. Cox regression analysis was used to identify clinical and anatomic factors predictive of late survival and favorable outcome.\nCardiac risk assessment revealed that 75% of patients either had no clinical markers for cardiac disease or had been treated with previous coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; despite this 61% of patients underwent specific preoperative cardiac testing. Most (68%) inflow procedures were aortobifemoral bypass grafts, and 93% of outflow procedures were femoropopliteal bypass grafts. Two thirds of infrainguinal grafts were performed with autogenous conduits, with prosthetic femoropopliteal bypass grafts performed only to the above-knee popliteal artery. Early graft failure with successful immediate revision occurred in 5% of patients. No operative deaths or early or late amputations occurred. At a mean follow-up of 4.5 years 96% of surviving patients had a patent graft. However, primary unassisted patency at 4 years was superior for inflow (92% +/- 4%) versus outflow (81% +/- 6%) procedures (p = 0.009). Late readmission for cardiac-related events occurred in 12%, and late cardiac-related death occurred in 5%. Actuarial survival at 5 years was 80% +/- 5%, with diabetes being the only negative survival predictor (risk ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval 1 to 7, p = 0.049); 60% of late deaths were cancer-related. Satisfactory late results were reported by 82% of patients, with age < or = 70 years (odds ratio 4.01, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 13.7, p = 0.026) and normalization ( > or = 0.85) of ankle/brachial index (odds ratio 5.7, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 20, p = 0.008) being powerful independent predictors of patient satisfaction.\nAfter considering cardiac-related short- and long-term prognosis, we conclude that lower extremity bypass grafting for intermittent claudication will produce optimal results when restricted to younger ( < 70 years) nondiabetic patients in whom near normalization of the postoperative ankle/brachial index can be anticipated.",

    "abstract": "Although severe, circumferential calcification of distal outflow vessels is frequently encountered, its effect on bypass graft patency rates has not been well established.\nUsing a computerized vascular registry database, we conducted a retrospective review of 1957 bypass grafts with distal anastomoses to infrapopliteal vessels performed at a single institution between 1990 and 1995. Of these cases, 101 procedures involved outflow arteries classified by the operating surgeon as severely calcified and unclampable (requiring intraluminal occluders for vascular control), whereas in 105 cases the outflow arteries had no calcification present at the distal anastomotic site. The remaining cases had varying intermediate degrees of calcification and were not analyzed. Indication for bypass procedure was limb-threatening ischemia in 90% of severe calcification cases and in 84% of cases without calcification. Atherosclerotic risk factors were similar except for the presence of diabetes (92% vs 74%, p < 0.001), creatinine level > 2.0 mg/dl (21% vs 8%, p < 0.01), and dialysis dependency (17% vs 3%, p < 0.001), all of which were more prevalent in the severe calcification group. Infrapopliteal distal anastomotic location and type of conduit ( > 90% autogenous vein) were comparable between groups.\nPrimary patency, secondary patency, and foot salvage rates at 24 months were 60%, 65%, and 77% for the severe calcification group and 74%, 82%, and 93% for the no calcification group, respectively. With secondary procedures comprising 26% of cases in each group, data from the 150 primary procedures were reanalyzed separately. In this primary procedure group, 24-month primary patency, secondary patency, and foot salvage rates were 66%, 69%, and 77% for the severe calcification group and 84%, 90%, and 96% for the no calcification group, respectively. Although patency and salvage rates were consistently lower for the severe calcification group in all analyses, these differences did not achieve significance by log-rank life-table analysis at 2-year follow-up. Perioperative 30-day mortality (0.99% severe calcification vs 0.95% no calcification) and 24-month survival rates (84% severe calcification vs 83% no calcification) were also similar between groups.\nThese data suggest that effective techniques exist to perform infrapopliteal bypasses to severely calcified, unclampable outflow arteries with results comparable with those obtained with clampable, uncalcified vessels. The finding of severe, circumferential calcification of outflow target arteries should not dissuade vascular surgeons from distal bypass for limb salvage indications.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to examine the outcome of simultaneous coronary bypass-carotid endarterectomy (CABG-CEA) and to compare it with the outcome of endarterectomy alone (CEA alone) in patients at high cardiac risk.\nA retrospective review of the records and follow-up data for 100 consecutive patients who had undergone CABG-CEA and were at high risk and 114 patients who had undergone CEA, had overt coronary artery disease (angina, previous infarct, or ischemic electrocardiographic abnormalities), but had not undergone CABG was carried out.\nOur CABG-CEA group had a high incidence of symptomatic carotid disease (57%) and contralateral occlusion (28%) when compared with patients in other reports. Patients in the CABG-CEA group were older (67.9 +/- 8.3 years vs 63.6 +/- 15.7 years, p = 0.01) and more often smokers (81% vs 52.6%, p = 0.01) than patients in the CEA alone group. Perioperative mortality was 8% for the CEA-CABG group and for 1.8% for the CEA alone group (p = 0.035). Perioperative stroke morbidity was 9% for the CEA-CABG group and 2.6% for the CEA alone group (p = 0.05). Life table survival at 1,3, and 5 years was 90%, 82%, and 73% versus 96%, 84%, and 76% for the CABG-CEA and CEA alone groups, respectively (p = 0.30).\nSelection criteria for CABG-CEA greatly influence perioperative risk. Despite the greater age and more advanced coronary artery disease in the CABG-CEA group, long-term outcome differences are accounted for entirely by differences in perioperative morbidity and mortality. Prospective trials of strategies such as staged CEA and CABG to reduce perioperative risk are needed.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration is a critical element in the development of intimal hyperplasia. The effect of endothelial cells (ECs) on SMC migration and the modulation of this cell-to-cell interaction by extracellular matrix is not well understood.\nTo examine this relationship SMCs and ECs were cocultured on opposite sides of a semipermeable membrane and were compared with SMCs cultured alone. To assess migration SMCs were plated at confluent density into the center of the membrane with a steel fence. After the fence was removed, SMCs were treated for 2 hours with mitomycin C (20 micrograms/ml) to assess migration independent of proliferation. Cell migration was measured with morphometry. Experiments were performed on plastic and membranes coated with fibronectin or type I collagen (n > or = 8/group). Cell adhesiveness was quantitated by cell attachment and spreading assays.\nECs stimulated SMC migration by 187% when compared with SMCs cultured alone on plastic and by 160% when cultured on fibronectin (p < 0.01). Type I collagen stimulated migration of SMCs cultured alone and prevented EC stimulated migration in cocultured SMCs (p < 0.01). Cell adhesiveness was significantly increased in cocultured SMCs compared with SMCs cultured alone regardless of whether cells were cultured on plastic (EC/SMC, 13.5 +/- 0.6 SMCs/high power field vs SMC, 8.9 +/- 0.5, p < 0.01), fibronectin (16.3 +/- 0.8 vs 12.3 +/- 0.7, p < 0.01) or type I collagen (15.5 +/- 1.0 vs 12.4 +/- 0.6, p < 0.01). ECs increased SMC cell spreading on plastic and fibronectin when compared with SMCs cultured alone. No difference in SMC cell spreading was seen in the presence or absence of ECs when cells were cultured on type I collagen. EC-SMC contact was not required; EC-conditioned media alone increased SMC migration by 75% when compared with SMCs cultured alone. Our data suggest that ECs increase SMC migration by a diffusable molecule that may also alter SMC adhesion molecule expression. Extracellular matrix composition can attenuate these effects.",

    "abstract": "It is commonly believed that the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in hospitalized children is less than in adults. However, it is possible that the disease is significantly underdiagnosed in children because the index of suspicion of pediatric practitioners is low, a substantial number of patients may have no symptoms, and DVT screening is not routinely performed. We therefore undertook a prospective study to define the incidence of DVT in hospitalized children with no symptoms.\nPatients included in the study were those younger than 18 years of age who were hospitalized for more than 72 hours and were identified to have two or more risk factors for the development of DVT and had at least one screening duplex scan. Risk factors for the development of DVT considered were a history of DVT or pulmonary embolism, recent operation, immobilization, trauma, stroke or acute neurologic deficit, the presence of cancer, sepsis, greater than 150% ideal body weight, a hypercoagulable state, and the presence of a femoral venous catheter.\nOver the 9-month period ending December 1994, 1997 patients 17 years of age and younger were admitted to the hospital, and 59 patients including 19 girls and 40 boys were enrolled in the study. The one patient with DVT was a 17-year-old boy hospitalized after a motor vehicle accident with blunt head trauma and a neurologic deficit who underwent multiple orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures.\nThe development of acute DVT in children is unusual. As a result, DVT prophylaxis and screening is unnecessary in young children with only two risk factors for the development of the disease. Young age appears to be an important protective risk factor for the prevention of DVT.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether Doppler measurements of peak velocity and four other quantitative measures of spectral shape are affected significantly by the site of the Doppler recording in relation to the location of the maximum stenosis.\nContinuous-wave and pulsed Doppler recordings were made distal to a 70% (area reduction or 45% diameter reduction) asymmetric stenosis in an in vitro flow model under steady and pulsatile flow conditions. Recordings were taken at six different locations proximal and distal to the stenosis. A photochromic dye technique was used to visualize the actual flow field in the model.\nDistal to the stenosis, the flow visualization results demonstrated a strong radial and axial variation of the velocity field and thus explained why the Doppler measurements of peak frequency and spectral broadening were strongly dependent on the recording site. The peak frequency was maximum within the throat of the stenosis and returned to the prestenotic value five tube diameters distal to the stenosis. Other measurements of spectral broadening and spectral shape varied greatly depending on the location of the recording site in the poststenotic region. Higher order spectral moments such as the coefficient of kurtosis were found to exhibit large temporal variability, which makes them inappropriate as diagnostic indicators.\nBecause of the complex nature of the poststenotic flow field, these results clearly demonstrate that no single Doppler measurement can accurately quantify the severity of a stenosis. Of the Doppler measurements only peak velocity is related to the severity of stenosis. Reproducible peak velocity measurements are obtained only if the Doppler sample volume is positioned at or very near the throat of the stenosis and at an appropriate radial site that may not necessarily be at the center of the vessel.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular matrix proteins can stimulate smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration by three distinct mechanisms: chemokinesis (nondirected migration in the presence of soluble protein), chemotaxis (directed migration toward soluble protein), and haptotaxis (directed migration toward insoluble, substrate-bound protein). This study investigates the effects of four prevalent extracellular matrix proteins (collagen types I and IV, fibronectin, and laminin), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on haptotaxis, chemotaxis, and chemokinesis of human SMCs. The role of large guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins (G-proteins) in the signaling mediating these effects is also evaluated.\nHuman saphenous vein SMCs were used in all migration studies. Chemokinesis, chemotaxis, and haptotaxis to each of the matrix proteins were measured and compared with PDGF through the use of a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber. The role of G-proteins in matrix-induced SMC migration was studied with the modulators of G-protein function, cholera and pertussis toxins.\nFor all matrix proteins the relative strength of the various stimuli for migration was haptotaxis > chemotaxis > chemokinesis (p < 0.05). For all three stimuli collagen I and IV produced the most significant migration followed by fibronectin > PDGF-AB > laminin (p < 0.05). Pertussis toxin completely inhibited chemotaxis and partially inhibited haptotaxis by laminin but did not affect migration by other matrix proteins, whereas cholera toxin abolished migration in response to all four matrix proteins.\nMatrix proteins, with the exception of laminin, provide a more significant stimulus for SMC locomotion than does the prototypical agonist, PDGF-AB. Of the three mechanisms by which migration can be stimulated, haptotaxis elicits the most profound effect. The importance of G-proteins as second messengers for migration varies with each matrix protein and with the mechanism of stimulation.",

    "abstract": "In an attempt to improve graft patency results of prosthetic bypasses to infrapopliteal arteries, we used a new type of adjunctive technique that combines an arteriovenous fistula and vein interposition (AVF/VI).\nOver the past 5 years, 68 such reconstructions were performed in 62 patients with critical ischemia in whom a totally autogenous vein bypass was not feasible. Forty-seven patients (76%) had one or more failed ipsilateral infrainguinal bypasses. The AVF/VI was performed by transposing the central portion of the adjacent deep vein onto the side of the recipient artery. The distal end of a 6-mm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) ringed graft then was anastomosed to the hood of the AVF. The segment of vein interposed between the PTFE graft and the recipient artery widened the anastomosis and improved the compliance mismatch. Simultaneous pressure measurements of the radial artery and the distal portion of the graft were obtained in all cases.\nSignificant pressure gradients ranging from 35 to 70 mm Hg were detected in 26 bypasses (38%), which led to banding of the venous outflow that decreased the gradient to within 20 mm Hg. A gradient < or = 30 mm Hg was found in 28 bypasses (41%), and no banding was required if the absolute intragraft systolic pressure was > or = 100 mm Hg. Only 14 bypasses (21%) had no detectable pressure gradients. Twenty-six bypasses originated from femoral arteries, 34 from iliac arteries, and 8 from patent proximal grafts. The recipient arteries were the anterior tibial artery in 33 cases, posterior tibial in 17, peroneal in 15, dorsalis pedis in 2, and lateral plantar in 1. All patients began a regimen of heparin 6 to 8 hours after surgery and continued to receive chronic anticoagulation. Cumulative, 3-year assisted primary graft patency rates were 78%, 70%, and 62%, respectively. Cumulative 3-year AVF patency rates were 65%, 57%, and 46%, respectively. The 3-year limb salvage rate was approximately 78%.\nAdjunctive AVF/VI significantly improves infrapopliteal PTFE graft patency and limb salvage rates. The combination of a decreased compliance mismatch at the distal anastomosis and the abolishment of a large pressure gradient at the distal anastomosis while maintaining higher graft flow rates may have contributed to the improved results.",

    "abstract": "This consistent observation of a reduction of the elastin concentration in abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) has led us to investigate in AAA specimens two metalloproteinases that display elastase activity, MMP2 (gelatinase A/72kDa) and MMP9 (gelatinase B/92 kDa).\nSamples of full-thickness aortic wall, adherent thrombus, and serum were collected in 10 patients with AAAs. Samples of normal aortic wall and serum were taken from 6 age-matched control patients. Quantitative gelatin-zymography and gelatinolytic soluble assays after acetyl-phenyl mercuric acid activation were performed on serum and tissue extracts, and the results were expressed in units on a comparative wet-weight basis. Histologic analysis was performed in parallel to score the inflammatory infiltrate.\nThe luminal and parietal parts of the thrombus contained, respectively, 20- and 10-fold more gelantinolytic activity than the serum. The predominate form was MMP9. Although the total gelatinolytic activity was in the same range both in AAAs and in normal walls, a significantly higher proportion of MMP9 was found in the aneurysmal aortic walls. Furthermore, a significant proportion of MMP9 was under its processed active form, which was never observed in normal samples. A significantly higher proportion of MMP2 was also present as processed active form in AAA wall. This latter parameter positively correlated with the inflammatory score.\nThe presence of activated MMP9 and MMP2 might contribute to the degradation of the extracellular matrix proteins that occurs during the development of aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Variability in outcome after carotid endarterectomy is well recognized. This study examines the importance of patient-related factors in determining outcome.\nFour hundred and sixty consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic severe (60% to 99%) internal carotid stenosis performed by one vascular surgeon have been studied prospectively. Patients were followed-up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and then yearly. Pre-, intra-, and perioperative details and follow-up information were entered on a database.\nMultiple logistic regression identified a number of factors significantly associated with death and stroke. A history of crescendo transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) (p = 0.003, p = 0.0002) and being female (p = 0.03, p = 0.0001) were associated with both perioperative death and stroke within 30 days of operation, respectively. Deaths between 1 and 36 months were associated with ischemic heart disease (p = 0.03) and diabetes (p = 0.04), whereas stroke was associated with small internal carotid diameter (p = 0.02). The importance of symptoms at presentation on outcome was further emphasized by life-table analysis. In 98% of patients with amaurosis fugax, only 67% of those with crescendo TIAs were alive at 18 months (p < 0.01). The survival of patients with amaurosis was significantly better than those with TIAs (p < 0.01), transient stroke (p < 0.01), and progressive, stroke (p < 0.05). Similarly, postoperative stroke was significantly more common for patients with crescendo TIAs than those with amaurosis (p < 0.01), established stroke (p < 0.05), and TIA (p < 0.05). Transient stroke was associated with a poor outcome, with only 66% of patients being alive in 36 months and 14% having suffered a stroke (p < 0.05 compared with established stroke).\nPresenting symptoms significantly predict outcome after carotid endarterectomy. This should be considered both in patient selection and comparison of patient series.",

Data were analyzed from 837 consecutive patients (1006 cases) who underwent carotid endarterectomy with homologous vein patch angioplasty between 1981 and 1993.\nThe perioperative mortality rate was 0.8% (eight patients). Two deaths (0.2%) were attributed to ipsilateral strokes. Ischemic strokes occurred in 12 patients (1.2%; 10 ipsilateral), and ipsilateral transient ischemic attacks occurred in three patients (0.3%). Follow-up data were obtained for 482 patients (56%; mean follow-up time, 61 months; range, 1 to 132 months). Ipsilateral recurrent symptoms occurred in eight patients (1.7%; seven strokes, one transient ischemic attack).

The 10-year overall survival rate was 76% +/- 3.2%, and the 10-year rate of freedom from late ipsilateral morbidity was 96% +/- 1.4%. The 10-year rate of freedom from late stenosis (a reduction in diameter of > or = 20%) in the 220 arteries (22%) that were studied by duplex scan was 84% +/- 2.3%.\nThe postoperative mortality and neurologic morbidity rates of carotid endarterectomy with homologous vein patch angioplasty are similar to those in the best series with all types of closure.

Two patients who had leg ischemia after retrieval of an intraaortic balloon pump underwent angiograms that showed occlusion of the right external iliac artery because of dissection (one case) or thrombosis (one case). Percutaneous self-expandable stents were implanted in the occluded vessels, and they fully restored normal iliac patency with no complications and satisfactory midterm follow-up results. We conclude that iliac artery occlusion induced by aortic counterpulsation can be safely treated by implanting self-expandable stents in cases of acute iatrogenic dissection.",

Because they are quite rare events, we describe for the first time in the English-language literature two cases of a combination of true aneurysms of the popliteal and tibial arteries. Symptoms at initial examination are calf mass and distal ischemia. Clinical features, radiographic findings, surgical management, and a review of the literature on true infrapopliteal aneurysms are discussed.",

The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of MRI, plain radiography, and nuclear scanning were determined for diagnosing osteomyelitis, and a cost comparison was made.\nTwenty-seven patients with diabetic foot infections were studied prospectively. All patients underwent MRI and plain radiography. Twenty-two patients had technetium bone scans, and 19 patients had Indium scans. Nineteen patients had all four tests performed. Patients with obvious gangrene or a fetid foot were excluded.\nThe diagnosis of osteomyelitis was established by pathologic specimen (n = 18), bone culture (n = 3), or successful response to medical management (n = 6). Osteomyelitis was confirmed in nine of the pathologic specimens. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for MRI was 88%, 100%, and 95%, respectively, for plain radiography it was 22%, 94%, and 70%, respectively, for technetium bone scanning it was 50%, 50%, and 50%, respectively, and for Indium leukocyte scanning it was 33%, 69%, and 58%, respectively. The data were analyzed statistically with the two-tailed Fisher's exact test. MRI was the only test that was statistically significant (p < 0.01).\nMRI appeared to be the single best test for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis associated with diabetic foot infections.

    "abstract": "Although pressure measurements are useful in the assessment of the severity of the arterial obstruction, they do not completely identify limbs with and without critical limb ischemia. Our objective was to test whether addition of the measurements of toe pulse waves (PW), which depend on distal perfusion, to pressure measurements could improve the determination of the severity of arterial disease and the presence of critical limb ischemia.\nWe measured toe pressure (TSP) and ankle/brachial index (ABI) and recorded PW with photoplethysmography in 358 limbs of 182 patients.\nTSP, ABI, and PW amplitude were lower in 67 limbs with rest pain, skin lesions, or both, with mean differences of 29 mm Hg, 0.12, and 16 mm, respectively (p < 0.01). Similarly, in the subgroup of 107 limbs with TSP < or = 30 mm Hg, TSP, and PW amplitude, but not ABI, were lower in 53 limbs with rest pain, skin lesions, or both, with mean differences of 10 mm Hg and 7 mm (p < 0.01). Multiple logistic regression showed that after controlling was done for TSP and ABI, the odds ratio for the presence of rest pain, skin lesions, or both associated with PW amplitude < or = 4 mm was 4.3 (95% confidence interval 1.7, 11.0; p < 0.01). In the subgroup with TSP < or = 30 mm Hg, this odds ratio was 3.5 (95% confidence interval 1.0, 11.6; p < 0.05).\nThe findings indicate that addition of PW recording to pressure measurements is likely to increase the accuracy of assessment for critical limb ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Blunt injuries to the internal carotid artery (ICA) at the base of the skull are uncommon but potentially dangerous lesions whose management remains unclear. We report a new surgical approach of the intrapetrosal portion of the ICA that was used in six patients with the help of an ear, nose, and throat surgeon.\nDuring a 70-month period, seven consecutive patients (four women, three men; mean age, 35.7 years; range, 21 to 59 years) were admitted, six after a motor vehicle accident and one after a cervical manipulation. All patients had a neurologic deficit. An arteriographic scan revealed four unilateral ICA lesions: two false aneurysms, one tight stenosis, and one dissection; two cases of bilateral ICA dissection were mentioned, and one case of ICA dissection was associated with a contralateral ICA thrombosis.\nOne patient died before surgery, and six patients underwent a unilateral venous graft restoration, reaching the vertical portion of the intrapetrosal ICA in two patients and the horizontal portion in four. A shunt was used in one patient. Failure to recognize the end of the ICA lesion was responsible for one postoperative asymptomatic graft thrombosis (17%), but this difficulty was overcome by using intraoperative angioscopy in the other patients. No deaths and no new strokes were noted during postoperative and midterm follow-up (mean follow-up, 34 months). Five postoperative facial pareses occurred and were totally regressive within 3 to 6 months in four patients; one total deafness was recorded.\nVenous graft restoration of traumatic ICA lesions at the base of the skull can safely be performed with such an approach, thus producing highly satisfactory results. Before undergoing surgery, the patient must be aware of the risk of facial and auditive disorders, which are generally temporary.",

    "abstract": "Successful use of the distal adjunctive arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) for the enhancement of prosthetic graft patency rates in the crural position is critically dependent on the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the arterial and venous runoff. Precise technical performance of the fistula is equally vital to secure optimal results. The purpose of this study was to determine current prosthetic graft patency and limb salvage rates using a modified version of the common ostium dAVF.\nThe standard method to create the common ostium variant of dAVF has been modified to improve apposition of the \"otomy\" sites of the artery and vein, avoid twisting and stenosis by terminating the fistula suture line at the artery-vein junctures, reshaping the ovoid ostium to a rectangular shape, and finally, use of multiple interrupted heel-toe sutures.\nSince 1979 we have created 290 fistulas in 281 patients who required leg revascularization procedures. In different time periods we have documented improving graft patency and limb salvage rates. Fistula patency, reflected by annual attrition rates of 13% to 26% per year, continues as a challenge for long-term results. Current 3-year secondary cumulative graft patency and limb salvage rates by life table analysis are 61% and 74%, respectively. The conduit material may play a role with regard to steal phenomena and the need for banding techniques.\nConfiguration of the adjunctive dAVF may impact on prosthetic graft patency in the crural position. In addition, the type of graft material used for bypass may be instrumental in preventing or precipitating the steal phenomenon. These issues require further study to better understand flow dynamics, patterns of intimal hyperplasia, and blood distribution as a function of conduit material and impedance of the arterial and venous runoff.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the institution of a clinical protocol combining 6 hours of recovery room observation and guidelines for intensive care unit (ICU) admission would allow selected patients to be safely transferred directly to a surgical floor after nonaortic arterial reconstruction.\nAfter a clinical pathway was formed, 134 consecutive patients undergoing 154 nonaortic arterial operations were prospectively enrolled in this study. Patients requiring ICU care and the responsible factors were identified. Comparisons of risk factors and demographics were made between those patients who did and did not require ICU care.\nTwelve (7.8%) patients spent a total of 27 days in the ICU (range 1 to 11 days). As per our guidelines four patients were transferred to the ICU for invasive monitoring, and four were sent to the ICU because of refractory hemodynamic instability or arrhythmia in the postanesthetic recovery room. An additional four patients were transferred to the ICU after having been on the surgical floor for 24 to 72 hours because of the following perioperative complications: prolonged chest pain (one), pneumonia (one), heart failure (one), and graft occlusion requiring a urokinase infusion. Patients admitted to the ICU were more likely to have heart disease (p = 0.02) and to have had an operation other than carotid endarterectomy (p = 0.04) than those who were not. The 30-day mortality rate was 1.4%.\nThe implementation of a clinical protocol similar to the one used in this study will allow many patients undergoing nonaortic vascular surgery to avoid the use of the ICU. This approach will conserve hospital and financial resources without adversely affecting patient morbidity and mortality rates.",

As per our guidelines four patients were transferred to the ICU for invasive monitoring, and four were sent to the ICU because of refractory hemodynamic instability or arrhythmia in the postanesthetic recovery room. An additional four patients were transferred to the ICU after having been on the surgical floor for 24 to 72 hours because of the following perioperative complications: prolonged chest pain (one), pneumonia (one), heart failure (one), and graft occlusion requiring a urokinase infusion. Patients admitted to the ICU were more likely to have heart disease (p = 0.02) and to have had an operation other than carotid endarterectomy (p = 0.04) than those who were not. The 30-day mortality rate was 1.4%.",

    "abstract": "Reduction of the thrombogenicity of synthetic vascular grafts by endothelialization has been suggested. The purpose of this study was to examine some of the non-thrombogenic properties of cultured adult human great saphenous vein endothelial cells seeded on expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts.\nEndothelialized grafts, control grafts, and wells were incubated with thrombin. Assays of thrombin loss from solution, thrombin coagulant activity, and protein C activation on the surface were obtained. The presence of thrombomodulin was confirmed with immunohistochemistry.\nSignificantly more thrombin was found on the ePTFE grafts or wells that underwent endothelialization, and larger amounts were lost from the thrombin solution compared with the control group. Thrombin enzyme activity on the endothelialization group was almost completely represented by activation of protein C and only to a minor extent by activity towards fibrinogen.\nIt is concluded that endothelial cells seeded on ePTFE retain the possibility to inhibit thrombin coagulant activity and to activate protein C. These findings provide support for the clinical applicability of cultured autologous endothelium on ePTFE grafts.",

    "abstract": "Although autologous blood procurement has become a standard of care in elective surgery, recent studies have questioned its cost-effectiveness. We therefore reviewed our 3-year experience with intraoperative cell salvage in patients who underwent elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.\nA 3-year retrospective chart review of elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (infrarenal and suprarenal) repair was performed. Transthoracic repairs were excluded.\nEstimated blood lost was 1748 +/- 1236 ml, or 35% of baseline blood volume (5012 +/- 689 ml). Overall, 164 (89%) received red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (3.5 +/- 2.0 U/patient). The cost per patient for cell salvage was $315 +/- $97, representing 31% of all RBC costs and 24% of total blood component costs. Mean salvage volume infused was 578 +/- 600 ml; at a mean hematocrit level of 55.7% the RBC volume infused from salvage during surgery was 313 +/- 328 ml (representing 27% of total RBC volume lost during the hospital stay). This mean RBC volume salvaged represented the equivalent of 1.6 blood bank RBC units. The mean blood bank costs saved by using cell salvage was $248, or 79% of the $315 actually spent for salvage. We found no decrease in percentage of patients undergoing transfusion until salvage volumes that were infused exceeded 750 ml, or the equivalent of two blood bank units; all of these patients who benefitted had estimated blood lost > or = 1000 ml.\nWe conclude that use of intraoperative cell salvage was most beneficial for patients who had estimated blood loss greater than or equal to 1000 ml and cell salvage volumes infused greater than or equal to 750 ml. Patients who are estimated to lose less than 1000 ml receive little benefit yet incur substantial costs from intraoperative cell salvage.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine factors that may influence patient selection for surgery in recurrent carotid stenosis (RCS) and to contrast the results of primary and secondary carotid endarterectomy (CENDX) with regard to operative morbidity and stroke prevention.\nForty-eight patients who underwent CENDX for RCS (RCS-OP group) were compared with a contemporaneous group of 40 patients who on at least one post-CENDX duplex ultrasonography study had a greater than 50% stenosis but did not undergo operation (RCS-NO-OP group). This latter group was drawn from 1053 follow-up duplex studies in 348 patients who underwent primary CENDX between the years 1983 and 1993. Each of these two groups was compared with a metanalysis of six key series derived from the literature.\nNo significant differences were seen in the demographics or the incidence of risk factors between the two groups except for a higher incidence of coronary artery disease (p < 0.03) and peripheral vascular disease (p < 0.001) in the RCS-OP group. The operation-specific stroke rate was 2.1%, and the 30-day mortality was also 2.1%. Symptomatic RCS was the indication in 56% of cases. Important anatomic differences were found between groups. The duplex/arteriographic degree of stenosis was greater than 90% in 75% of the patients in the RCS-OP group, whereas only 10% of the patients in the RCS-NO-OP group had greater than 80% stenosis, most being in the 50% to 80% range. An unexpected finding was the sudden progression to occlusion in 10 (25%) of 40 in the RCS-NO-OP group, with 2 (5%) of 10 of the occlusions presenting as unheralded strokes. Overall, a stroke without an antecedent transient ischemic attack occurred in 3 (7.5%) of 40 of patients in the RCS-NO-OP group, all in patients with greater than 75% stenosis on their last documented scan preceding the stroke.\nGiven the relatively low stroke rate with surgery in the RCS-OP group (2.1%) and the higher incidence of unheralded strokes (7.5%) in the RCS-NO-OP group, a more aggressive approach may be warranted in patients with asymptomatic high-grade (> 75%) RCS, a strategy not unlike that adopted for primary CENDX.",

Platelet uptake was measured on the patch itself and on the artery wall that was opposite to the patch and that had undergone endarterectomy. Scanning electron microscopy was used to confirm the localization of the labeled platelets on the patch and on the surface that had undergone endarterectomy.\nAlthough considerable variation was seen among animals, platelet accumulation was lowest in the vein patches compared with the prosthetic patches (p < 0.01), but the deposition on the gelatine-sealed Dacron was not significantly different from that on polytetrafluoroethylene patches. Platelet deposition on the artery wall that had undergone endarterectomy was considerably less than on the patch but was higher when a synthetic patch was used rather than a vein patch (p < 0.05).\nAcute thrombus deposition after carotid endarterectomy was considerably less for vein patch closure than for synthetic patches.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the immediate and mid-term results of thoracoscopic upper dorsal (T2-T3) sympathectomy for primary palmar hyperhidrosis.\nFrom June 1993 to October 1994 we performed 106 sympathectomies on 53 patients with palmar hyperhidrosis. Thirty-four female patients and 19 male patients ranging in age from 15 to 44 years, (mean 23.1 years) were studied. Both sides were operated during the same surgical procedure. The T2-T3 ganglia were resected by electrocuting with a hook and were removed for histologic examination. Follow-up for a mean of 19.25 months was obtained on 52 patients (104 operated limbs).\nAll limbs were completely dry at the end of the procedure, and hyperhidrosis did not recur during the whole follow-up period. Short-term postoperative complications (mainly atelectasis, pneumonia, pneumothorax, and hemothorax) occurred in six (11.3%) patients. Long-term sequelae were observed in 43 (81.1%) patients and included Horner's syndrome (9 patients, 17.3%, one side only in each patient), neuralgia (7 patients, 13.5%), and compensatory hyperhidrosis (35 patients, 67.3%). These sequelae were not permanent in all cases, and the degree of severity was variable. Six (11.5%) patients, three of whom regretted being operated, were dissatisfied with their results: one because of Horner's syndrome, one because of persisting neuralgia, and four because of compensatory sweating.\nDespite the large number of postoperative long-term sequelae, 88.5% of patients expressed subjective satisfaction from the procedure. Obtaining 100% of dry hands on mid-term follow-up makes this approach rewarding.",

Long-term sequelae were observed in 43 (81.1%) patients and included Horner's syndrome (9 patients, 17.3%, one side only in each patient), neuralgia (7 patients, 13.5%), and compensatory hyperhidrosis (35 patients, 67.3%). These sequelae were not permanent in all cases, and the degree of severity was variable. Six (11.5%) patients, three of whom regretted being operated, were dissatisfied with their results: one because of Horner's syndrome, one because of persisting neuralgia, and four because of compensatory sweating.",

    "abstract": "To determine the impact of white blood cell (WBC)-endothelium adhesion on tissue damage in the setting of ischemia-reperfusion injury in striated muscle.\nThe cremaster muscle of four groups of anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats was subjected to 4 hours of global, warm (37 degrees C) ischemia and 2 hours of reperfusion. At reperfusion two groups of animals received intravenous injections of monoclonal antibodies directed against either CD11b/CD18 (1B6) or ICAM-1 (1A29). The remaining two groups of animals received saline injections (NoRx) or nonreactive IgG1. In vivo light microscopic techniques were used to determine WBC adherence (number of WBCs per 100 microns postcapillary venules) at different intervals of reperfusion. Muscle viability was assessed with computer-assisted image analysis by measuring the optical intensity of transilluminated muscles after incubation with nitroblue tetrazolium.\nOur results (mean +/- SEM) demonstrate a significant increase in the number of adherent WBCs relative to baseline (8.0 +/- 0.5) after 4 hours of global ischemia in animals receiving NoRx or IgG1. The significant increase occurred at 30 minutes of reperfusion (17.6 +/- 0.6 and 17.4 +/- 0.4 for NoRx or IgG1, respectively) and was sustained for the duration of the experiment. This increase in adherence was attenuated by 1B6 and 1A29 (12.2 +/- 2.2 and 12.4 +/- 0.8, respectively; p < 0.05 compared with NoRx and IgG1). The decrease in WBC adhesion was associated with a decrease in reperfusion injury to the muscle, as indicated by lower optical intensity values for the 1B6 and 1A29 groups (123 +/- 3 and 129 +/- 2) compared with the NoRx and IgG1 groups (151 +/- 2 and 158 +/- 4).\nOur data support an important role for WBCs in the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Interfering with the WBC-endothelium interactions by using monoclonal antibodies directed against WBCs and endothelial cell adhesion molecules may help to limit ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

A review of the literature indicates that 35 documented cases of primary tumors of the aorta have been reported over the past 120 years. The histologic and morphologic characteristics of these lesions may be variable. In this case, progressive claudication of the left leg and buttocks with absent femoral pulses in a middle-aged woman was found to be a primary leiomyosarcoma of the abdominal aorta. A magnetic resonance imaging study defined a retroperitoneal space-occupying mass on the left side of the aorta at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebrae. A magnetic resonance angiographic scan of the abdominal aorta and an aortogram revealed total occlusion of the distal abdominal aorta with reconstitution at the level of the common femoral arteries bilaterally, with normal vessels more distal to that region. The patient underwent surgical exploration and resection of the retroperitoneal, infrarenal, occluding aortic mass. The mass was found to be a high-grade sarcoma displaying smooth muscle cell differentiation. The resection of this lesion, perioperative management, and pathologic characteristics of a rare primary neoplasm of the aorta are discussed in this review.",

On the basis of experimental studies in our laboratory that demonstrated prolonged antistaphylococcal activity of rifampin-bonded, gelatin-impregnated Dacron grafts after implantation in the arterial circulation, this conduit was successfully used for in situ replacement of a native aortic infection in two patients. Both patients had fever, leukocytosis, abdominal or back pain, and a computed tomographic scan that demonstrated contained rupture of a mycotic aneurysm. Preoperative computed tomography-guided aspiration and culture of periaortic fluid from one patient grew Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment consisted of prolonged (6 weeks) culture-specific parenteral antibiotic therapy, excision of involved aorta, oxychlorosene irrigation of the aortic bed, and restoration of aortic continuity by in situ prosthetic replacement. A preliminary right axillobifemoral bypass was performed in the patient who had an infection involving the suprarenal and infrarenal aorta. In both patients intraoperative culture of aorta wall recovered S. aureus. Patients were discharged at 20 and 21 days. Clinical follow-up and computed tomographic imaging of the replacement graft beyond 10 months after surgery demonstrated no signs of residual aortic infection. In the absence of gross pus and frank sepsis, the use of an antibiotic-bonded prosthetic graft with antistaphylococcal activity should be considered in patients who have arterial infections caused by S. aureus when excision and ex situ bypass are not feasible.",

    "abstract": "Vein graft stenosis caused by intimal hyperplasia (IH) accounts for 30% to 50% of late bypass graft failures; however, the biochemical mediators of vein graft IH have been poorly defined. We attempted to evaluate the spatial and temporal distribution of five principal cytokines (interleukin-1 beta [IL-1 beta], platelet-derived growth factor-AA [PDGF-AA], basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF], interferon gamma [INF gamma], and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha]) during the development of IH in a rat vein graft model.\nRat epigastric vein interposition grafts in the femoral artery were harvested at 6 hours, 2 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after the grafting procedure and studied with immunohistochemical and standard histologic techniques. The cytokine expression in the endothelium and media/neointima was quantified as the percentage of immunopositive cells per high-power field.\nMaximal hyperplasia occurred 2 weeks after the grafting procedure. Peak expression of IL-1 beta and bFGF occurred by 2 days. PDGF-AA expression paralleled the development of IH, peaking at 2 weeks and then declining. TNF-alpha expression increased at 1 week and remained elevated. INF gamma was seen only in control grafts.\nThe coordinated early release of IL-1 beta and bFGF and the down-regulation of INF gamma seem to trigger an inflammatory response, thereby initiating IH. The process then is propagated by the release of PDGF-AA and TNF-alpha, with concomitant smooth muscle cell proliferation and production of extracellular matrix. It is likely that this complex milieu of local paracrine signaling is required to generate the hyperplastic response seen in failing vein grafts.",

The purpose of the study was to determine the incidence of complications and the durability of the access to better determine the role of this procedure in the dialysis access algorithm.\nA single center's experience over a period of 5 years was retrospectively reviewed.\nTwenty-six axillary grafts were placed in 24 patients. All but one were used for dialysis. At the time of access creation, the patients had been undergoing dialysis for a mean of 77 months (range, 5 to 256 months), had had a mean of 9.4 previous access procedures, and had exhausted all arm sites. The life-table patency rate at 3 years was 60%. The incidence of infection and thrombosis were comparable with conventional arm bridge fistulas. Neither vascular steal phenomenon nor neurologic injury occurred in this series.\nAxillary artery-to-axillary vein or axillary artery-to-jugular vein polytetrafluoroethylene bridge fistula is an excellent and durable secondary access strategy. We recommend that it be used after exhaustion of conventional arm sites.",

    "abstract": "The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and the Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Study (ACAS) both confirmed the effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy for preventing stroke in patients who have significant carotid stenosis. A uniform technique for measuring carotid stenosis from an arteriogram (% stenosis = [1 - minimum residual lumen/normal distal cervical internal carotid artery diameter] x 100) was used in both trials, with reproducibility internally validated. The reliability of this measurement when used outside the trials for defining carotid stenosis has not been validated. Imprecise calculation of carotid stenosis can result in a 50% overestimation of significant carotid disease and potential overuse of carotid surgery. This is a prospective study of the reliability of carotid stenosis measurements performed by practicing physicians of different specialties and different levels of clinical experience.\nTwo vascular surgeons and two interventional radiologists (one resident and one staff member per specialty), blinded to results, calculated the percent stenosis from 219 consecutive arteriograms performed to evaluate extracranial carotid artery occlusive disease; 72 random films were reread by each individual. The interpretations were grouped as < 60% or > or = 60% stenosis (ACAS) and as < 30%, 30% to 69%, and > or = 70% stenosis (NASCET). Interobserver and intraobserver agreement were analyzed with the kappa statistic and Pearson correlation coefficients.\nInterobserver reliability in categorizing carotid stenosis revealed excellent agreement for both ACAS (kappa = 0.825 to 0.903) and NASCET groups (kappa = 0.729 to 0.793). Interobserver correlation coefficients ranged from 0.91 to 0.95. Intraobserver agreement was also highly reproducible for both the ACAS (kappa = 0.732 to 0.970) and NASCET categories (kappa = 0.634 to 0.805). Intraobserver correlation coefficients ranged from 0.89 to 0.95.\nThe NASCET technique for quantification of carotid stenosis can be easily learned by physicians and reliably implemented for appropriate identification of candidates for carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this project was to evaluate the feasibility of aortoscopy for guidance of endoluminal aortic procedures and to determine whether aortoscopy has advantages over fluoroscopy in a pig model.\nTo establish feasibility aortoscopic guidance was used for making endoluminal aortic measurements, cannulating small arteries for arteriograpy, and placing intraaortic stents and grafts in 11 pigs. To compare aortoscopy and fluoroscopy measurements were made and stents were placed by a surgeon using only aortoscopic guidance in 10 pigs and by an interventional radiologist using only fluoroscopic guidance in 10 pigs. Postmortem dissections were performed to determine measurement and device placement accuracy.\nIn the feasibility study aortoscopic measurements differed from postmortem measurements by a mean distance (+/- SD) of 1.2 +/- 0.2 mm. Stents and grafts were placed a mean of 2.3 +/- 1.9 mm distal to the most inferior renal artery with no stent covering an orifice. All attempts at cannulating spinal arteries greater than 2 mm in diameter were successful. In the comparison of aortoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance, fluoroscopic measurements differed from postmortem measurements by 2.6 +/- 2.4 mm (p = 0.223). Stents placed with aortoscopic guidance were 1.1 +/- 1.3 mm distal to the most inferior renal artery, whereas stents placed with fluoroscopic guidance were 3.4 +/- 2.5 mm distal to the most inferior renal artery (p = 0.019).\nThese results demonstrate that aortoscopy is a useful guidance system for endoluminal aortic procedures and may have advantages over fluoroscopy alone.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to evaluate the application of duplex scanning during infrainguinal vein grafting procedures to verify vein conduit preparation, anastomotic patency, and graft hemodynamics.\nBetween 1991 and 1995, 275 infrainguinal vein bypasses (in situ, 114; reversed, 82; nonreversed translocated, 48; spliced alternative/arm vein, 31) to the popliteal (n = 116) or an infrageniculate artery (n = 159) were scanned during surgery for sites of color Doppler flow abnormality. Duplex-detected defects were graded with peak systolic velocity and velocity ratio criteria. Sites that demonstrated highly disturbed flow (peak systolic velocity > 180 cm/sec, velocity ratio > 2.4) were immediately revised by direct repair, patch angioplasty, or interposition grafting.\nIntraoperative duplex scanning prompted revision of 50 abnormalities in 43 of the 275 grafts (16%), including 32 vein and seven anastomotic stenoses, nine vein segments with platelet thrombus, and two bypasses with low flow. The intraoperative revision rate was lowest (p < 0.02) for reversed saphenous vein bypasses (7%) compared with other grafting techniques (in situ, 20%; nonreversed translocated, 15%; spliced alternative vein, 23%). The revision rates of popliteal and tibial bypasses were similar (14% vs 17%). A normal result shown by intraoperative scan (235 bypasses) was associated with a low 90-day thrombosis (0.4%) and revision (2%) rate, whereas six of 15 grafts (40%) with residual and 13 of 25 grafts (52%) with unrepaired duplex abnormalities required corrective procedures (p < 0.001). One graft failed within 3 months (secondary patency rate, 99%).\nIntraoperative duplex scanning accurately predicted the technical adequacy of infrainguinal vein grafts and was particularly useful in assessing bypasses constructed with valve lysis techniques or alternative veins. Early graft revisions indicated by duplex monitoring for thrombosis or stenosis were the result of a progression of residual defects and platelet thrombus formation rather than inadequate graft run-off flow.",

At the third operation, 21 patients underwent carotid patch angioplasty and 10 underwent carotid resection with an interposition saphenous vein graft. No postoperative strokes or deaths occurred; three patients (10%) had a peripheral nerve injury. Nine early (< 24 mo) secondary recurrent carotid stenoses occurred, and these patients underwent patch angioplasty. Twenty-three female, cigarette-smoking patients and 20 patients with elevated lipid levels had early restenosis and were identified as being at high risk for the development of another stenosis. A fourth significant stenosis developed in five of these high-risk patients who had saphenous vein patch angioplasty at their third carotid operation; eight other high-risk patients had carotid resection with an interposition saphenous vein graft, and no other stenosis developed.\nPatients who have secondary recurrent carotid stenoses can safely undergo a third carotid operation. Female habitual smokers with elevated lipid levels and an early restenosis appear to be at high risk of secondary recurrent carotid stenoses.

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine the safety and efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in the treatment of chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) in very high-risk surgical patients.\nTwenty-four focal mesenteric stenoses treated from 1984 to 1994 by PTA in 19 patients with CMI were reviewed. All 19 patients were considered poor surgical candidates. Seventeen patients had classic symptoms of CMI, and two patients had atypical abdominal complaints. Vessels dilated included the superior mesenteric artery (18), celiac artery (3), inferior mesenteric artery (1), aorta-superior mesenteric artery vein graft (1), and aorta-splenic artery vein graft (1). Complete follow-up was possible in all patients, with the exception of one patient who had no symptoms when last seen 17 months after the procedure.\nPTA was technically successful in 18 of 19 patients (95%) and 23 of 24 stenoses (96%). The lone technical failure resulted in superior mesenteric artery dissection with thrombosis and bowel infarction; the patient died despite emergent laparotomy and revascularization (mortality rate, 5%). Complete symptomatic relief was attained in 15 patients (79%), with follow-up showing continued relief of symptoms for a mean of 39 months (range, 4 to 101 months). Partial symptomatic relief was attained in three patients. Recurrent symptoms developed in three patients (20%) at a mean interval of 28 months (range, 9 to 43 months). Repeat PTA performed in two patients provided good technical results and relief from clinical symptoms. One patient had a symptomatic axillary sheath hematoma that required surgical decompression.\nMesenteric PTA is a valuable treatment option in patients who have CMI and are considered very high operative risks. The initial technical success rate is excellent, with the majority of patients having complete symptomatic improvement and continued relief of symptoms at short-term follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Unequivocal indications for renal artery reconstruction remain the presence of significant underlying renal insufficiency or severe hypertension. Thus surgical intervention for renal artery stenosis in the absence of this clinical picture may well be considered empirical and, as a consequence, treatment recommendations are ill-defined. Our experience with reconstruction of the minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic renal artery lesion in association with primary aortic repair over a 10-year period was reviewed.\nThirty-two patients who had atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis > or = 70% underwent prophylactic renal revascularization between 1982 and 1992. The patients' median age was 63 years (range, 44 to 79 years); 23 (72%) were men and nine (28%) were women. All had preoperative serum creatinine levels < or = 1.7 mg/dl (1.29 +/- 0.24 mg/dl) and were receiving either no antihypertensive medication (22%) or only a single agent (78%). Aortoiliac occlusive disease was present in 38% of this population, and aortic aneurysmal disease either alone or in combination with occlusive disease was found in 62%.\nOperative management included unilateral renal artery repair in 21 patients (66%) and bilateral renal revascularization in the remaining 11 (34%). The median decrease in postoperative serum creatinine level (> or = 7 days after operation) was 0.81 +/- 0.05% (mean postoperative serum creatinine level 1.27 +/- 0.07 mg/dl). The 30-day operative mortality rate was 3.1% (1 of 32). Late follow-up was available for 96% of patients (30 of 31; median, 64 months). Kaplan-Meier life table analysis revealed a 5-year probability of survival of 90.2% (95% confidence interval, 0.802 to 1.00). Stability of renal function was assessed by modeling the change in serum creatinine level over time with the intraclass correlation model. A serum creatinine level (mg/dl) = 1.3348 + 0.0011 x time (months) demonstrated minimal deterioration of excretory function during the observation period. Furthermore, the blood pressure of the majority of patients (75%) remained normal either with a single agent or without medication. Recurrent stenosis in one patient required treatment by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.\nAdjunctive repair of the renal artery may be an appropriate option in selected patients who undergo simultaneous aortic surgery, even in the absence of severe hypertension or renal insufficiency. Surgical intervention can be accomplished with acceptable perioperative morbidity rates, and stability of renal function is sustainable in the majority of patients.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the management and outcome of chronic atherosclerotic infrarenal aortic occlusion (IRAO), a review of 48 patients who were treated for angiographically documented IRAO between January 1980 and December 1994 was undertaken. Mean follow-up was 45 months. Mean age was 57 years (range, 33 to 88 years). Forty-seven patients were heavy smokers. Symptoms included claudication in 81%, rest pain in 25%, and tissue loss in 15%. Impotence was documented in 73% of men. Associated arterial disease included inferior mesenteric artery occlusion in 31 patients, renal artery stenosis or occlusion in 12, superior mesenteric artery stenosis in two, and celiac artery stenosis in one.\nForty inflow procedures were performed, including 17 thoracobifemoral bypass (TBF) procedures, 15 aortobifemoral/iliac bypass (ABFI) procedures, and eight axillobifemoral bypass (AXBF) procedures. Eight patients were managed without surgery. The thoracic aorta was chosen as the inflow source in 17 patients because of previous abdominal aortic surgery in eight, poor status of the abdominal aorta in eight, and horseshoe kidney in one.\nThe overall operative mortality rate was 5%, and the perioperative morbidity rate was 18%. There was no statistical difference in perioperative mortality and morbidity rates among the operative groups. The five-year survival rate (life-table) for all IRAO patients was 67%. TBF and ABFI revascularization procedures yielded 5-year patency rates of 71% and 79%, respectively (p < 0.05). All eight patients who underwent AXBF died or had occluded grafts at 3 years after surgery. Two-year patency rates (life-table) for TBF, ABFI, and AXBF were 92%, 92%, and 44%, respectively. The AXBF patency rate was significantly inferior to those of TBF and ABFI (p < 0.05). Changes in ankle-brachial indexes after TBF or ABFI were similar, but were significantly greater than changes after AXBF (p < 0.05). Three patients in the nonoperative group died, and two underwent major amputation. Acute renal failure did not occur in our study population. Follow-up creatinine levels > 2.0 mg/dl were documented in three operative patients and in one nonoperative patient, and none required dialysis.\nIn patients who have IRAO, aorta-based inflow procedures are superior to AXBF both in hemodynamic outcome and in patency rates. Treatment of IRAO with TBF or ABFI yields similar long-term results; the descending thoracic aorta represents an excellent inflow alternative to the abdominal aorta. Clinically significant renal impairment is rarely associated with IRAO. Nonoperative management of IRAO is associated with an increased mortality rate and a high rate of limb loss.",

Renal dysfunction (serum creatinine [SCr] > or = 1.3 mg/dl) was present in 82% of patients (mean SCr 2.4 mg/dl). Associations between blood pressure and renal function response to operation and preoperative parameters were examined. Clinical characteristics, response to operation, and dialysis-free survival were compared with those of 291 nondiabetic patients.\nFour (7.4%) operative deaths occurred. Among 50 survivors blood pressure response was considered cured or improved in 72% and unchanged in 28%. Of 42 patients with renal dysfunction 40% had improved function including three patients removed from dialysis. No preoperative parameter examined demonstrated a significant association with blood pressure or renal function response. During follow-up 10 additional patient deaths occurred, and eight patients progressed to dialysis dependence. Time to death or dialysis was associated with preoperative estimates of glomerular filtration (p = 0.03) and the change in estimates of glomerular filtration after operation (p = 0.01). Compared with 291 nondiabetics, the diabetic group had no statistical difference in improved function response (40% vs 51%, p = 0.21); however, diabetics had a significantly lower rate of beneficial blood pressure response (72% vs 89%, p = 0.01) and an increased risk of dialysis or death during follow-up (p = 0.02). By multivariate analysis independent predictors of time to death or dialysis included the presence of diabetes mellitus, patient age, history of congestive heart failure, and increased serum creatinine.\nMost of the selected diabetic patients had a beneficial blood pressure response after undergoing operative repair of atherosclerotic RVD, albeit at a lower rate compared with nondiabetics. In diabetics poor renal function before and after operation was associated with progression to dialysis and death. Improved renal function after operation was associated with improved survival; however, function response to renal revascularization was difficult to predict.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed a 13-year experience with an emphasis on long-term survival and renal function response when renal artery reconstruction (RAR) was performed primarily for the preservation or restoration of renal function in patients who had atherosclerotic renovascular disease.\nFrom January 1, 1980, to June 30, 1993, 139 patients underwent RAR for renal function salvage and were retrospectively reviewed. Inclusion criteria were either preoperative serum creatinine level > 2.0 mg/dl (67% of patients) or RAR to the entire functioning renal mass irrespective of baseline renal function. Patient survival was calculated by life-table methods. Cox regression analysis was used to determine relative risk (RR) estimates for the late outcomes of continued deterioration of renal function and late survival after RAR. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate variables associated with perioperative complications.\nClinical characteristics of the cohort were notable for advanced cardiac (history of congestive heart failure, 27%; angina, 22%; previous myocardial infarction, 19%) and renal disease (serum creatinine level < 2.0 mg/dl, 33%; 2.0 mg/dl to 3.0 mg/dl, 40%, > 3.0 mg/dl, 27%). Cardiac disease was the principle cause of early (6 of 11 operative deaths) and late death. Operative management consisted of aortorenal bypass in 47%, extraanatomic bypass in 45%, and endarterectomy in 8%; 45% of patients required combined aortic and RAR. The operative mortality rate was 8%; significant perioperative renal dysfunction occurred in 10%. Major operative morbidity was associated with increasing azotemia (RR = 2.1; p = 0.001; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 4.7 for each 1.0 mg/dl increase in baseline creatinine level). Of those patients who had a baseline creatinine level > or = 2.0 mg/dl, 54% had > or = 20% reduction in creatinine level after RAR. Late follow-up data were available for 87% of operative survivors at a mean duration of 4 years (range, 6 weeks to 12.6 years). Actuarial survival at 5 years was 52% +/- 5%. Continued deterioration in renal function occurred in 24% of patients who survived operation, and eventual dialysis was required in 15%. Deterioration of renal function after RAR was associated with increasing levels of preoperative creatinine (RR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.8; p = 0.001 for each 1.0 mg/dl increment in baseline creatinine level), and inversely related to early postoperative improvement in creatinine level (RR = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.9; p = 0.04).\nIntervention before major deterioration in renal function and an aggressive posture toward the frequently associated coronary artery disease are necessary to improve long-term results when RAR is performed for renal function salvage.",

Cardiac disease was the principle cause of early (6 of 11 operative deaths) and late death. Operative management consisted of aortorenal bypass in 47%, extraanatomic bypass in 45%, and endarterectomy in 8%; 45% of patients required combined aortic and RAR. The operative mortality rate was 8%; significant perioperative renal dysfunction occurred in 10%. Major operative morbidity was associated with increasing azotemia (RR = 2.1; p = 0.001; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 4.7 for each 1.0 mg/dl increase in baseline creatinine level). Of those patients who had a baseline creatinine level > or = 2.0 mg/dl, 54% had > or = 20% reduction in creatinine level after RAR. Late follow-up data were available for 87% of operative survivors at a mean duration of 4 years (range, 6 weeks to 12.6 years). Actuarial survival at 5 years was 52% +/- 5%. Continued deterioration in renal function occurred in 24% of patients who survived operation, and eventual dialysis was required in 15%. Deterioration of renal function after RAR was associated with increasing levels of preoperative creatinine (RR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.8; p = 0.001 for each 1.0 mg/dl increment in baseline creatinine level), and inversely related to early postoperative improvement in creatinine level (RR = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.9; p = 0.04).",

    "abstract": "The single major disadvantage of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) patch reconstruction with greater saphenous vein (GSV) is central patch rupture, which has a reported incidence of 0.5% to 4%. This is a prospective evaluation of the selective use of GSV for a CEA patch based on previously established vein diameter criteria.\nBetween 1988 and mid-1995, 534 of 671 CEAs (80%) were reconstructed with GSVs that had a distended diameter > or = 3.5 mm. Thigh veins were used in all 252 women who underwent CEA. Of the 282 men who underwent CEA, 265 GSVs (94%) were harvested from below the knee and 17 from the thigh. During this period four thigh and 13 below-knee veins (3.2%) were rejected because the diameter was < 3.5 mm, and a synthetic patch was used instead. In 408 of the CEAs with GSV (76%) the vein rupture pressures and diameters were measured, the CEA geometry was measured, and the predicted CEA vein patch rupture pressures were calculated.\nNo GSV patches ruptured in this series. This compares favorably with three patch ruptures in 239 previous CEAs when no vein diameter criteria was used (p = 0.03). This also compares favorably with a multicenter series of 13 GSV patch ruptures (0.73%) in 1773 CEAs (p = 0.03) and with a single-center series of eight ruptures (0.47%) in 1699 CEAs (p = 0.05). GSV diameters were 4.9 +/- 0.9 mm (mean +/- 1 SD); vein rupture pressures, 3.9 +/- 1.5 atmospheres; carotid bulb major axis diameters, 12.5 +/- 1.6 mm; carotid bulb maximum diameters of curvature, 14.2 +/- 2.2 mm; and CEA patch rupture pressures, 1.3 +/- 0.6 atmospheres (range, 280 mm Hg to 4 atmospheres). CEA vein patch rupture pressure correlates positively with vein diameter (p < 0.001, slope), but there is wide variability (correlation coefficient = 0.39). The 14 CEAs (3.4%) with predicted rupture pressures < 400 mm Hg were performed with veins 3.5 to 5.5 mm in diameter (mean, 4.2 mm), and all had carotid bulb major axis diameters > 12 mm (mean, 15.3 mm). Eight of these CEAs were reconstructed with thigh veins.\nUse of GSVs with a distended diameter > or = 3.5 mm for CEA patch reconstruction significantly reduces the probability of central patch rupture; however, a few CEAs reconstructed with veins > 3.5 mm in diameter and large carotid bulbs have predicted patch rupture pressures < 400 mm Hg. Because at times some veins will have rupture pressures lower than desirable, CEA reconstruction should be tailored to keep the carotid bulb major axis diameter < 13 mm.",

Eighty-five women and 149 men were evaluated. The median age was 67 years (range 8 to 88 years). Seventy-seven patients had type I thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, 99 had type II, 51 had type III or IV, and 7 had total descending thoracic aneurysm. Factors such as age, sex, aneurysm type, and visceral and distal aortic perfusion were examined with univariate fourfold table and multivariate logistic regression analysis.\nAcute renal failure, defined as an increase in serum creatinine by 1 mg/dl per day for two consecutive days after surgery, occurred in 41 (17.5%) of 234 patients. Thirty-six (15%) of 234 patients required dialysis. Twenty (49%) of 41 patients with acute renal failure died. Of the 21 survivors with renal failure, renal failure resolved in 18 (86%) within 30 days of surgery. The univariate odds ratio of death, given acute renal failure, was 6.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.2 to 14.2, p < 0.0001). No significant association was found between the probability of acute renal failure and age, sex, hypertension, right renal artery reattachment, or renal bypass. Factors associated with increased risk of acute renal failure in multivariate analysis were visceral perfusion (odds ratio [OR] = 3.6 95%, CI 1.2 to 11.0, p < 0.02), left renal artery reattachment (OR = 4.4 95%, CI 1.6 to 11.9, p < 0.004), preoperative creatinine > or = 2.8 mg/dl (OR = 10.3, 95% CI 12.0 to 411.8, p < 0.0001), and simple clamp technique (OR = 3.4 95%, CI 1.07 to 10.76, p < 0.04).

    "abstract": "This study was performed to determine the indications, operative strategy, and hemodynamic benefit of redo aortic grafting procedures after earlier excision of an infected aortic graft.\nAmong 164 patients treated for aortic graft infection, 15 later underwent redo aortic grafting procedures an average of 18 months (range, 1 to 59 months) after removal of an infected aortic graft. Redo grafting procedures were performed for leg ischemia (n = 11) or infection (proven, n = 3; suspected, n = 1). The new aortic graft originated either from the distal thoracic aorta (n = 5) or from the juxtarenal aortic stump (n = 10). Follow-up averaged 56 months (range, 7 to 110 months).\nAll patients survived the redo grafting procedure. In the eleven patients who had ischemic symptoms, redo grafting procedures uniformly resulted in symptomatic improvement with an increase in ankle-brachial indexes (0.78 +/- 0.34 vs 0.50 +/- 0.29; p = 0.02). A graft limb occlusion developed in two of these patients (3 and 6 months), but no limbs were amputated. In the four patients who had proven or suspected extraanatomic bypass graft infection, there was one graft limb occlusion (29 months) and one amputation (17 months). Overall, recurrent graft infection occurred in three of 15 patients and may be more frequent in patients who have a proven extraanatomic bypass graft infection (2 of 3 vs 1 of 12; p = 0.08). Infection accounted for two of the three graft limb occlusions and two of the three late deaths. Recurrent infection was not associated with early (< 1 year) regrafting procedures, and culture results did not correlate with the microbiologic features of the primary infection.\nRedo aortic grafting procedures can be performed safely and at relatively early intervals (6 to 12 months) after removal of the infected aortic graft. The procedure reliably relieves ischemic symptoms of the hemodynamically inadequate extraanatomic bypass graft. Reinfection remains a risk after redo aortic grafting procedures, particularly when treating established extraanatomic bypass graft infection.",

    "abstract": "Aneurysms of the splenic artery that anomalously arise from a splenomesenteric trunk are a rarity. Aneurysmal disease of visceral arteries is found in only 0.2% of the general population. The celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) are involved in less than 10% of all visceral aneurysms. Although rupture seems to occur in 20% to 22% of patients, the related mortality rate can rise as high as 100%. Anomalies of the celiac trunk and SMA, more common than previously claimed, include the splenic artery arising from the SMA, which occurs in only 1% of patients. We present two cases of young patients who had 4-cm aneurysms behind the pancreas that involved an anomalous splenic artery. The first patient required dissection of the entire splenopancreatic bloc through a transverse abdominal incision to excise the aneurysm and repair the SMA. The second patient was treated by the classic approach, through a median incision and by entering the mesenteric root. There do not seem to be reports of similar cases, except for two cases of aneurysms involving the celiomesenteric trunk. The cause of these aneurysms can be attributed to mesenchymal alterations during the embryonic formation of aortic collateral branches. A correct surgical approach to splanchnic aneurysms calls for awareness of potential vascular variations of the arteries and their collateral pathways.",

    "abstract": "Iliac artery-ureteral fistula is a rare entity that is being reported with increasing frequency. Patients with iliac artery-ureteral fistulas can be divided into two distinct groups on the basis of the factors that predispose them to having these fistulas. In group I the fistula is associated with degenerative iliac artery disease or previous arterial reconstructive surgery. Patients in group II have undergone some combination of the following procedures: pelvic extirpative surgery for malignancy, urinary diversion, radiation therapy, and ureteral stenting. The diagnosis of an iliac artery-ureteral fistula can be elusive even with the use of multiple imaging methods. Direct operative repair is technically demanding and is associated with high mortality rates. In recent years, treatment has shifted toward percutaneous embolization of the iliac artery and extraanatomic lower extremity vascular reconstruction for group II patients. In this report, the 24 group II patients with iliac artery-ureteral fistulas who previously have been described are reviewed, and a new endovascular treatment for this entity that uses a stented vein graft is detailed.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms are characterized by degradation of the extracellular matrix, induction of endogenous metalloproteinases (MMPs), and development of a chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Despite intensive analysis of end-stage tissue, aneurysm pathogenesis remains obscure. The aim of this study was to develop an in vitro model of aneurysmal disease.\nPorcine aortic organ cultures were preincubated with pancreatic elastase before culture in standard conditions for up to 14 days. The extent of matrix degradation at various time points was determined by quantitative histologic estimation of collagen and elastin concentration. Endogenous metalloproteinase production within the tissue was quantified by gel enzymography and immunoblotting. A separate series of experiments was performed to investigate the effect of incorporating autologous leukocytes into the culture system.\nAlthough exogenous elastase was removed after 24 hours, substantial degradation of the aortic extracellular matrix occurred in the subsequent 13 days in tissue culture. Analysis of samples preincubated with elastase (100 U/ml) for 24 hours before tissue culture demonstrated that elastin degradation occurred in a time-dependent manner (p < 0.001) and was not confined to the initial phase of exogenous elastase activity. Gelatin gel enzymography revealed a time-related production of metalloproteinases (55 to 250 kDa) within the aortic tissue. The presence of MMPs-1, 2, 3, and 9 was determined by immunoblotting. Immunohistochemistry identified the vascular smooth-muscle cell as the source of MMPs-1, 2, and 3. Addition of autogenous leukocytes to elastase-pretreated tissue initiated an inflammatory infiltrate within the aortic wall, which further enhanced both matrix degradation and MMP production (p < 0.001).\nThese data demonstrate that aortic samples pretreated with elastase before tissue culture undergo matrix degradation with MMP production and the development of an inflammatory infiltrate. These changes mirror the pathophysiological events within established aneurysms. It is suggested that this model may be useful in understanding early pathogenic events within aneurysmal tissue.",

The endovascular treatment was performed through a groin incision and consisted of a recanalization of the occluded femoral artery, balloon dilatation, and intraluminal placement of a 3-mm polytetrafluoroethylene graft, distal fixation with a stent, dilation of the graft, and proximal suture anastomosis in the common femoral artery.\nAt a 1-year follow-up the Kaplan-Meier method revealed a primary patency rate of 73.1% (95% confidence limits: 59.6 to 86.6) and a secondary patency rate of 86.3% (range 75.8% to 96.9%). The procedure morbidity rate was 3.6%; the mortality and amputation rate at 12 months was nil.\nThe early 1-year results of this endovascular study support the concept that femoropopliteal endobypass for atherosclerotic occlusive disease may be an acceptable alternative to classic direct femoropopliteal bypass operations.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of patient characteristics, blood rheology, and plasma biochemistry on the outcome of infrainguinal bypass grafting.\nBlood rheology, plasma fibrinogen, cross-linked fibrin degradation products, von Willebrand factor (vWf) and other endothelial products, and clinical variables including smoking markers were determined before surgery in patients with 184 consecutive infrainguinal bypass grafts (90 vein, 94 synthetic grafts).\nFifty (27%) graft occlusions and 17 (9%) deaths occurred within 1 year of surgery. On univariate analysis a poor outcome was associated with elevated preoperative plasma fibrinogen, fibrin degradation products, vWf, and platelet levels, reduced hemoglobin and systolic ankle pressure, a below-knee anastomosis, a decrease in patent calf vessels, and the presence of tissue necrosis (all p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis increased preoperative vWf levels were predictive of poor postoperative outcome (relative hazard for upper quartile versus lower quartile = 1.82), as were a low systolic ankle pressure (relative hazard = 2.51), presence of tissue necrosis (relative hazard = 2.73), and female sex (relative hazard = 1.9). None of the other variables studied was related to outcome. With a preoperative risk score derived from the results, graft patency rates within 3 months of surgery fell to less than 25% with risk scores in the upper quartile.\nPreoperative measurement of plasma vWf may enable more accurate prediction of the outcome of infrainguinal revascularization and when combined with other variables could assist in patient selection for these procedures. The association of vWf with graft occlusion supports a role for endothelial disturbance in graft occlusion.",

This study has addressed the problem with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nTwenty patients (14 men, 6 women) with a median age of 73 years were recruited and assessed according to current endovascular graft selection criteria. Thirteen patients subsequently underwent open aneurysmorrhaphy, and the intraoperative parameters have been compared with those of duplex ultrasonography and MRI.\nNo significant difference was demonstrated in the diameter of the infrarenal neck among ultrasonography, MRI, and intraoperative findings (p > 0.05, Mann Whitney U Test) and also during assessment of infrarenal neck length; however, duplex sonography accurately defined the renal ostia in only five cases. MRI visualized 38 of 40 renal arteries. Distal aortic involvement (cuff diameter and length) and the length and diameter of the common iliac arteries were accurately determined by MRI in all cases, and no significant difference was demonstrated with the intraoperative findings. Comparison of the intraoperative and MRI aneurysm lengths suggested a slight trend of overestimation by MRI resulting from angulation of the aneurysm, but this figure did not reach statistical significance. Only two patients met the current criteria for endoluminal straight grafting.\nBoth MRI and duplex sonography accurately predicted aortic morphologic characteristics; however, MRI provided the most comprehensive anatomic picture for patient selection and should be considered the nonionizing imaging modality of choice when an endovascular repair is being contemplated.",

    "abstract": "Graft procoagulant activity is determined by thrombin (IIa) and activated factor X (Xa) that binds to thrombus. Thrombus-associated factor Xa and thrombin are resistant to antithrombin III-dependent therapy (heparin). To avoid complications and costs associated with systemic administration, we evaluated whether locally applied antithrombotic agents inhibit prosthetic graft procoagulant activity under no-flow and low-flow conditions.\nFour-millimeter-diameter collagen-coated grafts were preclotted in recalcified human plasma, washed, immersed in antithrombotic agents (either 100 nm hirudin, 20 microns D-Phe-L-Pro-L-Arg chloromethylketone, 5 microns tick anticoagulant peptide or 5 or 10 micrograms/ml tissue factor pathway inhibitor) or saline solution, and extensively rewashed. Grafts were exposed to recalcified plasma either in multiwell plates or underwent perfusion at 1 ml/min flow rate. Fibrinopeptide A, which reflects fibrin elaboration, was measured as a marker of thrombin activity.\nInhibitors reduced fibrinopeptide generation at 8 minutes by 55% (tissue factor pathway inhibitor), 57% (hirudin), or 63% (tick anticoagulant peptide and D-Phe-L-Pro-L-Argchloromethylketone) compared with the control agents (p < 0.05). Under low-flow conditions tissue factor pathway inhibitor and hirudin reduced fibrinopeptide generation at 13 minutes by 61% and 49%, respectively, when compared with control agents (p < 0.05).\nGraft-associated inhibitors targeted at factors IIa, Xa, or tissue factor/VIIa/Xa complex effectively reduce procoagulant activity on prosthetic grafts. The success of local application of antithrombotic agents in attenuating early fibrin formation suggests that this strategy could favorably influence acute graft patency, and we speculate these agents may improve long-term graft patency as well.",

The objective of this study was to determine the ability of duplex ultrasonography to adequately evaluate the inferior vena cava (IVC) for size, patency, and the presence of thrombus before Greenfield filter (GF) insertion.\nDuplex ultrasonographic scans were performed in 40 patients who had documented lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis diagnosed by duplex scan before GF placement. The infrarenal transverse and anteroposterior diameters of the IVC were measured, and the entire IVC was imaged for patency and the presence of thrombus or anomalies. Preoperative venacavograms were not obtained in any patients who had GFs placed in the operating room, but was performed during surgery during filter insertion. An additional 26 patients who had deep venous thrombosis and did not have caval interruption underwent IVC duplex to determine the patency and proximal extent of venous thrombosis.\nThe indications for GF placement were contraindication to anticoagulation in 72.5% (29 patients); five filters were placed prophylactically; three for failure of anticoagulation; two after a complication of anticoagulation; and one before pulmonary embolectomy. The filters were placed in the operating room by surgeons in 82.5% of patients, with the remainder inserted in an angiography suite by an interventional radiologist. The ability of duplex to measure a transverse diameter of 26 mm or less had a sensitivity of 97.5%, positive predictive value of 100%, and overall accuracy of 97.5% using venacavography as the standard. Measurements of IVC diameter by duplex correlated with those based on venacavograms (r = 0.766; p < 0.001). Of the entire group of 66 IVC duplex examinations, one (1.5%) was incomplete because of technical limitations. IVC thrombus was noted by duplex in two patients who underwent GF insertion, which was confirmed with venacavography. No IVC anomalies were noted by duplex scans or venacavograms.\nDuplex ultrasonography is a useful and accurate method for assessment of the IVC before vena cava filter placement.",

IVC thrombus was noted by duplex in two patients who underwent GF insertion, which was confirmed with venacavography. No IVC anomalies were noted by duplex scans or venacavograms.",

    "abstract": "This article reviews our experience with internal carotid artery dissection (ICAD), evaluates the usefulness of Duplex scanning in diagnosis, provides current recommendations for treatment, and better defines long-term prognosis.\nThe records from 1976 to 1995 of 24 patients who had 28 ICAD were reviewed. All diagnoses were confirmed by arteriography. Presenting symptoms, diagnostic tests, clinical management, and outcome were examined.\nNine patients had visual symptoms or headache, 10 had transient focal neurologic symptoms (TIA), and five had stroke. Five of the 19 who had visual symptoms or TIA had a stroke before the diagnosis of ICAD. Seventeen patients who had 19 ICAD underwent a Duplex scan at the time of presentation. Duplex scan identified 18 arterial abnormalities consistent with ICAD (sensitivity, 95%). Three patients died from stroke during the initial hospitalization. Of the 21 who survived, 12 were treated with anticoagulation therapy, six with aspirin, and three with aspirin and anticoagulation therapy. None of the 21 patients had a subsequent stroke. Six patients subsequently had an operation for residual occlusive disease or aneurysm. The mean duration of follow-up was 9.3 years. Two patients developed contralateral ICAD. During follow-up, 19 arteries were studied with Duplex scan, and seven had no residual evidence of ICAD.\nPatients who have ICAD often have prodromal symptoms before stroke. If diagnosed early, treatment with anticoagulation may prevent stroke. Duplex scans are accurate for defining carotid abnormalities consistent with ICAD and for indicating the need for arteriography. Patients should undergo a follow-up Duplex scan to identify contralateral ICAD.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to examine the relationship between intraoperative color-flow duplex (CFD) findings and the development of restenosis in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA).\nSeventy-eight patients (43 male and 35 female; mean age, 65 years) underwent 86 CEAs (eight staged bilateral) and intraoperative CFD during a 31-month period. Three patients (three CEAs, 3%) underwent both CFD and a completion arteriographic scan. Patients were observed in a postoperative protocol using CFD surveillance. The follow-up interval ranged from 6 to 24 months (average, 12 months).\nAfter undergoing CEA, 10 patients (10 CEAs, 11%) had an abnormality detected by intraoperative CFD; one was confirmed with a completion arteriographic scan. These abnormalities consisted of elevated peak systolic velocities (PSV) with a mosaic color pattern suggesting turbulence seen in six CEAs, including one internal carotid artery (ICA) with abnormal hemodynamics and an unremarkable completion arteriogram. Intimal defects on B-mode were seen in another four CEAs. These carotid arteries were reexplored, defects (intimal flaps with platelet thrombus) were confirmed by direct examination, and all were repaired with or without a patch (six ICAs, three external carotid arteries, and one common carotid artery). No cerebrovascular events occurred in the perioperative period. No carotid restenosis (> or = 50% diameter reduction) was identified during follow-up of 43 patients (48 CEAs, 56%). Two patients had recurrent neurologic symptoms.\nIntraoperative CFD is an effective test for detecting flow abnormalities or intimal defects in patients undergoing CEA. Ensuring normal intraoperative hemodynamics after CEA may be a major factor associated with decreased incidence of perioperative cerebrovascular events and subsequent carotid artery restenosis.",

    "abstract": "The Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) indicated significant benefit from endarterectomy compared with medical therapy for patients with 60% to 99% asymptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenoses. To date, optimal selection of patients for vascular laboratory follow-up to determine progression from < 60% to > or = 60% asymptomatic ICA stenosis is unknown. To determine which patients with < 60% asymptomatic ICA stenoses are at greatest risk for short-term progression to > or = 60% without symptoms, we reviewed vascular laboratory results and clinical risk factors of consecutive patients who were prospectively observed in a study of atherosclerosis progression.\nCarotid duplex studies were obtained every 6 months and were reviewed for progression from < 60% to > or = 60% asymptomatic ICA stenosis by using criteria that were developed and reported by our laboratory. Clinical risk factors and velocities from initial duplex scans were analyzed for association with progression from < 60% to > or = 60% ICA stenoses without symptoms.\nTwo hundred sixty-three patients (mean age, 66 years) with 434 asymptomatic < 60% ICA stenoses were prospectively observed for a mean of 20 months, with a mean of four examinations per patient. Seventeen patients (6.5%) and 18 ICAs (4%) progressed without symptoms to > or = 60% ICA stenoses at a mean of 18 months. Clinical risk factors associated with progression to > or = 60% asymptomatic ICA stenosis included elevated systolic blood pressure and decreased ankle-brachial index (p = 0.05). The mean initial ICA peak systolic velocity (PSV) in ICAs that progressed to > or = 60% asymptomatic stenoses was 180 cm/sec, compared with 104 cm/sec in asymptomatic ICAs that did not progress to > or = 60% (p = 0.0003). Thirty-one percent of asymptomatic ICAs that had initial PSVs of 175 cm/sec or greater progressed to > or = 60% stenosis, whereas only 1.8% that had initial PSVs less than 175 cm/sec progressed to > or = 60% asymptomatic stenoses (p < 0.001). The life-table-determined rate of freedom from progression to > or = 60% stenosis was 94% at 4 years for asymptomatic ICA lesions that had initial PSVs less than 175 cm/sec, compared with 14% at 3 years for lesions that had initial PSVs > or = 175 cm/sec.\nEarly progression from < 60% asymptomatic ICA stenoses to > or = 60% asymptomatic ICA stenoses occurs infrequently. Patients who are at the greatest risk of early progression without symptoms to an ACAS-positive lesion can be identified from the ICA PSV at their initial duplex examination. Early vascular laboratory follow-up of asymptomatic ICA stenoses may be limited to a relatively small group.",

    "abstract": "The recently published Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) demonstrated the benefit of performing carotid endarterectomy in selected asymptomatic patients who have > 60% carotid stenoses. It therefore becomes clinically important to identify the subgroups of patients who have a sufficiently high incidence of high-grade carotid stenosis to warrant routine carotid duplex screening.\nTo determine the incidence of asymptomatic carotid disease in patients who had a chief complaint of claudication, we evaluated 188 patients who had claudication and no history of cerebrovascular symptoms. After a complete history was taken and a physical examination performed, patients underwent standard lower-extremity noninvasive vascular laboratory studies and carotid duplex scanning. Carotid duplex findings were interpreted by the Strandness criteria. Associated atherosclerotic risk factors were assessed (patient age, male sex, diabetes, hypertension, smoking history, lipid levels, history of coronary artery disease, coronary or vascular surgery, and family history of cerebrovascular disease). Presence of a carotid bruit was also noted. Univariate analysis, logistic regression, and odds ratios were performed to identify subgroups of patients that had an increased incidence of significant carotid disease.\nOf the 188 patients with claudication who were screened, 8% had an internal carotid artery stenosis of 16% to 49%, 21.8% had a stenosis that exceeded 50%, and 2.7% had an occluded internal carotid artery. The presence of a carotid bruit on physical examination was predictive of a > or = 50% internal carotid artery stenosis (p = 0.027). The ankle-brachial index was highly predictive of the presence of carotid stenoses in an inverse relationship (p = 0.001). Patient age approached significance (p = 0.143). Patients older than 65 years of age who had claudication, an ankle-brachial index less than 0.7, and a carotid bruit had a 45% incidence of significant carotid disease. The atherosclerotic risk factors of male sex, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking history, coronary history, previous coronary or vascular surgical history, and family history were not predictive of the presence of a > 50% carotid stenosis.\nIn patients who seek medical attention with the chief complaint of claudication and who have no cerebrovascular symptoms, there is a 24.5% incidence of a > 50% internal carotid artery stenosis or occlusion on duplex examination. Select subsets of these patients have upwards of a 45% incidence of significant asymptomatic carotid disease. All patients who seek medical attention with claudication should therefore undergo routine carotid duplex screening to detect asymptomatic high-grade stenosis.",

    "abstract": "This report reviews our preliminary experience of prospective treatment of arterial lesions with endoluminal grafts in a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, investigator-sponsored Investigation Device Exemptions study. The utility and accuracy of various imaging methods, including angiography, cinefluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS), and duplex scanning, in performing the procedures was also assessed.\nThirty-one patients were evaluated; 17 patients were treated, including 11 with abdominal aortic aneurysms, one with an aortic occlusive lesion, two with iliac artery aneurysms, and three with traumatic arteriovenous fistulas. Twelve of the 14 patients who had aorta and iliac artery lesions were high-risk. The mean follow-up of patients treated was 9 months (range, 6 to 15 months).\nAortoaortic endoluminal interposition procedures were not successful for treating abdominal aortic aneurysms early in the study (n = 3). Aortoiliac endoluminal bypass, contralateral iliac artery occlusion, and femorofemoral bypass procedures were successful in seven of eight subsequent cases (88%), with no incidence of endoleaks at either the proximal or distal fixation sites using the deployment methods described in this report. The 30-day operative mortality rate on follow-up evaluations for patients who underwent aortoiliac procedures was 14% (two of 14). Other major complications included transient renal failure in three patients that required short-term (two to eight times) dialysis, one arterial perforation and one dissection, and one prolonged intubation. No myocardial infarctions or strokes occurred. After major complications or identification of limitations in the study, the protocol was modified with the approval of the FDA to help avoid the recurrence of the same problems. There were no deaths or complications in the trauma cases.\nContrast-enhanced CT (axial images and spiral reconstructions) was the most accurate method to determine candidacy for aortoiliac procedures and to choose the site for deployment of the devices. Angiographic scans were misleading in several patients regarding the critical determinants of patient candidacy and device deployment, particularly regarding the presence of a distal aortic neck. Cinefluoroscopy was used in all patient and was particularly useful for determining the continuity of vascular structures and the anatomy of branch arteries and for enabling precise positioning of stent devices. Determination of fixation sites and assessing dimensional information by cinefluoroscopy and angiography were limited by inaccuracies produced by image magnification, parallax, and uniplanar views. IVUS was used to determine the morphologic features of vascular structures (i.e., calcium, thrombus), to perform real-time observation of the expansion of devices, and to assure firm fixation of balloon-expanded stents before the procedures were completed. Duplex scanning was very helpful in assessing and identifying precisely the location of arteriovenous fistulas before intervention and provided assessment at follow-up intervals. Three-dimensional reconstruction imaging technologies such as spiral CT were particularly helpful for assessing the morphologic features of vascular anatomy before the intervention and at follow-up intervals, whereas 3-D IVUS provided a similar real-time perspective during the procedure.",

Aortoiliac endoluminal bypass, contralateral iliac artery occlusion, and femorofemoral bypass procedures were successful in seven of eight subsequent cases (88%), with no incidence of endoleaks at either the proximal or distal fixation sites using the deployment methods described in this report. The 30-day operative mortality rate on follow-up evaluations for patients who underwent aortoiliac procedures was 14% (two of 14). Other major complications included transient renal failure in three patients that required short-term (two to eight times) dialysis, one arterial perforation and one dissection, and one prolonged intubation. No myocardial infarctions or strokes occurred. After major complications or identification of limitations in the study, the protocol was modified with the approval of the FDA to help avoid the recurrence of the same problems. There were no deaths or complications in the trauma cases.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to determine the primary patency, foot salvage, and complication rates associated with iliac artery stent deployment.\nFrom March 1992 to May 1995, 147 iliac artery stents were deployed in 98 limbs of 72 patients for disabling claudication or limb-threatening ischemia. Procedure-related and late (> 30 days) complications, as well as adjunctive maneuvers required to correct a complication, were tabulated. Stented iliac artery cumulative primary patency and foot salvage rates were calculated with life-table analysis. Factors that impacted early complications, late complications, foot salvage rates, and stented iliac artery primary patency rates were identified with stepwise logistic regression analysis.\nA procedure-related complication occurred in 19 (19.4%) limbs. Initial technical success, however, was achieved in all but three of 98 limbs (96.9%). Stented iliac artery cumulative primary patency rates were 87.6%, 61.9%, 55.3%, and foot salvage rates were 97.7%, 85.1%, 76.1%, at 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively. External iliac artery stent deployment, superficial femoral artery occlusion before treatment, and single-vessel tibial runoff before treatment negatively affected stented iliac artery cumulative primary patency rates. Stented iliac artery primary patency rates were not significantly affected by age, smoking, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, presenting symptom, early complication, number of stents deployed, type of stent deployed, or stent deployment for stenosis versus occlusion.\nLimb-threatening and life-threatening complications can be associated with iliac artery stent deployment. Stented iliac artery primary patency rates are affected by distal atherosclerotic occlusive disease and the position of the deployed stent within the iliac system. Stent reconstruction of severe iliac artery occlusive disease is feasible but should be thoughtfully selected.",

    "abstract": "Despite intense investigation of angiogenesis, little effort has been made to exploit this phenomenon in ischemic tissue. The few studies on this topic have focused primarily on the development of collateral arteries in existing arterial beds. A previous study showed that a perfused muscle flap transposed to an ischemic limb formed vascular connections, which were demonstrated with angiography, between the arteries of the flap and the limb vasculature. Microsphere studies suggested that these vascular connections increased the resting perfusion of the ischemic limb. This study is designed to confirm histologically that such connections develop and to quantitate the number and dimensions of these new vessels.\nThrough a midline laparotomy, the right common iliac artery was ligated and divided in 18 male New Zealand white rabbits. An abdominal-wall muscle flap based on the left inferior epigastric artery was transposed to the right thigh. On the seventh day, contrast dye was injected into the flap artery of eight rabbits and an arteriogram was obtained. The tissue of the remaining rabbits was perfusion-fixed at 3 days (n = 2), 7 days (n = 4), and 14 days (n = 4). Thin sections of the flap-thigh muscle interface were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and for alpha-actin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen and were examined microscopically.\nAn arteriogram confirmed vascular connections between the flap and the native limb circulation in seven of the eight rabbits. Histologic evaluation of the flap-thigh muscle interface showed no new vessels on the third day. On the seventh day, 6.8 +/- 4.8 new vessels (positive alpha-actin staining, red blood cells in lumen) were seen per 40 x field; the vessels averaged 10.2 +/- 5.2 microns in diameter. On the fourteenth day, there were 7.3 +/- 3.8 vessels per 40 x field (p = 0.46), but the vessel diameter increased to 20.7 +/- 10.6 microns (p = 0.013). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining confirmed that these were proliferating vessels.\nWithin seven days, new vessels that were more mature than capillaries (stained for alpha-actin, a smooth muscle cell protein) formed between the flap and the thigh muscle. These new connecting vessels continue to enlarge in diameter between 7 and 14 days, but the stimulus to form new vessels appeared to decline or disappear before the fourteenth day. Attempts to sustain this phenomenon with angiogenic factors are underway.",

    "abstract": "The antiphospholipid antibodies (APL)-anticardiolipin antibodies (ACL) and lupus anticoagulant (LA)-are widely believed to be associated with decreased lower extremity bypass graft patency rates. To date, no prospective cohort study has confirmed this assumption. A prospective comparison of the result of infrainguinal revascularization procedures performed since 1990 in patients with and without APL forms the basis of this report.\nPatients who underwent elective infrainguinal bypass procedures from 1990 to 1994 were evaluated for hypercoagulable states (ACL, LA, protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III). Patient data were prospectively entered in a computerized vascular registry, and postoperative follow-up was maintained for life. Graft patency, limb salvage, and patient survival rates were calculated by life-table methods.\nThree hundred twenty-seven lower extremity bypass grafting procedures were performed in 262 patients. APLs were present in 83 patients (32%); 70 patients (84%) had ACLs only, 11 patients (13%) had LA only, and two patients (3%) had both ACLs and LA. There was no significant difference between APL-positive and APL-negative patients with respect to demographics, associated medical conditions, indication for operations, and type of procedures performed. More patients who had APLs had warfarin treatment after surgery (43% vs 24%, p = 0.002). Life table 4-year primary patency rates showed minimal difference (APL-positive, 43%; APL-negative, 59%; p = 0.087), and no significant difference was noted in assisted primary patency rates (APL positive, 72%; APL negative, 73%; p = NS), limb salvage rates (APL positive, 79%; APL negative, 88%; p = NS), and patient survival rates (APL positive, 67%; APL negative, 66%; p = NS).\nAPLs were found in a surprising one third of the patients who underwent leg bypass grafting procedures. The majority of APLs identified were ACLs (87%). There was minimal difference in graft primary patency rates, and no difference in assisted primary patency, limb salvage, and survival rates between patients with and without APLs who underwent leg bypass grafting procedures. The extreme morbidity rate associated with APLs in previous reports is not confirmed by this prospective study. APLs should not be regarded as a contraindication to indicated leg bypass grafting procedures.",

    "abstract": "Early results of a prospective study that compared surgical revascularization and thrombolysis for lower extremity arterial and graft occlusions have been published. This report details the final results in patients who have native artery occlusions.\nTwo hundred thirty-seven patients who had lower extremity ischemia as a result of iliac-common femoral (IF; 69 patients) or superficial femoral-popliteal (FP; 168 patients) occlusion, and had symptomatically deteriorated within the past 6 months were randomized to catheter-directed thrombolysis (150 patients) or surgical revascularization (87 patients). After diagnostic arteriographic examination but before randomization, the optimal surgical procedure was determined. Lytic patients were randomized to recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA; 84 patients) or urokinase (UK; 66 patients). Recurrent ischemia, morbidity, amputation, and death rates were determined at 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year, and were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis.\nFor patients randomized to lysis, a catheter was properly positioned and the lytic agent delivered in 78%. This provided a reduction in the predetermined surgical procedure in 58% of patients who had an FP occlusion and 51% of those who had an IF occlusion. rt-PA and UK were equally effective and safe, but lysis time was shorter with rt-PA (8 vs 24 hr; p < 0.05). At 1 year, the incidence of recurrent ischemia (64% vs 35%; p < 0.0001) and major amputation (10% vs 0%; p = 0.0024) was increased in patients who were randomized to lysis. Factors associated with a poor lytic outcome included FP occlusion, diabetes, and critical ischemia. No differences in mortality rates were observed at 1 year between the lysis and surgical groups.\nSurgical revascularization for lower extremity native artery occlusions is more effective and durable than thrombolysis. Thrombolysis used initially provides a reduction in the surgical procedure for a majority of patients; however, long-term outcome is inferior, particularly for patients who have an FP occlusion, diabetes, or critical ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Claudication patients' perceptions of walking impairment often influence recommendations for peripheral bypass and angioplasty. The actual relationship between lower extremity blood flow and physical functioning, however, has rarely been explicitly studied.\nPatients were enrolled at a visit to one of 16 vascular surgery offices and clinics that participated in a prospective outcomes study. A total of 555 patients (445 men and 110 women) with an abnormal ankle-brachial index (ABI), none of whom had had previous leg revascularization or symptoms of rest pain, skin ulcers, or gangrene, completed the SF36 Health Survey and the Peripheral Arterial Disease Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ). Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to test the statistical significance and strength of association between patients' ABI level and SF36 physical functioning (PF) and WIQ community walking distance scores, controlled for sociodemographic characteristics and the presence and severity of comorbid conditions.\nUnivariate correlations with ABI were modest but significant (PF score, r = 0.12, p = 0.004; WIQ distance score, r = 0.18, p < 0.001). ABI was a very significant predictor of both PF (b = 18.8; p = 0.001) and WIQ scores (b = 0.33; p < 0.0001) in the multiple regression analysis. Other positive predictors of PF scores were high-school graduation and male sex. Negative predictors of PF scores were heart, lung, and cerebrovascular disease; knee arthritis and chronic back pain; and enrollment at a Veterans Administration clinic rather than a private community or academic office.\nCross-sectional findings indicate that a 0.3 improvement in ABI is associated with an average improvement of 5.6% in PF or 10.3% in WIQ distance score. However, proper selection of individual candidates for interventional therapy, that is, those patients who have lower ABIs, lower initial functioning, and fewer disabling comorbidities would be predicted to produce a much greater functional benefit. Surgeons should make a rigorous functional evaluation when recommending interventional management of claudication.",

ABI was a very significant predictor of both PF (b = 18.8; p = 0.001) and WIQ scores (b = 0.33; p < 0.0001) in the multiple regression analysis. Other positive predictors of PF scores were high-school graduation and male sex. Negative predictors of PF scores were heart, lung, and cerebrovascular disease; knee arthritis and chronic back pain; and enrollment at a Veterans Administration clinic rather than a private community or academic office.",

    "abstract": "An endothelialized lumen within a synthetic graft that expresses recombinant proteins with anticoagulant or antiproliferative activity has the potential to improve graft function. However, preliminary data suggest that genetic modification of endothelial cells (ECs) impairs their proliferation. The purpose of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that retroviral transduction of cultured ECs with the lac Z gene encoding for beta-galactosidase would decrease EC proliferation in vitro and graft endothelialization in vivo.\nIn vitro studies compared canine EC proliferation over a 14-day period among early-passage ECs (two and three) and late-passage ECs (six and nine) transduced with the BAG vector (containing the lac Z gene and the neomycin resistance gene), ECs transduced with the neomycin resistance gene only, the nontransduced ECs. In vivo canine studies assessed endothelialization of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene thoracoabdominal grafts seeded with autologous lac Z-transduced ECs (n = 7) or nontransduced ECs (n = 3) compared with that of nonseeded grafts (n = 3). Histochemical staining and DNA polymerase chain reaction was used 6 weeks after implantation to detect the presence of the lac Z gene in the grafts' cellular linings and perigraft tissues. Endothelialization was assessed by light microscopy and electron microscopy.\nProliferation of late-passage lac Z-transduced ECs in vitro was significantly decreased compared with neomycin resistance-transduced ECs or nontransduced ECs. Among early-passage ECs smaller but significant decreases in proliferation were noted among lac Z-transduced cells compared with nontransduced cells. Six of seven expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts seeded with transduced ECs showed lac Z gene expression. Lac Z gene expression was not found on grafts seeded with nontransduced ECs or nonseeded grafts. The endothelialized luminal surface area was significantly less in grafts seeded with lac Z-transduced ECs compared with grafts seeded with nontransduced ECs.\nRetroviral-mediated transduction of canine ECs with the lac Z gene encoding for beta-galactosidase impairs EC proliferation in vitro and the ability of transduced ECs to form a confluent EC monolayer on the luminal surface of synthetic grafts in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The vascular smooth muscle cell plays a pivotal role in the development of atherosclerosis. The objectives of this study were to characterize smooth muscle cells from the human atherosclerotic tibial artery to determine their phenotypic properties and to examine the contractile reactions of these cells to physiologic and pharmacologic stimuli.\nAfter below-knee amputations were performed, vascular smooth muscle cells were harvested and cultivated from tibioperoneal source. Characterization was done with transmission electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry. The contractile properties were determined by observing the response to various stimuli. In addition, segments of vessels harvested were submitted to electron microscopy studies for comparison with the cultured cells.\nImmunofluorescent labeling was positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of a thickened basal laminae and large intracellular lipid vacuoles. The earlier passages revealed cells with a large number of microfilaments characteristic of a contractile cell. As later passages were examined, there was a notable change in character with an increasing amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complexes. The increased thickness of the basal lamina in the cultured cells resembled that found in vessel segments studied by electron microscopy. A rapid contraction response was seen when the cells were incubated with angiotensin II, bradykinin, or endothelin. No response was seen with the addition of isoproterenol, nitroglycerin, or nitroprusside, known smooth-muscle relaxants.\nThis model demonstrates the apparent inability of these smooth muscle cells from atherosclerotic tibial arteries to relax to pharmacologic and physiologic stimuli. In addition, as seen by transmission electron microscopy, these cells maintain their atherosclerotic phenotype after multiple passages.",

    "abstract": "Cryopreserved arterial allografts may be used for arterial reconstructive procedures. In this experimental study cryopreserved arteries were used as autografts and as allografts with or without immunosuppression with cyclosporine A.\nIn group A (three dogs, six bilateral grafts) cryopreserved carotid artery autografts were implanted. In groups B and C female mongrel dogs (three dogs and six bilateral grafts in each group) received cryopreserved male carotid artery allografts. Dogs in group C were treated with cyclosporine A (25 mg/kg/day). After 3 months of implantation patency was assessed by angiography. Contractile responses to KCl and phenylephrine (Phe) and the endothelium-dependent relaxation response to methacholine (Met) were examined in segments of the grafts after excision. Medial thickness was assessed semiquantitatively. The grafts were stained for sex chromatin analysis to determine the origin of cells in allografts.\nPatency: group A, 100% (6 of 6), group B, 66.6% (4 of 6), and group C, 100% (6 of 6). Functional responses: before implantation, after thawing, 2.7 +/- 0.5 mN (KCl), 4.8 +/- 1.0 mN (Phe), and 0.0% +/- 0.0% (Met), group A, 36.9 +/- 10.6 mN (KCl), 31.5 +/- 14.4 mN (Phe), and 59.3% +/- 20.4% (Met), group B, 0 for all agents used, group C, 34.0 +/- 7.5 mN (KCl), 28.8 +/- 7.0 mN (Phe), and 46.2% +/- 3.2% (Met). Morphologic characteristics: the media of grafts in group B showed significant thinning (p < 0.05). Smooth-muscle cells in vessel walls of grafts in group C were of female origin.\nArteries showed no function and loss of endothelial integrity after cryopreservation and thawing. After 3 months of implantation cryopreserved arterial autografts and allografts under immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporine A showed 100% patency and return of functional responses resulting from repopulation of grafts by host cells.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the variation in ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) measurements in routine clinical practice.\nAnalysis was done of preoperative and postoperative ABPIs in 130 limbs contralateral to those undergoing femoral bypass grafting in 123 patients over a 15-month period.\nThe mean initial ABPI was 0.72 (range 0.22 to 1.10). The range of observed differences between the preoperative and postoperative ABPIs was from -0.33 to +0.25. The mean (+/-SD) difference between the first and second ABPIs was 0.00 (+/-0.11). The 95% confidence limits of the difference were -0.21 to 0.21. There was no trend for the size or direction of the difference in ABPI to vary according to the mean ABPI, brachial blood pressure, or time between tests.\nABPI is routinely used as an objective measure of peripheral vascular disease. The variation observed in this study is comparable with values obtained in reproducibility studies and is greater than that accepted in clinical practice. The difference between an ABPI measurement and the actual ABPI and the difference between repeat single measurements are not the same and should be distinguished. Vascular laboratories should determine the accuracy of ABPI measurement on a local basis to guarantee and maintain quality assurance.",

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that preincubation of whole blood clots with recombinants tissue factor pathway inhibitor (rTFPI) attenuates clot-associated procoagulant activity assessed ex vivo. This study was undertaken to determine whether a single local application of rTFPI induces similar attenuation of the procoagulant activity on preclotted Dacron grafts implanted in an artery in vivo.\nDacron grafts (4 mm x 4 cm long) were preclotted in porcine blood and incubated with either rTFPI (5 mg/ml) or arginine-phosphate buffer for 15 minutes. Grafts were implanted end-to-end in the femoral arteries of 10 pigs, with one rTFPI-treated and one buffer-treated graft implanted in each animal. Animals did not undergo anticoagulation either before or after graft implantation. Radiolabeled porcine fibrinogen was injected intravenously, and the grafts underwent perfusion for 1 hour. A subgroup of animals (n = 7) also had infusion of radiolabeled autologous platelets at the time of administration of radiolabeled fibrinogen.\nFibrin(ogen) deposition was decreased in rTFPI-treated grafts by 36% +/- 7% (mean +/- SEM) compared with buffer-treated grafts (p = 0.001). Platelet deposition was also reduced in the rTFPI-treated grafts by 31% +/- 15%, although the reduction did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.10). The extent of rTFPI-mediated attenuation of fibrin(ogen) versus platelet deposition varied independently among animals.\nClot-directed anticoagulant effects of rTFPI appear to be useful for substantially decreasing the thrombogenicity of Dacron grafts immediately after their implantation. Chronic studies to determine whether the decreases in thrombogenicity result in improved long-term graft patency appear warranted.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the carotid duplex criteria for a > or = 60% angiographic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis and the degree of variation among duplex scanners.\nCarotid duplex criteria for a > or = 60% angiographic stenosis were evaluated in two ICAVL-accredited vascular laboratories with different brands of duplex scanners (Siemens-Quantum and Diasonics in Laboratory A, ATL and Diasonics in Laboratory B). Analysis was performed for 360 carotid bifurcations in 180 consecutive patients who had concurrent angiographic and duplex evaluation. Blinded angiogram evaluation was performed with precision electronic calipers on magnified views, with stenosis calculated by criteria of the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study and the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. Duplex data included internal carotid artery peak systolic velocity (ICA PSV), ICA end-diastolic velocity, and the ratio of ICA PSV to common carotid artery (CCA) PSV (ICA/CCA ratio).\nThe most accurate determination of a > or = 60% ICA stenosis was obtained with ICA/CCA ratio and ICA PSV, but the optimal threshold differed for all four scanners. The optimal ICA/CCA ratio varied from 2.6 to 3.3, and the optimal ICA PSV varied from 190 to 240 cm/sec. All four scanners produced criteria that give a positive predictive value > 90% while maintaining accuracy at > or = 90%. Logarithmic transformation of duplex variables created a linear relationship between duplex values and angiographic stenosis, allowing statistical evaluation of scanner operating characteristics by linear regression analysis and analysis of covariance. This analysis revealed that the mathematic equation relating duplex values with angiographic percent stenosis was statistically different for one of the four scanners (p < 0.05). Scanner differences did not appear to be due to technologists, because the regression lines were nearly identical for the two Diasonics scanners despite use by different technologists. Ignoring the significant difference in operating characteristics for one of the four scanners would result in a mean error for predicting a 60% stenosis of 14% to 18% (equating a 46% or 78% stenosis with a 60% stenosis).\nWe conclude that the correlation of duplex data with angiographic percent stenosis and the duplex criteria for a > or = 60% stenosis are machine-specific. Regression analysis can determine whether apparent differences are due to chance or significant differences in scanner characteristics. Future studies should include regression analysis according to equipment type.",

A 10-year experience with 831 patients undergoing this procedure was reviewed.\nFrom 1984 to 1994, 831 (761 elective, 70 urgent) of 1103 patients being treated for abdominal aortic aneurysm underwent repair with the retroperitoneal exclusion technique. Perioperative morbidity and mortality, estimated blood loss, transfusion requirements, natural history of the excluded aneurysm sac, and long-term survival were all assessed.\nThe operative mortality rate for patients undergoing exclusion and bypass was 3.4%. The incidence of nonfatal perioperative complications was 5.2%. Colon ischemia requiring resection occurred in 2 (0.2%) of the 831 patients. Estimated blood loss was 638 +/- 557 cc (50 to 330 cc). On follow-up 17 (2%) patients were found to have patent aneurysm sacs as detected by duplex examination. Fourteen patients required surgical intervention. No cases of graft infection or aortoenteric fistula have been noted.\nRetroperitoneal exclusion and bypass is a viable alternative to traditional open endoaneurysmorraphy in surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Most excluded aneurysm sacs have thrombosis without any long- or short-term complications; however, in a small number of patients delayed rupture of patent aneurysm occurs, thus emphasizing the need for diligent follow-up and appropriate intervention.",

    "abstract": "Fogarty balloon denudation in experimental animals often serves as a model for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). We compared the healing response of the arterial wall with the use of Fogarty and PTCA balloon dilation.\nCarotid arteries of rabbits were injured with a 2F Fogarty (n = 9) or a 3 mm PTCA balloon (n = 6). At 1 day endothelial cell removal was qualitatively evaluated in Fogarty balloon lesions and in PTCA balloon lesions with a modified \"en face\" silver nitrate staining. Medial necrosis was morphometrically determined as percentage medial area. After 21 days endothelial cell coverage was assessed in the center of the lesion with an antibody to CD31 and intimal proliferation with an antibody to the nuclear antigen Ki-67. Intimal hyperplasia area was measured with morphometry. Acute lumen gain directly after Fogarty balloon dilation and PTCA balloon dilation was determined by serial angiography. All data are means +/- SEM.\nAt 21 days intimal hyperplasia area was higher in the Fogarty balloon lesions than in the PTCA balloon lesions. Intimal hyperplasia area was 0.19 +/- 0.02 mm2 and 0.03 +/- 0.01 mm2, respectively. Immediately after injury the acute gain in luminal diameter did not differ between Fogarty and PTCA balloon dilation (0.37 +/- 0.03 mm and 0.38 +/- 0.05 mm, respectively). At 1 day after injury endothelial cell removal was complete in all segments. Medial necrosis caused by Fogarty (67% +/- 7%) and PTCA balloon dilation (74% +/- 9%) did not differ. At 21 days endothelial cell coverage was almost complete both in the Fogarty balloon lesions and in the PTCA balloon lesions. Intimal proliferation was also higher in the Fogarty balloon lesions than in the PTCA balloon lesions.\nDespite comparable endothelial cell abrasion and medial necrosis, Fogarty balloon injury elicited significantly augmented intimal hyperplasia compared with PTCA balloon dilation.",

    "abstract": "Transesophageal echocardiography provides detailed images of the thoracic aorta, but imaging of the abdominal aorta and its branches does not occur routinely when the transesophageal echocardiography transducer is advanced into the stomach. Transgastric aortic ultrasonography (TAUS) was investigated as an intraoperative procedure to determine whether transgastric imaging of the abdominal aortic, mesenteric, and renal arteries could be obtained and whether pathologic lesions of these arteries could be identified.\nTwelve patients with diagnoses of aortic aneurysmal or occlusive disease, chronic mesenteric ischemia, or renal artery stenosis that required operative treatment were examined. Preoperative transabdominal duplex imaging was performed in all 12 patients. Transgastric B-mode and color-flow ultrasonography of the abdominal aorta and branches was performed as an intraoperative procedure with the patients under general anesthesia. After the abdomen was opened but before the vascular reconstruction was performed, the transesophageal transducer was advanced into the stomach and directed by the surgeon's hand to obtain an image of the underlying aorta and branches. TAUS images were compared with those obtained by standard transabdominal duplex imaging.\nTAUS provided high-resolution images of both aneurysmal and occlusive aortic disease. In all 12 cases the images of the aortic lumen, plaque, and thrombus obtained with TAUS had greater detail and better resolution than those obtained with transabdominal duplex imaging. The origins of the renal arteries were seen with TAUS in 23 of 24 cases, whereas transabdominal ultrasonography obtained images of the origins in only 6 of 24 cases (p < 0.01).

    "abstract": "Neointimal hyperplasia frequently develops after placement of prosthetic vascular grafts and is a major cause of graft failure. This study was an attempt to prevent vascular lesion formation by coating the graft luminal surface with a thin layer of nonporous silicone polymer, and subsequently with an ultrathin layer of vapor phase (plasma gas)-deposited fluoropolymer, thereby providing a smooth and chemically uniform surface that was postulated to limit pannus tissue ingrowth across the graft anastomoses.\nBilateral femoral arteriovenous (AV) conduits were constructed in four dogs using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft materials (ePTFE; 6-mm inside diameter, 2.5-cm long). In each animal, one femoral AV shunt was constructed from a graft whose luminal surface was entirely coated with polymer. On the contralateral side, an uncoated graft served as a control. Bilateral aortoiliac grafts were placed in three baboons using 5-cm segments of ePTFE (4-mm inside diameter). One end (1 cm) of each graft had been coated with polymer. In each animal, the coated end of one graft was placed proximally and the coated end of the second graft was placed distally in the contralateral vessels.\nAll grafts were patent at 30 days. In the dog model, there was a significant reduction in graft neointimal area at the venous anastomoses for the coated grafts compared with the uncoated grafts (0.03 +/- 0.02 mm2 and 1.11 +/- 0.54 mm2, respectively; p < 0.05). In the baboon model, the silicone coating significantly reduced the graft neointimal thickness (0.003 +/- 0.003 mm vs 0.21 +/- 0.05 mm; p < 0.05) and neointimal area (0.05 +/- 0.08 mm2 vs 0.82 +/- 0.58 mm2; p < 0.05).\nThese data demonstrate that healing of ePTFE grafts can be effectively modified by altering the physical properties of the graft surface. Neointimal hyperplasia within ePTFE grafts is significantly reduced by the local application of a fluorocarbon-coated, silicone-based polymer. The resulting graft flow surface effectively prevents tissue ingrowth from the adjacent native vessel, thereby preserving the anastomosis luminal area. This approach could represent a new strategy for limiting graft surface anastomotic neointimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms of venous outflow from the leg and foot have not been clearly defined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anatomy and physiologic mechanism of the plantar venous plexus and its impact on venous drainage from the tibial veins.\nFifty phlebograms that contained complete foot and calf films were reviewed. On lateral films, the number of veins in the plantar venous plexus and its tibial outflow tract were counted. The length and diameter of the longest vein in the plantar venous system and the length of the foot arch were measured. The ratio of the length of the plantar venous plexus to the arch length was calculated. The presence or absence of valves within the plexus was recorded. Plantar venous plexus outflow was evaluated by an duplex ultrasonographic scan of the posterior tibial, anterior tibial, and peroneal veins during intermittent external pneumatic compression of the plantar surface of the foot.\nThe plantar venous plexus was composed of one to four large veins (mean, 2.7 veins) within the plantar aspect of the foot. The diameter of these veins was 4.0 +/- 1.2 mm. The veins coursed diagonally from a lateral position in the forefoot to a medial position at the level of the ankle, spanning 75% of the foot arch. Prominent valves were recognized within the plantar veins in 22 of 50 patients. The plexus coalesced into an outflow tract of one to four veins (mean, 2.5 veins) that flowed exclusively into the posterior tibial venous system. Small accessory veins that drained the plantar surface of the forefoot flowed into either the posterior tibial or peroneal veins. This pattern of selective drainage of the plantar venous plexus was confirmed by duplex imaging. Mechanical compression of the plantar venous plexus produced a mean peak velocity in the posterior tibial veins of 123 +/- 71 cm/sec, in the anterior tibial veins of 24 +/- 14 cm/sec, and in the peroneal veins of 29 +/- 26 cm/sec.\nThe plantar venous plexus is composed of multiple large-diameter veins that span the arch of the foot. Compression of the plantar venous plexus, such as that which occurs during ambulation, is capable of significantly increasing flow through the posterior tibial venous system into the popliteal vein. Its function may be integral to venous outflow from the calf and priming of the more proximal calf muscle pump.",

    "abstract": "Transvenous inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are used successfully for prevention of pulmonary embolism (PE), but early thrombotic complications such as insertion site thrombosis (IST) and inferior vena cava thrombosis (IVCT) may occur after placement. The frequency of these complications has been uncertain particularly for the wide variety of newer devices. This study was performed to prospectively evaluate IST and IVCT with color-flow venous duplex ultrasound scanning after four IVC filters were placed: the birds' nest filter, the titanium Greenfield filter, the stainless steel Greenfield filter, and the Simon nitinol filter.\nPercutaneous IVC filters were placed in 174 patients over a 21-month period. A birds' nest filter was used in 39 (22%) cases, a titanium Greenfield filter in 67 (39%) cases, a stainless steel Greenfield filter (25%) in 43 patients, and a Simon nitinol filter in 25 (14%) cases. Filters were placed for major deep venous thrombosis in 113 (63%) patients, after PE in 26 (15%) patients, and with prophylaxis in 35 (20%) patients. All patients had color-flow venous duplex ultrasound scanning of the insertion site and the inferior vena cava 7 to 10 days after placement or before discharge to document IST or VCT.\nEarly IST occurred in 43 (24.7%) cases, and early IVCT was observed in 20 (12%) cases in this series. No significant difference was found in the incidence of IST or IVCT among the four filter types used. The incidence of IVCT was significantly higher in patients having filters placed for PE. Men were more likely to receive a prophylactic filter than women in this study, but thrombotic complications were not related to patient sex. Thrombosis was seen with equal frequency at all insertion sites used. No patient died of PE after filter placement during the study period.\nThe incidence of thrombotic complications for all devices was higher than has generally been reported. No IVC filter used in this study demonstrated superior performance with regard to these thrombotic complications. As vena cava interruption devices are developed or significantly modified, prospective objective analysis of associated thrombotic complications will allow logical selection for clinical use.",

Pulsatile arterial flow and venous return was maintained with a roller pump and a centrifugal assist device. Flows and pressures were measured for three different fistula diameters (3, 4, and 5 mm). A canine model of venous hypertension with outflow obstruction was constructed in 15 adult mongrel dogs. After 7 to 13 days an externally supported 8-mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene femorocaval graft was implanted with a distal AVF (3 mm, n = 5; 4 mm, n = 5; 5 mm, n = 5). Arterial and venous flows and venous pressures were measured proximal and distal to the fistula before and after exercise.\nIn the in vitro system, flows through the venous graft increased with increasing fistula size, but venous return decreased progressively, increasing the distal venous pressure. In the canine model, flow in the venous graft increased with each AVF (p < 0.01). Only the 3-mm AVF resulted in decreased distal femoral vein pressure (p < 0.01), orthograde flow, and improved venous return with exercise.\nAVFs increased flow through the femorocaval grafts, yet they impeded venous return. The ideal AVF-to-graft ratio used in our study was 0.375, because it increased graft flow, permitted forward flow in the femoral vein while reducing pressure, and improved venous return with exercise.",

    "abstract": "This study compared 3 years of nonoperative therapy in a vascular clinic (1991 to 1993) with a proactive approach to diagnosis and operative treatment (1994 to 1995).\nIn the first period, 11 compliant men 48 to 69 years of age (average, 55 years) were treated without surgery using Unna's boot dressing, compression wound care, and patient education. In the second period, after duplex scans and venographic examinations when appropriate, operative interventions were performed in 10 patients.\nIn period 1 there were 44 occurrences of ulceration (range, 3 to 8 per individual), with an average time to heal of 13 weeks (range, 7 to 28 weeks per individual). Beginning in January 1994 (period 2), 11 patients who had current active ulceration underwent duplex scans and venographic examinations to detect correctable lesions, including deep, superficial, or perforator incompetence, or deep venous occlusions. Ten became candidates for surgery. One patient was not a candidate for venous surgery because of extensive caval thrombosis. Operations included extrafascial perforator division in nine patients; long saphenous stripping with submalleolar saphenous and perforator interruption in seven; one Palma crossover venous graft; and one superficial femoral valvuloplasty. In period 2 (24 months), there were two recurrent ulcers, one related to failure to use adequate compression and one related to infection of an incision. Nine of 10 patients remained healed at 24 months. Average time to heal was 4 weeks. Clinical severity score as described in the Consensus Statement of the American Venous Forum was reduced from 12 (range, 9 to 17) in period 1 to a mean of 3.5 (range, 2 to 8) in period 2 (p < 0.01 by paired t test).\nImproved diagnostic and operative techniques make possible more active approaches to venous ulceration. Nonoperative treatment, even in skilled hands, is associated with prolonged disability and ulcer recurrence. The condition of selected patients in whom nonoperative treatment fails can be improved substantially with operative intervention.",

    "abstract": "Compression of the lower extremity is the mainstay of therapy in patients who have chronic venous insufficiency. We evaluated the ability of two forms of compression-elastic stockings and an inelastic compression garment-with air plethysmography to determine how well they corrected abnormal deep venous hemodynamics in patients who had class III chronic venous insufficiency and how well this correction was sustained over time.\nPatients had measurements taken with no compression, with a 30 to 40 mm Hg below-knee stocking, and with the inelastic compression garment 2 hours and 6 hours after donning the garments. Therapies were compared with baseline and with themselves over time.\nInelastic compression maintained limb size and reduced venous volume better than no compression or stockings over time (ankle circumference at 2 hr vs 6 hr: baseline, 24.7 +/- 7 cm vs 26.1 +/- 1.1 cm; stocking, 23.9 +/- 1.1 cm vs 26.2 +/- 1.2 cm; inelastic compression, 25.4 +/- 1.1 cm vs 25.4 +/- 0.9 cm; venous volume at 2 hr vs 6 hr: baseline, 97.5 +/- 14.1 ml vs 105.2 +/- 17.9 ml; stocking, 112.4 +/- 29.7 ml vs 77.5 +/- 13.2 ml; inelastic compression, 72.2 +/- 14.1 ml vs 56.1 +/- 10.2 ml). At 6 hours, the ejection fraction was increased and the venous filling index was significantly less with inelastic compression compared with the stocking and baseline (ejection fraction at 6 hr: baseline, 61.6% +/- 6.9%; stocking, 75.9% +/- 17.7%; inelastic compression, 78.8% +/- 12.2%).\nInelastic compression has a significant effect on deep venous hemodynamics by decreasing venous reflux and improving calf muscle pump function when compared with compression stockings, which may exert their primary effect on the superficial venous system.",

Perfusion and when necessary ventilation scans were performed for diagnosis of pulmonary emboli (PE) in all patients immediately after admission and were repeated after approximately 10 days, whereupon oral anticoagulation was started unless contraindicated. Minimal and maximal anti-factor Xa activity was measured after 2 to 3 days of therapy. All patients were kept mobile with compression bandages. The primary end point was reduction in frequency of PE as assessed on the second lung scan.\nA total of 140 patients with confirmed DVT were randomized, 76 to group 1 and 64 to group 2. The two groups were comparable in their baseline clinical characteristics. In the initial lung scans 36 (47.4%) patients in group 1 and 29 (45.3%) patients in group 2 had objectively verified PE, but only 11 (14.5%) and 8 (12.5%) patients, respectively, had symptoms. After dalteparin treatment PE disappeared in two patients in group 1, but in two other cases new PEs occurred, (NS). In group 2 a resolution of PEs was observed in eight patients, whereas only one new PE could be detected. This change reflects the efficacy of therapy as defined by resolution of existing PEs and by the occurrence of new PEs and is statistically significant according to McNemar's chi-square test with the exact binomial method pair procedure (p < 0.05). Symptomatic PE was reduced from 14.5% to 5.3% in group 1 (96% to CI for the difference, -1.5% to +17.3%) and from 12.5% to 1.6% in group 2 (95% CI for the difference 0.7% to 18%, p < 0.05). There was one single fatal PE, one serious and three minor bleeding episodes in group 1, and one minor bleeding episode in group 2 (95% CI for the difference: -3.6% to +8.1%).\nTreatment of ambulant iliofemoral patients with DVT with 100 IU/kg dalteparin twice-daily appears to be moe safe and effective than 200 IU/kg given once-daily.

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to examine the role of superficial and deep venous reflux, as defined by duplex-derived valve closure times (VCTs), in the pathogenesis of chronic venous insufficiency.\nBetween January 1992 and November 1995, 320 patients and 500 legs were evaluated with clinical examinations and duplex scans for potential venous reflux. VCTs were obtained with the cuff deflation technique with the patient in the upright position. Imaging was performed at the saphenofemoral junction, the middle segment of the greater saphenous vein, the lesser saphenous vein, the superficial femoral vein, the profunda femoris vein, and the popliteal vein. Not all patients had all segments examined because tests early in the series did not examine the profunda femoris or lesser saphenous vein and because some patients had previous ligation and stripping or venous thrombosis. VCTs were examined for individual segment reflux, grouped into superficial and deep systems, and then correlated with the clinical stage as defined by the SVS/ISCVS original reporting standards in venous disease. Segment reflux was considered present if the VCT was greater than 0.5 seconds, and system reflux was considered present if the sum of the segments was greater than 1.5 seconds. Between-group differences were analyzed with analysis of variance and post hoc tests where appropriate.\nSixty-nine limbs studied were in class 0, 149 limbs were in class 1, 168 limbs were in class 2, and 114 limbs were in class 3. VCTs in the superficial veins were significantly lower in class 0 than in the other clinical classes. There was no difference in superficial reflux in the symptomatic limbs (classes 1 to 3). Reflux VCTs in the superficial femoral and popliteal veins increased as the clinical symptoms progressed, with a significant increase in class 3 ulcerated limbs when compared with nonuclerated limbs. The incidence of deep venous reflux was 60% in class 3 limbs, compared with 29% in class 2 limbs, whereas the incidence of superficial venous reflux did not differ among the symptomatic limbs. Isolated superficial femoral and popliteal vein reflux was uncommon, even in class 3 limbs, but combined superficial femoral and popliteal vein reflux was found in 53% of class 3 limbs, compared with 18.5% of class 2 limbs.\nReflux in the deep venous system plays a significant role in the progression of chronic venous insufficiency. Deep system reflux increases as clinical changes become more severe, with significant axial reflux contributing to ulcer formation.",

VCTs in the superficial veins were significantly lower in class 0 than in the other clinical classes. There was no difference in superficial reflux in the symptomatic limbs (classes 1 to 3). Reflux VCTs in the superficial femoral and popliteal veins increased as the clinical symptoms progressed, with a significant increase in class 3 ulcerated limbs when compared with nonuclerated limbs. The incidence of deep venous reflux was 60% in class 3 limbs, compared with 29% in class 2 limbs, whereas the incidence of superficial venous reflux did not differ among the symptomatic limbs. Isolated superficial femoral and popliteal vein reflux was uncommon, even in class 3 limbs, but combined superficial femoral and popliteal vein reflux was found in 53% of class 3 limbs, compared with 18.5% of class 2 limbs.",

    "abstract": "Air plethysmography has been useful in assessing patients who have chronic venous insufficiency. Limb reflux times determined by color-flow-assisted duplex scanning have been shown to correlate with the severity of chronic venous insufficiency. The purpose of this study was to compare air plethysmographic measurements with reflux times obtained by color-flow-assisted duplex scanning in patients with chronic venous insufficiency.\nOne hundred twenty-two limbs in 61 consecutive patients with various stages of chronic venous insufficiency were evaluated; air plethysmographic and color-flow-assisted duplex scans were performed at the same sitting. Fifty-nine of the patients had venous ulceration. Values obtained by air plethysmographic scans included venous filling index, ejection volume, residual volume, ejection fraction, and residual volume fraction. Color-flow-assisted duplex scan values included reflux times in the deep and superficial venous segments and total and mean limb reflux times.\nUsing the Pearson correlation, the venous filling index was found to correlate significantly with total limb venous reflux times, mean total limb reflux times, and venous reflux times in the deep venous system, as determined by color-flow-assisted duplex scans (p < 0.001).\nLimb reflux time as determined by color-flow-assisted duplex scans correlated significantly with the air plethysmographic variable accepted as a measure of the severity of venous reflux, the venous filling index. This study confirms the validity of total limb reflux times in the quantification of chronic venous insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "We have evaluated the progression of isolated superficial venous thrombosis to deep vein thrombosis in patients with no initial deep venous involvement.\nPatients with thrombosis isolated to the superficial veins with no evidence of deep venous involvement by duplex ultrasound examination were evaluated by follow-up duplex ultrasonography to determine the incidence of disease progression into the deep veins of the lower extremities. Initial and follow-up duplex scans evaluated the femoropopliteal and deep calf veins in their entirety; follow-up studies were done at an average of 6.3 days, ranging from 2 to 10 days.\nFrom January 1992 to January 1996, 263 patients were identified with isolated superficial venous thrombosis. Thirty (11%) patients had documented progression to deep venous involvement. The most common site of deep vein involvement was progression of disease from the greater saphenous vein in the thigh into the common femoral vein (21 patients, 70%), with 18 of these extensions noted to be nonocclusive and 12 having a free-floating component. Three patients had extended above-knee saphenous vein thrombi through thigh perforators to occlude the femoral vein in the thigh, three patients had extended below-knee saphenous disease into the popliteal vein, and three patients had extended below-knee thrombi into the tibioperoneal veins with calf perforators. At the time of the follow-up examination all 30 patients were being treated without anticoagulation.\nProximal saphenous vein thrombosis should be treated with anticoagulation or at least followed by serial duplex ultrasound evaluation so that definitive therapy may be initiated, if progression is noted. More distal superficial venous thrombosis should be carefully followed clinically and repeat duplex ultrasound scans performed, if progression is noted or patient symptoms worsen.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective study was performed to identify the patterns of calf vein thrombosis in patients in whom deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was suspected and to better define the role of color-flow duplex scanning (CDS) in the evaluation of this patient population.\nOver a recent 9-month period, we reviewed the vascular laboratory charts of 540 symptomatic patients (696 limbs) who underwent CDS for clinically suspected acute DVT. Patients who had a previous episode of DVT were excluded.\nCDS satisfactorily visualized all three paired calf veins in 655 of the limbs (94%). Inadequate scans (n = 41) were attributed to edema in 29, excessive calf size in eight, and anatomic inaccessibility in four. Peroneal veins were the most difficult to visualize (n = 29), followed by posterior tibial (n = 10) and anterior tibial (n = 9) veins. CDS identified acute DVT in 159 of 655 limbs (24%) that had adequate scans. Calf vein thrombi were detected in 110 of the 655 limbs (17%) and in 69% of the 159 limbs with DVT. Clots were confined to the calf veins in 53 limbs with DVT (33%). Isolated calf vein thrombi were found in 45% of outpatient limbs and in 27% of inpatient limbs with DVT. The peroneal (81%) and posterior tibial veins (69%) were more frequently involved (p < 0.001) than the anterior tibial veins (21%). In limbs with calf DVT, the prevalence of thrombosis isolated to the peroneal and posterior tibial veins was similar (37% and 25%, respectively); no limb had an isolated anterior tibial DVT (p = 0.02).\nCDS is a reliable method for evaluating calf veins for DVT. Calf vein thrombosis is common in patients who have acute DVT and often occurs as an isolated finding. The peroneal and posterior tibial veins are involved in the majority of cases; thrombi occur much less frequently in the anterior tibial veins. We conclude that CDS should be the noninvasive method of choice for the initial evaluation of patients in whom DVT is suspected, and we recommend that calf veins should always be studied but that routine scanning of the anterior tibial veins may not be necessary.",

Leukocyte emigration from the microcirculation and subsequent locomotion in response to venous hypertension was studied in a group of 12 normal volunteers using a \"skin window\" technique.\nTwo 0.5-cm square dermal abrasions were made with a dental stone over the gaiter area of the leg and the flexor aspect of the forearm (control), which were covered with moist micropore membranes. The volunteers lay supine for 30 minutes, and then stood supported for 30 minutes to raise the venous pressure in the leg, and then lay supine again for 30 minutes. The experiment was repeated in six volunteers who lay supine for the whole period. The membranes were changed and collected every 15 minutes, fixed in formal saline solution, and dual-stained for monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The type and numbers of cells that emigrated and the furthest distance traveled (leading front) by the cells through the membrane were measured.\nBoth in arms and legs, the vast majority of cells that emigrated were neutrophils, with very few monocytes (arm, 93% neutrophils and 7% monocytes; leg, 97% neutrophils and 3% monocytes). In the 30 minutes after venous hypertension, leukocyte migration significantly decreased in the leg (median leukocyte locomotion: basal, 75.3 microns; standing, 73.5 microns; after hypertension, 62.9 microns; p = 0.012, Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test), but not in the arm (basal, 86.2 microns; standing, 84.4 microns; after hypertension, 85.5 microns; p = NS) or when the experiment was repeated with the volunteers lying supine for the entire period (basal, 91.5 microns; standing, 89.4 microns; after hypertension, 92.6 microns; p = NS).\nLeukocyte migration is decreased immediately after experimental venous hypertension, which may be a result of the release of factors that inhibit migration.",

    "abstract": "The plasminogen system, which includes tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA), and their main inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), plays a major role in both fibrinolysis and tissue remodeling. This study compares the levels of tPA, uPA, and PAI-1 at the groin and ankle in normal and varicose greater saphenous vein (GSV).\nGSV was collected from patients undergoing varicose vein (VV) removal and from normal vein (NV) from arterial bypass procedures. Portions of the GSV at the groin and the ankle were minced and placed in serum-free media for 48 hours. Assays of the supernatants were obtained for tPA, uPA, and PAI-1 protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cyclohexamide and actinomycin D were also added to the media of the VV tissue explant supernatants to inhibit protein and RNA synthesis, respectively.\nLevels of tPA were significantly higher at the groin (11 +/- 2) than the ankle (5 +/- 1) in the VV (p < 0.005), and this trend was also seen in the NV (groin 10 +/- 2 and ankle 7 +/- 3). Levels of uPA were significantly higher in the groin VV (14 +/- 4.3) than in NV (3.0 +/- 0.8, p < 0.05). This difference, although not statistically significant, applied to the ankle as well (VV 14.5 +/- 6.3 and NV 5.3 +/- 2.7). No significant difference was seen between NV and VV for PAI-1 (NV, groin 155 +/- 73 and ankle 113 +/- 53, VV, groin 161 +/- 20 and ankle 142 +/- 38) or tPA. Inhibitor studies revealed no significant difference among control, cyclohexamide, and actinomycin D supernatants for tPA, suggesting release of protein rather than active synthesis. In contrast, inhibitor supernatants were significantly lower for uPA and PAI-1 than control supernatants (p < 0.05), suggesting that uPA and PAI-1 were actively synthesized.\nIn the tissue explant supernatant model uPA and PAI-1 are actively synthesized, but tPA is not. Levels of PAI-1 were comparable in all four groups. Levels of uPA in the varicose GSV were higher than in NV, suggesting a role for uPA in the pathologic makeup of VV. Levels of tPA were higher at the groin versus the ankle position, potentially explaining the previously described increased fibrinolytic activity seen at the groin.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine the degree of clinical and hemodynamic improvement after surgical ablation of incompetent superficial and perforator veins in limbs with combined deep and superficial venous incompetence manifested by chronic dermal ulceration.\nEleven limbs in 10 patients with class 5 or 6 venous insufficiency (ulceration) were assessed by CEAP (clinical, etiologic, anatomic, pathophysiologic) clinical scores, air plethysmography, color duplex ultrasonography, and phlebography (both ascending and descending). Surgical ablation of superficial and perforating veins was performed, followed by repeat clinical, air plethysmographic, and color duplex ultrasonographic examinations.\nAll 11 limbs had combined deep and superficial vein reflux on the preoperative color duplex ultrasound scan. Clinical symptom scores decreased from 10 to 1.4 after operation. Postoperative air plethysmography demonstrated significant reduction in reflux as measured by the mean venous filling index, which decreased from 12 +/- 5 ml/sec to 2.7 +/- 1 ml/sec after surgery. Calf pump function was also significantly improved, with a mean ejection fraction that increased from 43% +/- 11 to 59% +/- 13 and mean residual volume fraction that decreased from 56% +/- 15 to 33% +/- 16. Each of these measures was significantly different from the preoperative value (p < 0.05). Similar improvement characterized subgroups of limbs with three or more incompetent deep segments (n = 6) or popliteal segment incompetence (n = 6).\nSuperficial and perforating vein incompetence accounts for a substantial and correctable component of venous insufficiency in limbs with combined deep and superficial vein reflux and venous ulceration. These data indicate that surgical correction of this component significantly improves clinical symptoms and venous hemodynamics. Superficial and perforator ablation is an appropriate initial step in the management of combined deep and superficial venous incompetence.",

Both questionnaires included questions regarding attitudes about vascular surgical competence, operative experience, future vascular practice opportunities of general surgery residents, and the impact of a vascular surgery residency on general surgery resident education. In addition, the 1995 survey included questions regarding the duration, content, and prerequisite versus requisite experience for the vascular surgery residency.\nSignificant differences in opinions between SPDs and VPDs persisted regarding vascular surgery training of general surgery residents. SPDs were more likely to feel that general surgery graduates are fully competent in vascular surgery, should be exposed to more complex vascular surgery during training, and should be granted unlimited vascular surgical privileges on entering practice. Most VPDs felt that general surgery graduates lack competence in vascular surgery, should be exposed to less complex vascular surgery during training, and should have limited vascular surgery privileges in practice. Both groups of program directors agreed about the construct of vascular surgery residencies and that such residencies have had a favorable impact on general surgery resident education. Both SPDs and VPDs were willing to consider creative restructuring of vascular surgery residencies to accommodate governmental restrictions on funding of graduate medical education.\nExternal pressures forcing residency reform may provide an opportunity for SPDs and VPDs to creatively work with regulatory bodies to resolve differences in expectations of vascular surgery education and practice.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of arteriovenous fistulas combined with varying degrees of stenosis on distal bypass hemodynamics and Doppler spectral parameters.\nIn an in vitro flow model bypass stenoses causing 30%, 55%, and 70% diameter reduction were induced 10 cm upstream of a fistula with low outflow resistance. Flow and intraluminal pressure were measured proximal to the stenosis and downstream of the fistula. The waveform parameters peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, pulsatility index, and pulse rise time were determined from midstream Doppler spectra obtained 10 cm downstream of the fistula. All measurements were carried out with open and clamped fistula.\nAt 30% diameter reducing stenosis opening of the fistula induced a 12% systolic pressure drop across the stenosis but had no adverse effect on the Doppler waveform parameters. At 55% stenosis the pressure drop increased from 16% to 31% after fistula opening. This increased pressure drop was associated with a further reduction in peak systolic velocity, a decrease in pulsatility index, and an enhanced pulse rise time prolongation. Fistula opening at 70% stenosis increased the systolic pressure drop from 31% to 48% and had significant impact on all waveform parameters.\nDistal arteriovenous fistulas enhance pressure loss across stenoses and affect downstream velocity waveform configuration. The presence of a combined fistula and a stenosis mimics the distal hemodynamic conditions of a more severe stenosis. Assessment of the hemodynamic impact of fistulas must be undertaken in the evaluation of in situ vein bypass stenoses.",

    "abstract": "The study evaluated the deployment and healing of a novel self-expanding modular bifurcation endovascular prosthesis in a canine abdominal aortic aneurysm model. The endoluminal prosthesis consists of self-expanding nitinol stents lined by a synthetic prosthesis. One component of the device is a bifurcated body with a 12- to 14-mm diameter aortic segment and an integral 7- to 8-mm diameter iliac limb. The bifurcated body also has a stent-reinforced opening (pant-leg) for subsequent insertion of a contralateral 7- to 8-mm diameter iliac limb component.\nSeventeen bifurcated prosthesis were placed; 7 were inserted through the left common carotid artery and 10 from the femoral arteries. With either route of access the 16F or 17F aortoiliac limb and the 13F iliac limb delivery catheters enabled easy passage and secure positioning of the bifurcated prostheses. Predeployment and postdeployment inspection of the dimensions and continuity of the aortoiliac prosthetic components were evaluated by cinefluoroscopy and intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS).\nAfter deployment was done, interval patency was assessed with angiography, IVUS, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography with the prostheses removed for analysis at 1 week (n = 4), 1 month (n = 3), 3 months (n = 4), and 6 months (n = 6). Five of the first seven implanted prostheses had occlusion of segments of the device. In two dogs the bifurcated body and both legs were occluded. In the other three the nonoccluded leg and bifurcation body were fully patent. In the first seven animals IVUS at implantation showed compression of an iliac leg by the orifice of the contralateral iliac component. After concentric fixation of the flow divider was performed, only one additional iliac limb occlusion occurred in the next 10 animals. Cinefluoroscopy, computed tomography, IVUS imaging, and histologic analysis of retrieved specimens demonstrated healing of the aortoiliac prostheses without evidence of perigraft leaks.\nThis feasibility study demonstrates the ability to deploy and maintain acceptable patency of a self-expanding endoluminal, modular bifurcation prosthesis in a canine aortic model. Clinical evaluation of the device is planned for the near future.",

In the first seven animals IVUS at implantation showed compression of an iliac leg by the orifice of the contralateral iliac component. After concentric fixation of the flow divider was performed, only one additional iliac limb occlusion occurred in the next 10 animals. Cinefluoroscopy, computed tomography, IVUS imaging, and histologic analysis of retrieved specimens demonstrated healing of the aortoiliac prostheses without evidence of perigraft leaks.",

    "abstract": "This report reviews our recent experience with nine patients who had intramural hematoma of the thoracic aorta.\nThis was a retrospective study of all patients who had intramural hematoma at our institution from 1989 to 1994. Patients who had identifiable intimal flap, tear, or penetrating aortic ulcer were excluded from the study.\nAmong these nine elderly patients (mean age, 76 years), the most common presentation was chest or back pain. Intramural hematoma was diagnosed by a variety of high-resolution imaging techniques. The descending thoracic aorta alone was involved in seven patients, whereas the ascending aorta was affected in the other two patients. One patient had evidence of an aneurysm (5.0 cm diameter) in the region of the hematoma. All patients were initially managed nonsurgically with blood pressure control. Both patients who had ascending aortic involvement had progression of aortic hematoma, which resulted in death in one case and in successful surgery in the other. Six of the seven patients who had descending aortic involvement alone were successfully managed without aortic surgery. The patient who had intramural hematoma and associated aortic aneurysm, however, had severe, recurrent pain and underwent successful aortic replacement. Another patient had recurrent pain associated with hypertension, but was successfully managed nonsurgically with antihypertensive therapy. All eight survivors are doing well at a median follow-up of 19 months.\nIntramural hematoma appears to be a distinct entity, although overlap with aortic dissection or penetrating aortic ulcer exists. Aggressive control of blood pressure with intensive care unit monitoring has been our initial management. Patients who have involvement of the descending thoracic aorta alone can frequently be managed without surgery in the absence of coexisting aneurysmal dilatation or disease progression. Our experience suggests that a more aggressive approach with early surgery is warranted in patients who have ascending aortic involvement or those who have coexisting aneurysm and intramural hematoma.",

    "abstract": "Neurologic injury is one of the most devastating complications of combined carotid and cardiac procedures. Although the cause of the deficit is usually embolic, the exact cause is often not apparent at the time of surgery. We present a complex case of combined carotid endarterectomy, innominate artery reconstruction, and coronary artery bypass procedures in which intraoperative monitoring with somatosensory evoked potentials and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography combined with postoperative acetazolamide single photon emission computed tomographic scans was used to correlate intraoperative events with cerebral activity and functional results. Although computed tomographic scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical evaluation were negative for any evidence of stroke, the patient exhibited subtle postoperative changes in neuropsychologic function. These changes were correlated with intraoperative microemboli detected by transcranial Doppler monitoring, and postoperative acetazolamide single photon emission computed tomographic scanning, which revealed bilateral cortical defects.",

    "abstract": "Operative stroke complicating carotid endarterectomy is traditionally treated by reexploration of the operative site to correct a potentially causative lesion; however, attempts are not made to diagnose or treat the intracranial arterial occlusion. A 65-year-old man had a right hemiplegia during a left carotid endarterectomy that was caused by premature reversal of heparin, which resulted in thrombosis of his left anterior cerebral artery. On reexploration, the patient was treated with a 1-hour infusion of 1 million U urokinase through an indwelling carotid shunt. A repeat arteriogram demonstrated patency of the left anterior cerebral artery, with complete clot dissolution and resolution of the right hemiplegia on awakening. Natural history studies of stroke and prospective, angiographically controlled clinical trials of intraarterial thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke support the use of intraoperative intraarterial infusion of urokinase as part of a therapeutic approach to patients who have an ischemic stroke during carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "Although axillobifemoral bypass procedures have a lower mortality rate than aortobifemoral bypass procedures, they are limited by decreased patency, moderate hemodynamic improvement, and the need for general anesthesia. This report describes an alternative approach to bilateral aortoiliac occlusive disease using unilateral endovascular aortofemoral bypass procedures in combination with standard femorofemoral reconstructions.\nSeven patients who had bilateral critical ischemia and tissue necrosis in association with severe comorbid medical illnesses underwent implantation of unilateral aortofemoral endovascular grafts, which were inserted into predilated, recanalized iliac arteries. The proximal end of the endovascular graft was fixed to the distal aorta or common iliac artery with a Palmaz stent. The distal end of the graft was suture-anastomosed to the ipsilateral patent outflow vessel, and a femorofemoral bypass procedure was then performed.\nAll endovascular grafts were successfully inserted through five occluded and two diffusely stenotic iliac arteries under either local (1), epidural (5), or general anesthesia (1). The mean thigh pulse volume recording amplitudes increased from 9 +/- 3 mm to 30 +/- 7 mm and from 6 +/- 2 mm to 26 +/- 4 mm ipsilateral and contralateral to the aortofemoral graft insertion, respectively. In all cases the symptoms completely resolved. Procedural complications were limited to one local wound hematoma. No graft thromboses occurred during follow-up to 28 months (mean, 17 months).\nEndovascular iliac grafts in combination with standard femorofemoral bypass grafts may be an effective alternative to axillobifemoral bypass in high-risk patients who have diffuse aortoiliac occlusive disease, particularly when bilateral axillary-subclavian disease is present.",

    "abstract": "Exertional thrombosis of the axillary and subclavian veins, also known as Paget-Schr\u00f6tter syndrome, has been increasingly recognized in recent years as a cause of long-term morbidity. Recent aggressive approaches to treating Paget-Schr\u00f6tter syndrome have suggested the association of early failure with residual subclavian vein stenosis. As a result, the use of endoluminal stents has been proposed as an aid to venous percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for this disorder.\nThis report outlines the therapy of 11 consecutive patients with Paget-Schr\u00f6tter syndrome who were treated at our institution between October, 1992, and December, 1995. Stents were placed when percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was unsuccessful at achieving an adequate residual lumen.\nStents were placed after initial thrombolysis in six patients and in late follow-up in two patients. Of the six patients who had stents placed at initial thrombolysis, first-rib resection was eventually performed in four. In two patients first-rib resection was not performed, and stent fracture occurred in both. Late patency was achieved in the stents of six of the eight patients.\nTrials to evaluate stents as an adjunct to conventional therapy seem warranted. The use of stents alone without first-rib resection, however, appears to be associated with stent fracture.",

    "abstract": "Vascular surgeons are ideally suited to select and perform endovascular interventions either as primary therapy or as an adjunct to bypass surgery. Attaining proficiency in endovascular techniques is an important goal in the training of vascular surgeons. We report our initial experience with a program of endovascular intervention performed in the operating room by vascular surgeons.\nDuring the previous three years, we performed 109 angioplasty procedures, 60 aortoiliac (55%), 32 femoropopliteal (29%), and 17 popliteal/tibial (16%), using guidewires and angioplasty balloons directed by intraoperative digital subtraction C-arm arteriography with road-mapping capabilities. Indications for angioplasty included disabling claudication in 59 patients (54%), rest pain in 18 (17%), and tissue loss in 32 (29%). Angioplasty was accompanied by stent placement in 39 of 60 aortoiliac procedures (65%) and in two of 32 femoral procedures (6%). In 16 cases (15%), the endovascular procedure was performed in conjunction with a bypass procedure. In selected cases (15, 14%), duplex scanning was the sole diagnostic method used before surgery to identify the lesion, eliminating the need for preoperative arteriographic scans. Segmental pressure measurements, duplex ultrasound scans, and treadmill exercise testing as indicated were performed before and after surgery. The efficacy of the endovascular intervention was assessed at 3-month intervals during the first year and at 6-month intervals thereafter.\nA successful results was defined using criteria recommended by the Ad Hoc Subcommittee on Reporting Standards for Endovascular Procedures from the Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery. This included the combination of symptomatic improvement, obtaining an anatomically successful result with < 30% residual lumen stenosis, and elimination of the translesion gradient with an improvement in high thigh-brachial index or ankle-brachial index greater than 0.15. Initial success was achieved in 55 of 60 aortoiliac (92%), 28 of 32 femoropopliteal (88%), and 16 of 17 popliteal/tibial (94%) angioplasty procedures. Clinical follow-up has been achieved in all cases, with continued clinical success rates of 80%, 75%, and 82% for aortoiliac, femoropopliteal, and popliteal/tibial angioplasty procedures, respectively, with a mean follow-up of 15.7 months.\nThese results confirm the value of a program in which C-arm technology was used by vascular surgeons in the performance of angioplasty and stenting procedures in the operating room. This experience in therapeutic endovascular intervention will facilitate the credentialing process for future vascular surgeons.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to examine the effectiveness and the possible advantages of infrainguinal arterial reconstruction with nonreversed greater saphenous vein (NRGSV) grafts. We reviewed the results achieved with 189 consecutive NRGSV bypass procedures from July 1, 1985, to August 31, 1995, and compared them with 568 consecutive in situ greater saphenous vein (INGSV) bypass procedures completed over the same interval.\nNRGSV bypass procedures were performed by selecting the optimum inflow and outflow vessels and then excising the best available appropriate-length segment of greater saphenous vein. The valves were lysed with a Mills valvulotome using gentle antegrade distention with an isotonic electrolyte solution containing heparin (1000 U/500 ml) and papaverine (60 mg/500 ml). The graft was then translocated to the inflow site, where the proximal and distal anastomoses were sequentially completed, followed by a completion arteriography.\nDemographic and risk factor characteristics did not differ between patients who underwent NRGSV and those who underwent INGSV bypass. Compared with INGSV bypasses, NRGSV bypasses were more commonly secondary procedures (26% vs 8%; p < 0.001) and were more often performed for limb salvage indications (89% vs 68%; p < 0.001). NRGSV bypasses also had more distal inflow vessels (23% superficial femoral artery [SFA] and 28% popliteal artery [POP] vs 10% SFA and 1% POP; p < 0.001) and more distal outflow vessels (52% tibial and 22% pedal artery vs 47% tibial and 3% pedal artery; p < 0.001) than did INGSV bypasses. Despite the higher incidence of secondary bypass procedures and more distal outflow vessels in the NRGSV group, the overall results achieved at 5 years did not differ between the two groups. The 5-year primary patency rates were 65% +/- 5% for NRGSV and 72% +/- 3% for INGSV (p < 0.12), and the 5-year secondary patency rates were 74% +/- 5% and 82% +/- 2% (p < 0.08), respectively. Similarly, the 5-year limb salvage rate among bypass procedures performed for limb salvage indications did not differ for NRGSV (82% +/- 5%) and INGSV (90% +/- 2%; p < 0.06).\nThe application of the NRGSV bypass graft preserves the INGSV's main advantage of optimal size match between artery and vein at each anastomosis, but facilitaties the tailoring of the procedure to the patients anatomy and the completion of the bypass with the shortest, best-quality conduit available. Our application of the NRGSV in a more challenging series of bypass procedures produced equivalent results to those achieved in a concurrent series of INGSV bypass procedures.",

    "abstract": "The optimal anesthetic for use during carotid endarterectomy is controversial. Advocates of regional anesthesia suggest that it may reduce the incidence of perioperative complications in addition to decreasing operative time and hospital costs. To determine whether the anesthetic method correlated with the outcome of the operation, a retrospective review of 3975 carotid operations performed over a 32-year period was performed.\nThe records of all patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy at our institution from 1962 to 1994 were retrospectively reviewed. Operations performed with the patient under regional anesthesia were compared with those performed with the patient under general anesthesia with respect to preoperative risk factors and perioperative complications.\nRegional anesthesia was used in 3382 operations (85.1%). There were no significant differences in the age, gender ratio, or the rates of concomitant medical illness between the two patient populations. The frequency of perioperative stroke in the series was 2.2%; that of myocardial infarction, 1.7%; and that of perioperative death, 1.5%. There were no statistically significant differences in the frequency of perioperative stroke, myocardial infarction, or death on the basis of anesthetic technique. A trend toward higher frequencies of perioperative stroke (3.2% vs 2.0%) and perioperative death (2.0% vs 1.4%) in the general anesthesia group was noted. In examining operative indications, however, there was a significant increase in the percentage of patients receiving general anesthesia who had sustained preoperative strokes when compared with the regional anesthesia patients (36.1% vs 26.4%; p < 0.01). There was also a statistically significant higher frequency of contralateral total occlusion in the general anesthesia group (21.8% vs 15.4%; p = 0.001). The trend toward increased perioperative strokes in the general anesthesia group may be explicable either by the above differences in the patient populations or by actual differences based on anesthetic technique that favor regional anesthesia.\nIn a retrospective review of a large series of carotid operations, regional anesthesia was shown to be applicable to the vast majority of patients with good clinical outcome. Although the advantages over general anesthesia are perhaps small, the versatility and safety of the technique is sufficient reason for vascular surgeons to include it in their armamentarium of surgical skills. Considering that carotid endarterectomy is a procedure in which complication rates are exceedingly low, a rigidly controlled, prospective randomized trial may be required to accurately assess these differences.",

    "abstract": "The cause of coagulopathic hemorrhage during thoracoabdominal aneurysm (TAA) repair has not been well defined in human studies. We investigated changes in the coagulation system associated with supraceliac versus infrarenal cross-clamping to address this critical issue.\nBlood levels of fibrinogen, the prothrombin fragment F1.2, D-dimer, and factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII were analyzed in 19 patients with TAAs and four patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) at: (A) induction; (B) 30 minutes into supraceliac (TAA) or infrarenal (AAA) clamping; (C) 30 minutes after release of supraceliac or infrarenal clamps; and (D) immediately after surgery. Preoperative and intraoperative variables, including but not limited to aneurysm type, pathologic findings, comorbid conditions, clamp times, volume and timing of blood products, and clinical outcome, were prospectively recorded. Significance was determined by analysis of variance, Student's t test, and univariate linear regression.\nLevels of fibrinogen and factors II, V, VIII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII decreased (p < 0.05) at time B versus time A and returned to near baseline by time D. D-dimer and F1.2 increased starting at time B and reached significance (p < 0.05) by time D. Data points were compared for the TAA and AAA groups. Although AAA groups demonstrated a trend to factor activity reduction and increased fibrinolysis, the effect was much less pronounced than in TAA and did not approach significance. No correlation of coagulation change with clamping time was present; however, visceral clamping times were all less than 65 minutes (mean, 44 minutes). Blood and factor replacement was initiated after time B. Univariate regression analysis of factor level versus total blood replacement demonstrated a significant (p < 0.04) correlation between the reduction in the levels of factors II, V, VII, VIII, X, and XII, and the increase in the level of D-dimer at time B and subsequent total blood replacement.\nThoracoabdominal aneurysm repair is associated with a reduction in clotting factor activity and an increase in fibrinolytic function, which occurs after placement of the supraceliac clamp. Explanations include visceral ischemia or a greater and longer ischemic tissue burden as the likely cause of coagulation alterations. Total blood replacement during TAA procedures was correlated to the degree of factor reduction and fibrinolysis at the time of visceral cross-clamping. An aggressive approach to early blood component replacement and to coagulation monitoring could lessen blood loss during TAA repair and avoid potentially disastrous bleeding complications.",

D-dimer and F1.2 increased starting at time B and reached significance (p < 0.05) by time D. Data points were compared for the TAA and AAA groups. Although AAA groups demonstrated a trend to factor activity reduction and increased fibrinolysis, the effect was much less pronounced than in TAA and did not approach significance. No correlation of coagulation change with clamping time was present; however, visceral clamping times were all less than 65 minutes (mean, 44 minutes). Blood and factor replacement was initiated after time B. Univariate regression analysis of factor level versus total blood replacement demonstrated a significant (p < 0.04) correlation between the reduction in the levels of factors II, V, VII, VIII, X, and XII, and the increase in the level of D-dimer at time B and subsequent total blood replacement.",

    "abstract": "We have recently shown that nicotine and its metabolite cotinine are mitogenic for smooth muscle cells in vitro. In the present study, we examined the effect of nicotine and cotinine on the production of growth factors and the expression of matrix metallo-proteinases in smooth muscle cells.\nSmooth muscle cells were harvested from human arteries and grown in culture. Subconfluent cultures were incubated for 24 hours in M199 containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum with or without nicotine or cotinine at concentrations ranging from 10(-9) mol/L to 10(-6) mol/L. The supernatants and cell lysates were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), platelet-derived growth factor AB (PDGF-AB), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). Matrix metalloproteinase expression was determined in subconfluent cultures incubated in albumin with or without nicotine or cotinine at 10(-8) mol/L and 10(-7) mol/L for 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 hours. Northern blot analyses were performed with human cDNA probes for collagenase-1, stromelysin-1, gelatinase A, gelatinase B, and triose phosphate isomerase. Blots were quantified by phosphor-imaging techniques.\nBoth nicotine and cotinine stimulated the production and secretion of bFGF in a dose-dependent manner. PDGF, TNF-alpha, and TGF-beta secretions were not significantly affected by nicotine or cotinine. Collagenase was up-regulated by nicotine at 18 and 24 hours (4.5-fold to 5.8-fold) and by cotinine at 18 hours (from 5.0-fold to 29-fold). Stromelysin-1 was up-regulated by nicotine and cotinine at 12 and 18 hours (1.5-fold to 7.0-fold). Gelatinase A generally peaked at 12 hours and was up-regulated by both agents (2.0-fold to 6.5-fold).\nNicotine and cotinine enhanced the production of bFGF, a major mitogen for smooth muscle cells, and up-regulated the expression of several matrix metalloproteinases that are critical in cell migration. These data demonstrate mechanisms by which smoking may contribute to the development of intimal hyperplasia, atherosclerosis, and aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "The causes and management of prosthetic graft infections have been extensively studied for conventional bypass grafts; however, the infectivity and therapy for endovascular graft infections are completely unknown. The aim of this study was to compare the biologic properties of infected aortic grafts when inserted by endoluminal or standard transabdominal techniques.\nEighteen dogs underwent placement of polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in their infrarenal aortas either by an endovascular technique (8) or a standard interposition technique (10). Endovascular grafts were constructed from polytetrafluoroethylene (3 cm) and two balloon-expandable stents coaxially mounted onto a balloon catheter delivery system. The grafts were inserted through a left carotid arteriotomy under fluoroscopic control. Initially, seven grafts were infected with decreasing inocula of Staphylococcus aureus, starting at 10(7) organisms per ml for 30 minutes and then rinsed briefly (10 seconds) in normal saline solution, until a 50% infective dose for the standard grafts was determined to be 10(2) organisms per ml. After this initial experiment, a second group of 11 dogs were compared at a concentration of 10(2) S. aureus per ml. Five dogs underwent endovascular repair, and six dogs had standard graft interpositions after an identical period of bacterial exposure. All grafts were removed at 2 weeks under sterile conditions and were submitted for quantitative culture analysis.\nThree of the six dogs (50%) with standard grafts appeared to clear their infections, whereas only one of the five dogs (20%) with an endovascular graft was free of organisms at 14 days. This results was further manifested by statistically significant lower postmortem colony counts in the standard grafts (p < 0.01).\nThe endoluminal position of the graft and its proximity to the arterial wall do not appear to provide protection against infection. These data suggest that if endovascular grafts become infected, they may be in a disadvantaged position for host defense mechanisms to be effective.",

    "abstract": "Patients who have failing infrainguinal bypass grafts or failed grafts reopened with lytic therapy represent a group at high risk of subsequent failure. Previous studies suggest that vein patch angioplasty and jump grafting may be less durable than interposition grafting as a method of correcting graft lesions. Our objective was to assess the value of various technical strategies for graft revision in a series of autogenous infrainguinal bypass grafts and to assess how these variables might affect cumulative graft patency (CGP) rates.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the clinical course, anatomic sites of revision, and type of revision performed on 67 grafts in 58 patients who underwent at least one revision from 1991 to 1995. Results were assessed with regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier estimates of CGP rates (p < 0.05 was considered significant).\nSixty-seven vein grafts underwent revision of 112 anatomical sites in 95 operations. Forty-nine of 67 grafts were single-segment greater saphenous vein grafts and 18 were composite (> 1 segment) grafts, with an overall 5-year CGP rate of 72%. No difference was observed between the 4-year CGP rate in grafts with hemodynamically significant distal anastomotic stenoses repaired primarily with jump grafts (n = 20, 71% CGP rate) and those with stenoses found only in the graft body (n = 41, 89% CGP rate). Vein patch angioplasty was used primarily, but not exclusively, for focal graft body stenoses (n = 35), whereas interposition grafts (n = 11) were reserved for more diffuse strictures; no significant difference in 3-year CGP rates was observed (94% and 73%, respectively).\nUsing an appropriate revision strategy that favors vein patch angioplasty for graft body lesions and jump grafts for distal anastomotic lesions, acceptable assisted patency rates can be achieved in grafts that are at risk for repeated failure.",
