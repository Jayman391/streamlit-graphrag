    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify the determinants of long-term success with the peroneal artery bypass.\nSeventy-seven consecutive peroneal artery bypasses performed between 1981 and 1990 were reviewed to evaluate the influence of venous conduit modification, surgeon experience, patency of the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery at the ankle, and the quality of the peroneal collateral branches and pedal arch. The average follow-up was 34 months (range 1 to 92 months).\nThe 5-year primary and secondary patency rates were 61% and 92%, respectively. Modification of the vein graft at the initial procedure was necessary in 26 (34%). This led to a reduced (p < 0.001) 5-year primary patency rate of 22% compared with 80% for unmodified conduits. Operative results improved with surgeon experience. The 5-year secondary patency rate of grafts placed before 1985 was 82% compared with 98% for subsequent grafts (p < 0.03). The initial postoperative mean ankle/brachial index for grafts revised for hemodynamic failure or thrombosis in the follow-up period was 0.84 compared with 0.95 in grafts that did not require revision (p < 0.04). The presence of a patent dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery at the ankle and an intact pedal arch did not significantly influence primary or secondary patency. The 5-year secondary graft patency rate for patients with a patent dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery at the ankle was 88%.\nThe peroneal artery should be selected for outflow when it is the single tibial runoff vessel and is preferable to a bypass to an inframalleolar arterial segment. The quality of the venous conduit and the technical skill of the surgeon are the two most important factors in the success of bypasses to the peroneal artery.",

    "abstract": "To reduce the rates of morbidity and mortality in aortic graft infection, a new diagnostic approach is needed to help identify low-grade stages, specifically when there are minimal or no clinical signs of overt infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of technetium 99m--hexametazime white blood cell scanning (99mTc scanning) in detecting aortic graft infection, particularly in the low-grade stages.\nThirty-seven patients with suspected aortic graft infection were categorized into three groups according to their signs and symptoms on readmission. Ten patients (group A) had advanced graft infections that were correctly diagnosed by use of computed tomography (CT) scanning and 99mTc scanning and confirmed by intraoperative findings and culture results. Eighteen patients (group B) had nonspecific signs and symptoms of graft infection. Patients only underwent CT and 99mTc scanning for graft infection after standard clinical work-ups failed to reveal disease processes that accounted for the clinical symptoms. In this group of patients 99mTc scanning identified four cases of low-grade graft infection, which was confirmed by intraoperative findings and graft cultures. None of these four cases was confirmed by results of CT scanning. On an average 18-month follow-up in patients who did not undergo surgery graft infections developed. Nine patients (group C) had anastomotic aneurysms; CT scanning and 99mTc scanning correctly diagnosed five patients as being infected. The result of 99mTc scanning was false-positive in one patient.\nThe diagnostic accuracy of 99mTc scanning in patients who did not have specific signs of graft infection (groups B and C) was 100% for sensitivity, 94.4% for specificity, 90% for the positive predictive value, and 100% for the negative predictive value. 99mTc scanning seems to be a useful diagnostic technique for detecting aortic graft infection, particularly in low-grade stages.",

    "abstract": "Based on retrospective comparisons of duplex scanning with arteriography of the celiac (CA) and superior mesenteric (SMA) arteries in 34 patients, we previously suggested that an SMA peak systolic velocity of 275 cm/sec or greater or no flow signal and a CA PSV of 200 cm/sec or greater or no flow signal were reliable indicators of a 70% or greater angiographic stenosis of the SMA and CA, respectively. We now report the results of a blinded, prospective study in a larger patient group designed to determine the ability of mesenteric duplex scanning to visualize the CA and SMA and to validate our proposed duplex criteria for splanchnic artery stenosis.\nDuring an 18-month period 100 patients admitted to our vascular surgery service for aortography underwent routine mesenteric artery duplex scanning and lateral abdominal aortography regardless of abdominal symptoms. The lateral aortograms were evaluated to determine the presence or absence of a 70% or greater stenosis in the CA or SMA. Duplex-determined peak systolic velocities from the CA and SMA were recorded without knowledge of the angiographic results.\nAortography satisfactorily visualized 100% of the CAs and 99% of the SMAs. Of these, 93% of the SMAs and 83% of the CAs were visualized by duplex. According to the above criteria, duplex sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy for detection of a 70% or greater SMA stenosis were 92%, 96%, 80%, 99%, and 96% and for a 70% or greater CA stenosis 87%, 80%, 63%, 94%, and 82%.\nMesenteric duplex scanning is feasible in the majority of patients. Prospective evaluation of duplex diagnostic criteria for 70% or greater stenosis indicates that mesenteric duplex scanning is sufficiently accurate to be clinically useful as a screening examination to detect SMA and CA stenosis.",

    "abstract": "This study reviewed the outcome of 131 women who underwent infrainguinal bypass in 150 limbs from 1984 to 1991 for limb-threatening ischemia (95%) or disabling claudication (5%).\nThese women were compared with 209 men who underwent infrainguinal arterial reconstruction of 231 lower extremities for limb threat (89%) or claudication (11%) during the same interval. On average, women were 3 years older than men (mean age 72 vs 69 years, p < 0.005) but were less frequently cigarette smokers (56% women, 68% men, p < 0.05). Fifty-two percent of women had diabetes and 67% had hypertension, similar to the male patients. Infrainguinal disease distribution necessitated bypass to the above-knee popliteal artery in 10%, to the below-knee popliteal artery in 25%, and to the tibial or pedal arteries in 65% of women, comparable to the disease distribution in men. Autogenous vein grafts were performed in 90% of both groups.\nEarly postoperative (30-day) mortality was 4% for women and 2% for men (not significant). Life-table survival after 3 years, however, was only 54% in women, compared with 72% in men (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis indicated that diabetes increased the mortality rate 2.5-fold in women, which was not true in men. Three-year life-table survival of women with diabetes was only 39%, compared with 78% in women without diabetes (p < 0.001). Primary graft patency in women was 59% at 1 year and 54% at 3 years, significantly less than the 73% and 70% graft patency rates observed in men (p < 0.005). Secondary graft patency improved in women to 75% and 69% after 1 and 3 years, but this was still significantly less than the secondary patency rates of 89% and 86% observed in men (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that female sex decreased secondary graft patency 2.4-fold and was the only variable associated with graft failure. Cumulative 3-year limb salvage in women was 82%, not statistically different than the 89% limb salvage rate observed in men.\nWomen and men requiring arterial reconstruction for infrainguinal occlusive disease had comparable operative mortality and limb salvage rates, but long-term survival and graft patency were significantly reduced in women. Our results indicate that sex substantially influences the outcome of patients after infrainguinal bypass.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken (1) to determine whether correction of infrainguinal bypass stenoses detected with color duplex scanning (CDS) improved graft survival and (2) to define the natural history of grafts that did not undergo revision.\nOver a 39-month period 462 color-flow duplex scans were obtained on 170 limbs with autogenous vein grafts. Grafts were scanned within 3 months of operation, at 6 and 12 months, and then yearly. Doubling of the velocity at any point in the graft-arterial system compared with the velocity immediately above or below (velocity ratio > or = 2.0) was the criterion adopted for identification of a hemodynamically significant (> or = 50%) diameter reduction.\nOne hundred ten stenoses were detected in 62 (36%) of the limbs, of which 9 (8%) were in native vessels, 30 (27%) were at the anastomoses, and 71 (65%) were in the graft itself. Seventy-seven percent of the stenoses were detected in the first year. Twenty-four (39%) of the grafts with positive scans were revised. During follow-up, occlusions occurred in 10 (9%) of the 108 grafts with negative scans (NEG), in 2 (8%) of the 24 revised grafts with positive scans (PR), and in 10 (26%) of the 38 non-revised grafts with positive scans (PNR). Cumulative patency rates of NEG grafts were 90% at 1 year and 83% at 2 through 4 years. Similar patency rates were found in the PR vein grafts: 96% at 1 year and 88% at 2 through 4 years. In contrast, patency rates in PNR grafts with 50% or greater stenoses were only 66% at 1 year and 57% at 2 through 4 years. Log-rank tests showed a significant difference between the cumulative patency rates of NEG and PNR grafts (p < 0.002) and between PR and PNR grafts (p = 0.02). Flow velocities less than 45 cm/sec and ankle/brachial indexes did not discriminate well between grafts with or without 50% or greater stenoses or identify those grafts that subsequently occluded.\nThe results of this study suggest that CDS detects graft-threatening lesions, that a velocity ratio of 2.0 or greater is the most highly predictive parameter, and that revision of grafts with stenoses identified with CDS prolongs patency.",

Incidence of revision procedures and the primary and assisted primary patency rates were compared for 160 bypass grafts monitored during the first 2 years by use of color-flow duplex scanning of the vein graft and adjacent arterial segments (color-flow surveillance group) versus 41 bypass grafts monitored by use of clinical assessment alone (clinical follow-up group). Only grafts that were patent after the first postoperative month are considered.\nThe two groups were comparable with regard to most of the pertinent clinical factors. Stenotic lesions were identified in 58 bypass grafts, and severity was determined by use of intraarterial digital subtraction angiography. Eighteen bypass grafts with stenoses did not undergo a revision for reasons that were determined by the doctor, the hospital, or the patient. The occlusion rates of revised and nonrevised stenotic grafts were compared for lesions of different severity. None of the grafts for stenoses with 30% to 49% diameter reduction (DR) failed during follow-up. Occlusion occurred in 57% of the nonrevised and 9% of revised grafts (p = 0.047) for stenoses with 50% to 69% DR. Stenoses with 70% or greater DR were associated with graft failure in 100% of nonrevised bypasses and in 10% of revised grafts (p = 0.004). The assisted primary patency rate was higher in grafts that underwent color-flow surveillance compared with grafts with that underwent clinical follow-up (3-year patency rates of 91% and 72%, respectively; p = 0.004). The independent correlation of color-flow surveillance with higher patency rates was demonstrated in a proportional hazard analysis. The relative risk (probability of occlusion) in color-flow surveillance grafts is less than one third of the relative risk in bypass grafts that underwent clinical follow-up.\nWe conclude that revision procedures were more optimally used during color-flow surveillance, whereas asymptomatic stenotic graft lesions are missed with clinical follow-up, which results in a higher percentage of graft failures. Overall graft patency rates can be improved with use of color-flow duplex surveillance and repair of significant stenotic lesions.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous balloon angioplasty is an accepted technique for the treatment of short segmental stenoses of the iliac and superficial femoral arteries. Some surgeons have not embraced this technique because of lack of training, unfamiliarity with radiologic equipment, or poor-quality fluoroscopy equipment in the operating room. A new technique, ultrasound-directed balloon angioplasty, enables the vascular surgeon to guide the catheter and evaluate the progress of the procedure without the use of radiographic imaging.\nThe new catheter is integrated externally into a standard duplex scanner. A spherical brass bead positioned on the catheter shaft in the middle of the balloon is covered with a piezoelectric material. This omnidirectional receiver is connected through a wire to a catheter interface system, which allows the exact position of the balloon to be represented on the screen of a duplex unit. The catheter is advanced under visual control with use of the scanner.\nThe system has been used to perform balloon angioplasty on 21 lesions (16 superficial femoral, 3 iliac, 2 popliteal arteries) in 17 patients. Procedures in 16 patients were performed percutaneously; in an additional patient bilateral angioplasties were performed during operation. The balloon was successfully positioned in each case with use of ultrasonography alone; each procedure was confirmed by use of angiography. Angioplasty was accomplished in 16 (76%) of 21 with the ultrasound-guided catheter alone. Supplemental use of a high-pressure balloon or atherectomy device was necessary in five patients.\nThis technique records physiologic and anatomic data in real time so that the progress of the angioplasty can be monitored. In three patients the inadequacy of the initial angioplasty was recognized by a persistent velocity increase but not by angiography. As a result corrective measures were taken. This new procedure allows vascular surgeons to use equipment with which they are familiar, reduces the risk of ionizing radiation and contrast nephropathy, and permits the monitoring of the angioplasty with hemodynamic parameters.",

Two cases of aneurysm of the PSA are presented. Twenty-six aneurysms of the PSA, including our two cases, have been reported in the English literature in the last three decades. Early surgical treatment is warranted to decrease the 25% amputation rate associated with thromboembolic complications. The posterior, transgluteal repair of this aneurysm affords excellent exposure and avoids a long bypass graft, multiple incisions, and staged procedures.

This study evaluated the morphologic and physiologic characteristics of 72 lower extremity vein grafts functioning at 4.5 to 21.6 years (median 6.6 years).\nThe entire graft was imaged with use of color duplex ultrasonography and then classified as normal (class I), abnormal but not graft-threatening (class II), or abnormal and graft-threatening (class III) for the proximal, middle, and distal thirds. Thirty-one grafts (43%) were classified as normal, whereas 41 (57%) were classified as abnormal, with 58 class II and 15 class III segments.\nThree types of abnormalities were found by duplex imaging: nonstenotic wall plaques, discrete stenoses, and aneurysmal dilation. Aneurysms developed in five of seven grafts that had required thrombectomy in the distant past (mean of 40 months). There were 70 postoperative revisions in 38 limbs (53%). In 23 (60%) the conduit was revised, in 11 (29%) the revisions corrected progression of native artery atherosclerotic disease, and in 4 (11%) both types of revisions were required. Eleven grafts were revised in the first 30 days to correct technical errors. Eighteen limbs were revised between 1 and 24 months, with 12 (67%) of the revisions correcting stenotic lesions in the conduit or at one of the anastomoses. After 24 months 12 (67%) of 18 limbs were revised to correct progression of occlusive disease in the inflow or outflow vessels. At the time of this study 18 (67%) of the 27 conduits revised for intrinsic lesions were abnormal by color duplex imaging, and they harbored 12 (80%) of the 15-graft-threatening lesions.\nAutogenous vein remains the most durable arterial conduit, but vigilant surveillance is essential because the atherosclerotic environment continually produces lesions that may imperil the longevity of the graft.",

    "abstract": "The cause of vein graft failure in the intermediate postoperative period (3 to 18 months) has not been well defined. To delineate the incidence, characteristics, and anatomic distribution of lesions that cause graft failure in this critical interval, 227 consecutive infrainguinal reversed vein grafts (IRVGs) constructed at a single institution from July 1986 to December 1991 were prospectively entered into a duplex scan surveillance protocol.\nDuplex surveillance with arteriographic confirmation identified 29 patent, hemodynamically failing IRVGs during a mean follow-up of 22 months (range 1 to 64 months). An additional 18 grafts thrombosed before detection of any underlying abnormality; thrombolytic therapy and repeat operation uncovered the cause of occlusion in 12 of these grafts. The cause of graft failure (failing as well as failed) was therefore clear in 41 (87.2%) of 47 instances.\nThe causes of failure were intrinsic graft stenosis (n = 28; 59.6%), inflow failure (n = 6; 12.8%), outflow failure (n = 4; 8.5%), muscle entrapment (n = 2; 4.3%), and hypercoagulable state (n = 2; 4.3%). The most common intrinsic graft lesion was focal intimal hyperplasia (18 lesions in 16 grafts) in the juxtaanastomotic position, occurring solely in the vein graft itself. It occurred with equal frequency immediately distal to the proximal anastomosis or proximal to the distal anastomosis. Only rarely (n = 5) did this involve the juxtaanastomotic artery. Focal midgraft valvular stenoses (n = 6) and diffuse myointimal hyperplasia (n = 4) were also detected. The peak incidence of graft failure was 4 to 12 months after operation (70% within 12 months, 80% within 18 months).\nWe conclude that duplex surveillance of IRVGs is warranted by the 21% incidence of potentially remediable graft failure. A significant portion of these failures occur during the intermediate postoperative period (3 to 18 months), usually as a result of focal intrinsic vein graft lesions. With reversed vein conduits, these lesions arise predominantly in the vein graft itself, in the juxtaanastomotic position.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of angioplasty in the treatment of femoropopliteal arterial disease.\nFrom 1980 to 1991, 126 angioplasty procedures were performed in 131 limbs of 106 patients with 175 femoropopliteal lesions (26 common femoral, 118 superficial femoral, and 31 popliteal). Critical ischemia was present in 55 limbs (42%), and claudication was present in 76 (58%). Angioplasty was performed for a single lesion in 87 limbs (66%) and for multiple lesions in 44 (34%). In 13 limbs (10%) the most severe lesion was an occlusion; in 118 (90%) all lesions were stenoses. Distal runoff was good (2 or 3 vessels patent) in 72 limbs (55%) and poor (0 or 1 vessel patent) in 59 (45%).\nDeath within 30 days occurred in 0.8%, nonfatal systemic morbidity in 7.1%, and local morbidity in 1.6% of procedures.

    "abstract": "Between 1977 and 1991, 405 patients with atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the superficial femoral artery underwent clinical as well as noninvasive laboratory evaluation and were recommended for nonoperative treatment.\nLimbs with uncorrected aortoiliac occlusive disease, aneurysmal degeneration, or previous femoropopliteal bypass were excluded, leaving 568 involved extremities. Complete follow-up, which forms the basis for this report, was available in 377 patients (93%) with 520 limbs (93%). Patients were monitored for a minimum period of 2 years (range, 24 to 164 months; median, 86 months). During the surveillance period 45 limbs (8.6%) in 42 patients (11.1%) required arterial intervention. This entailed operation in 39 cases and endovascular treatment in six cases. With use of life-table analysis, the risk for intervention was found to be 11% at 5 years and 14% at 10 years. A total of 14 limbs (2.7%) in 14 patients (3.7%) ultimately required major limb amputation, either after failed bypass (8 patients) or as a primary procedure (6 patients).\nAnalysis of risk factors revealed that female sex (p = 0.04), chronic renal failure (p = 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.0011), history of contralateral femoropopliteal bypass (p = 0.0005), level of disease (p = 0.003), and entry ankle/brachial index less than 0.50 (p = 0.004) were associated with an increased risk over time for intervention. Other factors, including age, current or prior smoking history, hypertension, and the presence of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular disease failed to reach statistical significance.\nThese data support the continued conservative approach to surgery for patients with superficial femoral artery occlusive disease without limb-threatening symptoms. Patients with multilevel disease, lower ankle/brachial index, a history of contralateral femoropopliteal bypass, chronic kidney failure, or diabetes mellitus are at increased risk and should be monitored more closely.",

Annual stroke, TIA, and combined event rates were 2.7%, 3.6%, and 6.2%, respectively. Although patients with 80% to 99% lesions had a 20.6% annual event rate, most events occurred contralateral to these lesions; the vessel-specific annual event rate for 80% to 99% disease was 5.1%. Only one of 15 strokes occurred ipsilateral to an 80% to 99% stenosis. Echolucent plaques were associated with TIA and stroke (5.7% annual vessel event rate vs 2.4% for echogenic plaques, p = 0.03). Disease progression was highly correlated with TIA and stroke (p < 0.0001), but it usually occurred in association with rather than before ischemic events, thus proving more useful in explaining pathogenesis than in predicting future events. There was no association between aspirin use and TIA, but patients taking aspirin had a threefold higher annual stroke rate (1.6% vs 4.8%, p = 0.027).\nThis study, while confirming significant risk for asymptomatic patients with critical stenosis or echolucent plaque, demonstrates the importance of contralateral disease and the absence of orderly progression from minimal disease through high-grade stenosis to symptomatic cerebral ischemia. TIA and stroke commonly occur in association with abrupt, unpredictable, quantum changes in carotid artery disease.",

    "abstract": "The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) has thus far demonstrated conclusive benefit for carotid endarterectomy for patients with symptomatic 70% to 99% internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. In the NASCET, ICA stenosis was classified angiographically: % ICA stenosis = (1 - [narrowest ICA diameter/diameter normal distal cervical ICA]) x 100%. However, widely used duplex scan criteria for ICA stenosis correlate with different angiographic categories of high-grade stenosis (50% to 79%, > 80%) and were developed on the basis of estimated bulb diameter. We therefore blindly evaluated with separate observers carotid angiograms from 100 patients who also underwent carotid duplex scanning in our vascular laboratory.\n\"Angiographic stenosis\" was calculated as in NASCET. Duplex scan measurements of ICA peak systolic velocity (PSV), ICA end-diastolic velocity, and the ratio of ICA PSV to common carotid artery (CCA) PSV were analyzed for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy to identify a 70% to 99% ICA stenosis.\nAnalysis of the data revealed that an ICA PSV/CCA PSV ratio of 4.0 provided the best combination of sensitivity (91%), specificity (87%), positive predictive value (76%), negative predictive value (96%), and overall accuracy (88%) for detection of a 70% to 99% stenosis.\nWe conclude duplex scan determination of 70% to 99% stenosis as defined in the NASCET requires the adoption of duplex criteria modified from those in current use in most vascular laboratories.",

    "abstract": "The aorta is the conventional inflow source for reconstructions in patients with aortoiliofemoral occlusive disease. In patients with unilateral iliac or femoral disease, femoral-to-femoral bypasses have been used but with less favorable patency rates. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the unobstructed iliac artery as an inflow source for ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral reconstructions in iliofemoral occlusive disease.\nOver the past 6 years 322 reconstructions have been performed with the iliac artery as the donor vessel. Patients were evaluated for proximal hemodynamically significant lesions by augmented pullout pressures during aortography. Patients who had balloon angioplasty were excluded.\nResults were compared with 192 patients who underwent conventional aortodistal bypass operation for occlusive disease during the same period. Both groups were similar in risk factors, age, sex, and indications for operation. For the iliac group the operative mortality rate was 1.6%, and the 30-day patency rate was 97%, similar to those in the aortic group (3.6% and 95%, respectively). Cumulative patency rates at 5 years by life-table analysis were 82% for iliac artery inflow and 77% for aortic inflow reconstructions.\nOur experience suggests that an unobstructed iliac artery is a reasonable inflow source for reconstructions in iliofemoral occlusive disease. The long-term patency rate is comparable to aortodistal bypasses and superior to other extraanatomic bypasses.",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction techniques tailored to operative findings were applied to 466 consecutive carotid endarterectomies (CEA) performed on 408 patients over 5 years. The choice of reconstructive technique was based on the extent of the arteriotomy incision required to obtain a complete internal CEA endpoint, the ability to obtain a complete endpoint, and the quality or redundancy of the endarterectomized internal carotid artery (ICA) segment. The hypothesis was that a complete internal CEA endpoint and a tapered, smooth, nonkinked reconstruction minimize complications.\nComplete distal endpoint feathering was obtained in 437 (94%) CEA. Patch reconstruction was performed in the 429 (92%) CEA in which the arteriotomy extended distal to the ICA bulb. Before patching, 16 (3.4%) redundant endarterectomized ICA segments were shortened by transverse-eversion suture plication to prevent kinking. A saphenous vein interposition graft was used in nine (1.9%) CEA. The other 28 (6.0%) CEA had an arteriotomy that did not extend distal to the bulb and were primarily closed.\nTwo (0.4%) patients died of myocardial infarction in the hospital; one of these patients also had a stroke. Three (0.6%) patients had nonfatal strokes in the hospital. Five patients had hyperperfusion syndrome after CEA, one of which occurred without complications in the hospital. The other four occurred after discharge from the hospital. Three of these patients had a stroke, and two with strokes died. The combined 30-day mortality and nonfatal stroke rate was 2.1% for CEA and 2.4% for patients. There were no patch ruptures, false aneurysms, or ICA occlusions. Three patients had a > 50% diameter carotid artery stenosis 6 months after CEA.\nThese results support an aggressive attempt to obtain a complete or optimal ICA endpoint with reconstruction techniques based on operative findings. Recognition of patients at risk for and treatment of hyperperfusion syndrome after CEA remains a clinical challenge.",

    "abstract": "Injury to the innominate artery may represent a zone I cervical, thoracic outlet, or intrathoracic vascular injury and poses diagnostic, exposure, and management problems for the general, vascular, and thoracic surgeon. This complex injury often becomes a new learning experience with each infrequent encounter.\nBetween 1960 and 1992 43 patients with innominate artery injuries were treated. Penetrating injuries were from gunshot wounds in 25, stab wounds in 7, and shotgun wounds in 2 patients. Blunt injuries accounted for seven of the patients. In 28 patients there were multiple injuries, including multiple vascular injuries. Median sternotomy was used in all planned operations in the later part of the study, and bilateral transsternal anterolateral thoracotomy was used in patients undergoing urgent or emergency center thoracotomy.\nBlunt injury resulted in tears near the aortic arch with intimal disruption. Bypass grafting without hypothermia, shunts, or systemic heparinization is now used in all patients. Thirty-two patients survived to leave the hospital with no new complications related to the procedure. Postoperative neurologic complications were associated with preexisting neurologic deficits.\nPatients with innominate artery injury and stable vital signs can usually be transported without difficulty and treated without complex perioperative adjuncts. These patients can undergo revascularization with simple vascular surgical techniques and should expect an uncomplicated postoperative course unless there has been associated central nervous system injury or related injuries leading to systemic infection. Synthetic conduits have been used with success and have not required systemic heparinization or complex temporary shunting.",

    "abstract": "Although spontaneous thrombosis of femoral false aneurysms (FAs) and arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) has been reported, the frequency of this occurrence is unknown. This prospective study was designed to establish the natural history of FA and AVF and to evaluate factors that might predict eventual thrombosis of these lesions.\nTwenty-two patients with either femoral FAs (n = 16) or AVFs (n = 6) induced by percutaneous arterial punctures were evaluated prospectively. After an initial duplex scan, all patients were monitored with serial scans, either in hospital or weekly as outpatients, depending on the stability of the process. Operative repair was performed for the following indications: (1) a greater than 100% increase in size of a FA by duplex scan, (2) the development of symptoms, or (3) continued patency of the lesion after 2 months of observation.\nNine of 16 FAs and four of six AVFs closed spontaneously; FAs greater than 6 cm3 (1.8 cm in diameter) required repair more often (p = 0.065). However, size was not an absolute predictor of the need for repair because two small aneurysms (1.6 and 0.7 cm3) remained patent, although both patients were discharged safely from the hospital, and two large aneurysms (13.2 and 10.7 cm3) thrombosed spontaneously. Three of seven patients whose aneurysms required repair received anticoagulation continuously from the time of catheterization until repair became necessary. None of the patients whose FAs closed spontaneously were receiving anticoagulants at the time of thrombosis (p = 0.02). Neither length of the FA neck, velocity in the FA cavity, size of original arterial puncture, nor velocity in the AVF correlated with thrombosis.\nWe conclude that (1) all FAs do not thrombose spontaneously and at least one third require surgical repair, (2) patients receiving continuous anticoagulation should undergo aneurysm repair, (3) discharge of patients with FAs less than 6 cm3 is safe (the majority of these FAs will eventually thrombose spontaneously), and (4) many AVFs close spontaneously and repair is not required unless symptoms or signs of progressive enlargement develop.",

    "abstract": "Five hundred fourteen consecutive patients with an isolated upper or lower extremity penetrating injury were entered into a prospective study designed to refine the indications for diagnostic arteriography.\nTwenty-two (4%) patients with limb-threatening ischemia who required immediate operation and 23 (4%) who refused arteriography were excluded from subsequent analyses. The remaining 469 patients were classified as being at high, intermediate, or low risk for an arterial injury.\nTwo hundred thirteen patients who were at low risk were observed for 24 hours, discharged, and monitored as outpatients. No delayed complications of an arterial injury developed in any patient in this group. The intermediate-risk group of 151 patients and the high-risk group of 105 patients underwent arteriography. Seventy-seven injuries were identified; 24 were major (limb-threatening) and 53 were minor. Fourteen major injuries required operative repair or transcatheter embolization; the remaining 10 nonocclusive major injuries were observed without sequelae.\nBy step-down logistic regression only pulse deficit (p < 0.01) and an ankle/brachial or wrist/brachial index less than 1.00 in the injured extremity (p < 0.03) were found to be significant predictors of an arterial injury. The presence of either of these two clinical variables successfully predicted all major arterial injuries. This prospective study supports the proposition that arteriography that is limited only to those patients who have either a pulse deficit or minimum ankle/brachial or wrist/brachial index less than 1.00 successfully detects all significant arterial injuries.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to review our experience with externally supported, knitted Dacron grafts used for axillofemoral bypass.\nRetrospective analysis was performed on records of 79 consecutive axillofemoral bypass graft operations performed on 77 patients from January 1978 to April 1990.\nThe mortality rate within 30 days of operation was 5% (four of 79); 36 patients died in the follow-up period; none died of graft causes. During this 12-year period (mean follow-up 42 months) three patients were unavailable for follow-up. The primary patency rate was 78% at 5 years and 73% at 7 years, with no change thereafter. Neither the graft configuration (i.e., axillounifemoral [n = 50] vs axillobifemoral [n = 29]) nor patency of the superficial femoral artery had an impact on the primary patency rate. Patients who underwent surgery for disabling claudication (n = 30 grafts) had a primary patency rate of 80% at 6 years compared with 65% at 6 years for those who required surgery for limb salvage (n = 49 grafts); the difference was not significant (p = 0.37). Actuarial survival of patients with axillofemoral grafts was 23% at 10 years compared with 72% in a concurrent population of patients with aortofemoral bypass (p < 0.001).\nThese findings indicate that axillofemoral bypass grafts may be appropriate for high-risk patients with severe aortoiliac disease who require revascularization for either limb salvage or incapacitating claudication.",

    "abstract": "Clinical observations suggest that some aneurysms may be manifestations of intrinsic tissue abnormalities or systemic disease. Several investigators have reported reduced elastin content and increased elastase activity in infrarenal aortic aneurysms. Alpha 1-antitrypsin is the primary serum protease inhibitor modulating elastase activity. Elevated elastase activity caused by reduced alpha 1-antitrypsin inhibition, theoretically, could contribute to aneurysm formation. We report a case of ruptured middle colic artery aneurysm in a patient with multiple visceral artery aneurysms and profound alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Reported middle colic artery aneurysms are reviewed, and etiologic implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Two hundred thirty-six limbs of 220 unselected patients who were admitted with venous problems (83 with ulcers) were studied with continuous-wave Doppler ultrasonography, duplex scanning, and ambulatory venous pressure measurements. Patients with evidence of deep venous disease because of reflux or obstruction in the deep veins on Doppler and duplex ultrasonic examination or with an ambulatory venous pressure greater than 45 mm Hg despite the ankle cuff had venography. One hundred fifty-three limbs had superficial venous disease (reflux in the superficial veins with competent popliteal valves), and 83 limbs had deep venous disease (popliteal reflux on duplex examination or deep venous obstruction on venography). No ulceration occurred in limbs with ambulatory venous pressure < 30 mm Hg, and there was a 100% incidence with ambulatory venous pressure > 90 mm Hg. A linear increase occurred from 14% in limbs with ambulatory venous pressure between 31 and 40 mm Hg to 100% in limbs with ambulatory venous pressure greater than 90 mm Hg (r = 0.79). In the groups studied, an increased incidence of ulceration was associated with an increase in ambulatory venous pressure irrespective of whether the venous problem was the result of superficial or deep venous disease. Ambulatory venous pressure has both diagnostic and prognostic significance in patients with venous disease.",

Previous balloon embolectomy and heparin therapy had failed. The flow rate was able to be increased progressively without rise in the line pressure during the course of the perfusion, indicating an increase in capacity of the peripheral arterial bed. Fibrinogen and plasminogen levels in the isolated circulation remained low throughout the perfusion. The concentration of cross-linked fibrin degradation particles (d. dimer) rose progressively in the isolated circulation but remained at normal levels in the systemic circulation during perfusion.\nCompletion angiography demonstrated clearance of thrombus in the popliteal artery and appearance of arteries not seen on preperfusion films. Clinical improvement paralleled the angiographic appearances, with restoration of limb viability.\nWe concluded that isolated limb perfusion with use of urokinase is safe and worthy of further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The natural history of untreated major injuries is not well known, although serious complications are seen. The follow-up of patients who have trauma is often incomplete, and this study was undertaken to evaluate the nature of these wounds.\nThirty-one patients with missed major arterial wounds were examined and treated according to the pathologic condition encountered. All had been seen at other hospitals, some on more than one occasion, and then sought assistance for continued problems.\nThere were 16 aneurysms in 31 patients: 4 arteriovenous fistulas, 4 dissections, 3 thromboemboli, and 1 stenosis. The arteries included the following: carotid 12, aorta 5, femoropopliteal 8, subclavian 2, axillary 1, innominate 1, iliac 1, and tibial 1. Three patients had a stroke, one had a transient ischemic attack, two had leg ischemia, and one had a gangrenous foot. Operation was required in 27 patients; there were no deaths.\nTransmural traumatic arterial wounds of major vessels can result in serious delayed complications, months or even years after the injury. False aneurysms, dissections, occlusions, and fistulas in the extremities may not be lethal, but they cause significant disability. Such lesions in the neck or trunk are more dangerous. Despite the inconvenience and expense, patients with injuries of major arteries are best served by early repair of the wound.",

    "abstract": "Adventitial elastin degradation is a hallmark of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation in human beings, although the quantitative relationship between elastin loss and AAA formation and growth is unknown. This study was undertaken to quantitate the reduction of adventitial elastin for small AAA, to determine whether the loss of this structural component parallels aneurysm growth, and to examine the ultrastructure of the remaining elastin elements.\nLongitudinal strips of anterior aneurysm wall were taken from 12 patients having elective repair of small (diameter < 5 cm, n = 4), moderate (diameter < 5 to 7 cm, n = 4), or large (diameter > 7 cm, n = 4) AAA and from six normal control subjects at autopsy. Specimens were prepared with elastin and collagen stains for histologic examination or formic acid for scanning electron microscopic evaluation of elastin architecture. Adventitial elastin content of aneurysmal and control aortas was quantitated with video microscopy and compared by aneurysm diameter.\nThe inner portion of adventitia of normal aortic wall was composed of densely compacted alternating lamellae of elastin and collagen, which were grossly disrupted in all aneurysms. The remaining elastin fibers were disorganized and tortuous. There was an 81.6% +/- 2.1% reduction in elastin lamellae and an 85.7% +/- 4.2% reduction in fibers per lamellae compared with the number in control aortas (p < 0.001). Size of the aneurysm made no difference in adventitial elastin content.\nThese data strongly suggest that elastolysis is a primary event in AAA formation that occurs before over loss of adventitial structural integrity and the development of small aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to retrospectively identify variables associated with early death and postoperative complications in patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic operations.\nThe data on 1509 patients who underwent 1679 thoracoabdominal aortic repairs between 1960 and 1991 were retrospectively reviewed. The median age was 66 years (range 1.5 years to 86 years), and aortic dissection was present in 276 (18%) patients. The extent of the first repair performed included 378 (25%) type I (proximal descending to upper abdominal aorta), 442 (29%) type II (proximal descending aorta to below the renal arteries), 343 (23%) type III (distal descending and abdominal aorta), and 346 (23%) type IV (most of the abdominal aorta). The median total aortic clamp time was 43 minutes.\nThe 30-day survival rate was 92% (1386/1509) for the 30-year period. On multivariate analysis the preoperative and operative variables associated with death included (p < 0.05) increasing age, preoperative creatinine level, concurrent proximal aortic aneurysms, coronary artery disease, chronic lung disease, and total aortic clamp time. When the postoperative variables were also included in the stepwise logistic regression model, then in addition, cardiac complications, stroke, kidney failure, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage became significant (p < 0.05). The overall incidence of paraplegia or paraparesis was 16% (234/1509). By use of stepwise logistic regression analysis, the significant predictors (p < 0.05) of paraplegia or paraparesis developing were total aortic clamp time, extent of aorta repaired, aortic rupture, patient age, proximal aortic aneurysm, and history of renal dysfunction. Kidney failure (postoperative creatinine level > 3 mg/dl or dialysis) occurred in 18% (269/1509) of patients; dialysis was required in 9% (136/1509). Gastrointestinal complications manifested in 7% (101/1509) of patients.\nAlthough the survival rate has improved, paraplegia/paraparesis and kidney failure continue to be vexing problems that require further research.",

When the postoperative variables were also included in the stepwise logistic regression model, then in addition, cardiac complications, stroke, kidney failure, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage became significant (p < 0.05). The overall incidence of paraplegia or paraparesis was 16% (234/1509). By use of stepwise logistic regression analysis, the significant predictors (p < 0.05) of paraplegia or paraparesis developing were total aortic clamp time, extent of aorta repaired, aortic rupture, patient age, proximal aortic aneurysm, and history of renal dysfunction. Kidney failure (postoperative creatinine level > 3 mg/dl or dialysis) occurred in 18% (269/1509) of patients; dialysis was required in 9% (136/1509).

    "abstract": "Dissatisfaction with conventional methods of treatment of infected infrarenal aortic prosthetic grafts and excellent long-term results reported by heart surgeons after allograft replacement for management of infections involving the ascending aorta have prompted us to investigate allograft replacement in the management of arterial infections.\nFrom October 1988 to April 1992, 43 consecutive patients with infected infrarenal aortic prosthetic grafts underwent in situ replacement with preserved allografts obtained from cadavers as part of a program to retrieve multiorgan transplant tissue. Thirty-four patients had isolated prosthetic infections, whereas nine had aortoenteric fistulas. One patient had a concomitant below-knee amputation for septic arthritis of the ankle as a result of septic emboli. Nineteen patients had nonvascular-associated procedures, including 17 intestinal procedures.\nFive patients (12%) died after operation: four of general causes and one of rupture of the native aorta as a result of persistent infection. Three patients successfully underwent repeat operation for allograft-related complications (one case each of occlusion, septic rupture, and graft-enteric fistula). All surviving patients were discharged after control angiography showed patent allografts. Two patients were unavailable for follow-up. The other 36 patients have been monitored with serial duplex and computed tomography scanning for a mean follow-up of 13.8 months (range 1 to 42 months). There were four late deaths: three were unrelated to the vascular operation, and one may have been caused by late persistent or recurrent infection. Nine patients (26%) have had pathologic changes in the allograft, with three (9%) requiring repeat operation. There were no early or late postoperative amputations in the entire series.\nAlthough complete protection against persistent or recurrent infection has not been achieved and late deterioration may be expected, in situ allograft replacement seems to be a major advance in the management of infected infrarenal aortic prosthetic grafts.",

    "abstract": "Arterial bypass from the descending thoracic aorta to the femoral system provides successful perfusion when an approach to the abdominal aorta is undesirable. This review of a large series with a decade of experience was conducted to better define patency data and the natural history of patients after this operation.\nDuring a 10-year period, 21 patients, 18 men and 3 women (mean age 57 years), underwent descending thoracic aorta to left femoral artery bypass with femorofemoral bypass. These were placed to convert axillopopliteal or axillofemoral grafts (12 patients) to a more permanent inflow source. The axillary bypasses had been previously placed to allow removal of infected aortic grafts and had undergone a total of 14 revisions or thrombectomies before conversion. In addition, patients had this procedure after multiple failed attempts (at least two) at intraabdominal aortic repair (five patients) or to avoid exploration of the abdomen after extensive retroperitoneal dissection or radiation (four patients). Surgical technique involved a seventh interspace thoracotomy with a transdiaphragmatic retroperitoneal anterior axillary line tunnel to the left groin.\nThere was no perioperative mortality. The mean hospital visit was 15.1 days and intensive care stay 4.3 days. There was no perioperative myocardial infarction, stroke, or renal failure that necessitated dialysis. With a follow-up period of 1 to 121 months (mean 44), the 4-year patency rate was 100%. A single graft failed at 49 months but was renewed by thrombectomy and femorofemoral bypass. Thus the extended patency rate was 86%, but the secondary patency rate remained 100% throughout. Since the thoracic operations, patients have required five femoropopliteal, three femorotibial, two profunda, and two femorofemoral operations.\nDescending thoracic aorta-to-femoral artery grafting is a safe, extremely durable arterial bypass configuration. It is an excellent reconstruction for survivors of aortic graft infection, those who have had multiple failures of aortic grafts, and patients for whom abdominal exploration would be hazardous.",

    "abstract": "To better understand the prognosis of atheroembolic disease, we reviewed the outcomes of 41 patients with embolization to the viscera and lower extremities.\nAll cases involved emboli that originated from a radiographically identified proximal arterial source. There were 30 men and 11 women (mean age 65 years; mean follow-up time 2 years), and all had been first treated for this condition within the past 6 years. The overall mortality rate was 17% (7/41) and the rate of recurrent embolization 15% (6/41). To compare outcomes associated with supradiaphragmatic versus subdiaphragmatic disease, we defined two groups: group 1 comprised patients (n = 5) in whom the identified embolic source extended above the diaphragm, and group 2 comprised patients (n = 36) in whom the source remained below the diaphragm. The mortality rates in groups 1 and 2 were 60% (3/5) and 11% (4/36), respectively (p < 0.05). Recurrent embolization was also significantly higher in group 1 (60% vs 8%, p < 0.025). There were two amputations in group 1 and six in group 2 (p = not significant). Group 2 patients were then divided into two subgroups: those with limited disease (n = 19) in which the emboli had a single, radiographically identified source (i.e., aneurysm or single area of ulcerated plaque) and those with diffuse disease (n = 17) in which the emboli had multiple, radiographically identified potential sources. In the subgroup of patients with limited disease, no deaths or episodes of recurrent embolization occurred, whereas four deaths and three episodes of recurrent embolization occurred in the subgroup of patients with diffuse disease. The differences in these outcomes, however, were not statistically significant. Thirty selected patients (one from group 1 and 29 from group 2) underwent operation on or bypass of the imputed lesion. Only one (7%) of these 30 patients had recurrent embolization. In contrast, recurrent embolization was noted in four (36%) of the 11 patients who did not have an operation directed at the lesion (p < 0.025). No significant difference in mortality was found between patients who underwent operation and those who did not.\nPatients with atheroemboli have a substantial mortality rate and risk of recurrent embolization, especially if the disease process extends above the diaphragm; but in selected patients, operation may decrease the frequency of recurrence without increasing mortality.",

    "abstract": "Heparin may have protective effects on postischemic vascular endothelial cell function that are distinct from its anticoagulant, antiplatelet, or anticomplement activity. We tested this hypothesis in isolated rat hindlimbs.\nIsolated rat hindlimbs underwent 60 minutes of normothermic ischemia and 10 minutes of reperfusion. Potential heparin interaction with plasma-based proteins or cells was eliminated by perfusion of the hindlimbs with a nonrecirculated albumin-enriched crystalloid buffer. Endothelial function was assessed by measurement of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) activity. Limbs perfused at constant pressure were subjected to increasing log dose infusions of acetylcholine and nitroprusside to measure endothelial-dependent (EDRF-mediated) and endothelial-independent vasoreactivity, respectively. Fifty limbs were divided into seven groups: two nonischemic groups (one with heparin) and five ischemia/reperfusion groups treated with increasing doses of heparin (0 to 1.0 U/ml perfusate).\nThe nontreated ischemia/reperfusion group (n = 12) had a 46.2% reduction in endothelial-dependent vasodilation of the rat hindlimb when compared with the nonischemic control (n = 7, p < 0.05). Treatment with heparin 0.5 U/ml (n = 6) nearly abolished this attenuation of endothelial-dependent vasodilation (4.3% reduction, p = not significant vs nonischemic control). The endothelial protective effect of heparin was dose-dependent: groups treated with 0.25 U/ml (n = 6) and 0.1 U/ml heparin (n = 7) showed progressive impairment in postischemic EDRF-mediated vasodilation. Endothelial-independent vasodilation induced by nitroprusside was unchanged by ischemia/reperfusion or heparin treatment, which confirmed that the postischemic damage and its protection by heparin were specific to the endothelium.\nHeparin prevented postischemic endothelial cell dysfunction by a mechanism independent of its interactions with plasma-based proteins or cells. This nonanticoagulant protective effect may contribute to the salutary effects of heparinization during acute ischemic events.",

    "abstract": "Because the platelet membrane receptor glycoprotein IIb/IIIa plays a central role in the recruitment of platelets into forming thrombus, therapeutic inhibition of this receptor complex may be particularly useful to prevent thrombosis after small vessel arterial manipulation.\nThe relative hemostatic safety and antithrombotic efficacy for thrombus formation at sites of endarterectomy and implanted prosthetic vascular graft of a murine monoclonal antibody (LJ-CP8) against platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa have been determined in baboons after bolus injections in doses (10 mg/kg) that block platelet receptor function for fibrinogen and other adhesive glycoproteins (absent platelet aggregation and bleeding times > 30 minutes without affecting circulating platelet counts).\nThrombus formation was eliminated by LJ-CP8 at sites of surgical endarterectomy in fresh segments of homologous aorta incorporated into chronic exteriorized arteriovenous femoral shunts (accumulation of indium 111-labeled platelets fell from 4.40 +/- 0.89 x 10(9) platelets/cm in control animals [n = 6] to 0.23 +/- 0.01 x 10(9) platelets/cm in treated animals [n = 4]; p < 0.005). The formation of thrombus was also abolished by LJ-CP8 at sites of 1 cm prosthetic vascular grafts (4 mm inner diameter polytetrafluoroethylene grafts) interposed into common carotid arteries (deposition of indium 111-labeled platelets decreased from 2.57 +/- 0.43 x 10(9) platelets/cm [n = 5] to 0.16 +/- 0.06 x 10(9) platelets/cm, [n = 4]; p = 0.004). However, LJ-CP8 injections produced substantial bleeding in the surgical wound during the first few hours after operation. Thirty days after operation all four graft implants were patent in JJ-CP8-treated animals compared with two of five in control animals (p = 0.06).\nWe conclude that profound inhibition of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor function by single bolus injection of LJ-CP8 monoclonal antibody transiently abolishes platelet hemostatic function, eliminates acute thrombus formation at sites of endarterectomy and prosthetic vascular graft implants, and may improve vascular patency.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare the conduct and early results of infrainguinal vascular reconstructions with use of ancrod or heparin for anticoagulation.\nTo test the hypothesis that ancrod was an effective alternative to heparin, 28 patients requiring infrainguinal bypass surgery were randomized to receive heparin during operation or ancrod before operation over a period of 12 hours to deplete circulating fibrinogen (0.2 to 0.5 gm/L).\nNo clotting of blood within the grafts or native vessels was noted during the conduct of the surgical procedures in either group. No excessive bleeding was detected during operation in either group. The operative procedure, complication rate, and hospital course were also indistinguishable; patency at 1 month was also equal.\nFibrinogen depletion with ancrod provides anticoagulation for the conduct of infrainguinal vascular reconstructions that is as effective as heparin.

    "abstract": "Captopril renal scintigraphy (CRS) is a nuclear medicine technique for evaluating each kidney independently for changes in glomerular filtration rate and perfusion induced by captopril-associated alterations in vascular tone. This study was undertaken to determine the role of CRS in predicting the response to renal revascularization.\nThe study group consisted of all patients who underwent preintervention CRS and arteriography, followed by renal revascularization performed between December 1987 and February 1992. After cessation of administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for 48 hours, a standard renogram was obtained, a 50 mg dose of captopril was given, and a second renogram was obtained. A captopril-induced change in the renogram was present when a normal pre-captopril renogram became abnormal after captopril administration. An abnormal baseline scan by definition cannot have a captopril-induced change. Blood pressure before revascularization was compared with blood pressure at 3 to 6 months after the procedure according to American Heart Association criteria for hypertension response.\nFifty patients received renal revascularization by operation (28 patients) or balloon angioplasty (22 patients). Preoperative captopril-induced changes were present in 29 of the 50 patients. Among the 29 patients with captopril-induced changes, hypertension was cured or improved in 26. When captopril-induced changes were not present, only one of 21 patients improved (p < 0.00001).\nOn the basis of these data, CRS appears to reliably predict hypertension response to revascularization in patients with renovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "This study compares the actual cost of performing noninvasive laboratory studies with reimbursement under the previous Medicare Part B system and under current resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS) guidelines.\nWe calculated the cost to operate our own laboratory and estimated national costs for small- and large-model laboratories. Reimbursement under Medicare Part B was calculated for each Current Procedural Terminology code from average Medicare reimbursement allowances and national case volumes in 1990, which were obtained from the Health Care Financing Administration. All data were expressed as dollars per hour of study time to allow universal comparison of costs and reimbursement among tests that require differing lengths of time for completion.\nTechnical costs for laboratory time ranged from $143 to $173 per study hour. The largest components of laboratory expenses were fixed costs, including personnel (37% to 46%), equipment (30% to 42%), and facilities (6% to 8%). Variable costs such as billing (9% to 10%) accounted for most of the remainder. More efficient allocation of equipment resulted in lower costs in large laboratories, whereas continued use of depreciated equipment resulted in lower costs in our own laboratory ($127/hr).\nWe project that technical reimbursement under RBRVS will be $82/hr nationally and $80/hr locally, whereas global reimbursement (technical plus professional) will be $116/hr and $110/hr, respectively. On the basis of 1990 case volumes, the RBRVS system will decrease national global reimbursement by at least 35% compared with the previous Medicare Part B system. Under the new system, technical reimbursement will decrease by an estimated 27% nationally, whereas professional reimbursement will decrease by 52%. Revenue under RBRVS will not meet the cost to perform studies either nationally or locally. Technical reimbursement is 37% to 54% below actual technical costs, and even global reimbursement is 13% to 34% less than technical costs. Our analysis revealed that costs will exceed reimbursement despite maximization of operating efficiency. This analysis applies to outpatients only. A case mix including inpatients will further reduce reimbursement, because only the professional component is allowed. By setting reimbursement of vascular laboratories below actual costs, the new RBRVS system may ultimately reduce the availability of noninvasive vascular testing for elderly patients.",

    "abstract": "Aspirin therapy is recommended commonly for symptomatic extracranial carotid artery occlusive disease. However, its role in the management of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis has not been reported previously.\nIn 11 clinical centers during the period 1983 to 1991, 444 adult male patients with significant asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (> or = 50% arteriographically) were randomized to receive optimal medical management including aspirin plus carotid endarterectomy (n = 211) or optimal medical management alone (n = 233). At the conclusion of the study (mean follow-up time 47.9 months), at the time of a patient's death, or at occurrence of a neurologic end point, 16% of patients (n = 72) were not taking any aspirin, 51% (n = 226) had been converted to receiving enteric-coated aspirin, and only 33% (n = 146) were taking plain aspirin (27% at reduced dosage). Among patients from the medical group, 37 (16%) of 233 were not taking any aspirin and formed the basis for this retrospective analysis of the group for which no control population was available.\nMortality rates in this group were not significantly different for patients not taking aspirin as compared with the rates for those taking aspirin, although patients not taking aspirin had a higher incidence of myocardial infarction (27%) as compared with patients taking aspirin (8%), p < 0.05. The incidence of ipsilateral neurologic events for patients not taking aspirin as compared with that for patients who were taking aspirin, respectively, was as follows: stroke, 13.5% and 8.7%, p > 0.05; stroke and transient ischemic attack, 37.8% and 17.3%, p < 0.05. No significant differences were observed in stroke severity scores for patients taking or not taking aspirin.\nThese data suggest that patients with significant asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis who are intolerant of aspirin have a higher incidence of neurologic events than those patients able to tolerate the drug.",

    "abstract": "A patient with a large abdominal aortic aneurysm was noted to have a congenital pelvic kidney. The patient also had bilateral iliac aneurysms that required repair. The blood supply of the congenital pelvic kidney was not apparent from preoperative studies but was found at the time of surgery to be from the area of the aortic bifurcation. Pelvic renal ischemia was limited by a \"double proximal clamping\" technique and by placement of a temporary shunt from the body of the aortic graft into the pelvic renal artery during completion of two distal anastomoses. The patient's renal function remained normal during the perioperative period, and the reconstruction was demonstrated to be patent more than one year after surgery. Although simple clamping and expeditious reconstruction are appropriate in most cases of aortic surgery in the presence of congenital or transplant pelvic kidney, more complex anatomy, including iliac aneurysms, may require longer periods of ischemia. Pelvic renal ischemia may be limited with the technique described.",

We report four patients in whom splenic infarctions developed after SRB. Splenic infarction developed in one patient at the time of SRB, and symptoms of splenic abscess (fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis) that proved to be splenic infarctions at laparotomy developed in three patients 2 to 16 days after the operation. Factors possibly contributing to splenic infarction could be determined for three patients. These included interruption of collateral vessels, intraoperative hypotension and disseminated intravascular coagulation, and distal splenic artery ligation. Normal Doppler flow was detected in the splenic parenchyma during test occlusions of the splenic artery before SRB in three patients. Our experience suggests that existing collateral circulation may not always sustain splenic viability after SRB, and some patients may not be suitable candidates for this operation. Factors such as adequacy of inflow, splenic artery length, and risk of perioperative hypotension should be considered.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to establish ultrasonographic criteria for the normal size of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries in patients without vascular disease.\nThe luminal diameters of the proximal and distal abdominal aorta and the common iliac arteries were measured by ultrasonography in 160 patients (15 to 89 years) who were without known vascular disease.\nIn patients above 50 years of age the distal aorta, which most often is involved in aneurysmatic dilations, measured 16.8 +/- 2.9 mm in men and 14.6 +/- 1.9 mm in women (p < 0.001). The diameter of the iliac artery in these patients was 10.1 +/- 2.0 mm in men and 9.2 +/- 1.3 mm in women (p < 0.001). The usually present gradual narrowing of the aorta toward the bifurcation was replaced by a slight increase (1 to 2 mm) in 5% of the men and 6% of the women. Focal areas of aortic enlargement, however, were not observed. In multivariate analysis, including age, height, body weight, and sex, the distal aortic diameter was significantly correlated only to age (r = 0.46; p < 0.001) and sex (r = -0.29; p < 0.001). With aging the mean of the proximal and distal aortic diameters increased by 0.08 and 0.05 mm/yr, respectively. Also correlated with age was a linear reduction in systolic expansion (r = -0.73; p < 0.001).\nEnlargement of the distal aorta and common iliac artery should be considered when (1) the luminal diameters in men exceed 23 and 14 mm, respectively, and in women 19 and 12 mm, respectively, (2) the ratio of the proximal and distal aortic diameter exceeds 1.1, and (3) there is demonstration of focal enlargement.",

We have attempted to determine the relative value and accuracy of available techniques to develop a logical strategy of investigation in reflux venous insufficiency.\nThe morphologic distribution of venous incompetence (erect duplex and descending venography); the results of ambulatory venous pressure measurement, venous refilling time, the Valsalva test, and air-plethysmography (venous refilling index, VFI); and the clinical severity were described in 118 consecutive limbs. In an attempt to validate the tests, results were correlated with the clinical severity classification (class 0, n = 34; class 1, n = 42; class 2, n = 11; class 3, n = 31) and with a standardized quantification of reflux (multisegment score) as seen on standing duplex Doppler scanning with rapid deflation cuffs.\nTwenty-nine percent of limbs with severe venous disease (class 2/3) had pure deep insufficiency, only 6% had pure superficial disease, and the remainder had a combination. A history of previous thrombosis and the presence of posterior tibial vein incompetence were markedly common with ulcer disease (84% and 42%, respectively). The duplex Doppler multisegment score correlated strongly with clinical severity classification (r = 0.97). The venous refilling time and VFI had the highest sensitivity in identifying severe venous disease (class 2/3), and the ambulatory venous pressure had excellent specificity.\nFor noninvasive determination of reflux, the combination of VFI and duplex scanning not only localized reflux but also separated severe clinical vein disease from mild, with high sensitivity and specificity. Air plethysmography may also provide valuable information regarding calf muscle pump and outflow obstruction.",

Outflow fraction and resistance were also measured after reactive hyperemia was induced.\nThe arm-foot venous pressure measurements delineated patients with grades 1 through 4 obstruction (Raju's grading). Resistance calculations correlated well with this grading except in patients with severe grade 4 obstruction, in whom low resistance was found. Outflow fraction determinations had marked overlapping between the different obstruction grades, substantially decreasing sensitivity to detect hemodynamically important outflow obstructions. No correlation with the resistance calculations was shown. Inducing reactive hyperemia did not alleviate these findings. The failure of the outflow fraction and resistance methods to detect significant obstruction is probably attributable to the use of plethysmographic techniques for volume measurement, which appears to give false-negative results as a result of a regional volume shift within the lower limb.\nThe combination of the arm-foot vein pressure differential and the foot vein pressure elevation after reactive hyperemia seems to be the only reliable test currently available for detecting and grading global chronic obstruction.",

DDMO was unsuccessful in one patient, whose session was terminated because of severe discomfort as a result of the procedure. All 10 patients with successfully thrombosed FFAs are without recurrence at 1-month follow-up color-flow duplex examination, and there has been no morbidity attributable to DDMO.\nWe conclude that DDMO of postcatheterization FFA can be performed safely and is an inexpensive, effective, nonoperative method of managing such lesions.

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of blood flow on the dimensions and cellular composition of normal arteries and freshly placed vein grafts (VG).\nBilateral jugular vein interposition grafts were placed in the common carotid arteries of 12 New Zealand white rabbits, and blood flow was reduced on one side by external carotid artery ligation. Shear stress, tangential stress, vessel dimensions, and smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation of reduced-flow arteries and VG were compared with these measures in contralateral controls (CON).\nA sustained reduction in blood flow was documented at 4 weeks (13 +/- 4 ml/min reduced-flow vs 21 +/- 4 ml/min CON; p < 0.05). Reduced-flow carotid arteries had a smaller lumen radius and greater medial thickness compared with normal-flow arteries, but there was no difference in medial cross-sectional area or medial SMC volume and no differences in any intimal measurements. These changes resulted in normalization of shear stress (15.2 +/- 4.6 dynes/cm2 reduced-flow vs 13.6 +/- 2.5 dynes/cm2 CON; p = NS). All VG underwent a marked postimplantation hyperplasia in intima and media, but the major effect of flow reduction on VG dimensions occurred in the intima. Intimal thickness in reduced-flow VG was 60% greater than that in control VG (57 +/- 12 microns vs 35 +/- 5 microns; p = 0.05), and intimal area was 70% greater than that in controls (0.83 +/- 0.24 microns 2 vs 0.48 +/- 0.08 microns 2; p > 0.05). Smaller differences were found in medial thickness (74 +/- 4 microns reduced-flow vs 63 +/- 4 microns CON; p = 0.02) and medial area (1.03 +/- 0.36 microns 2 reduced-flow vs 0.84 +/- 0.22 microns 2 CON; p = 0.05). Intimal SMC volume in reduced-flow VG was 37% greater than that in control VG (p = 0.07). Tangential stress in VG equaled that in ipsilateral arteries, whereas shear stress in VG remained much lower than that in arteries.\nIn this model, arteries and VG responded to flow reduction by wall thickening, but the mechanism differed. Arteries underwent medial remodeling, lumen caliber reduction, and shear stress normalization, whereas VG responded by an upward modulation of the proliferative response that follows graft placement. These data support a primary role for tangential stress and a secondary role for shear stress in determination of VG dimensions.",

    "abstract": "As the title suggests, this is an account of treating infected arterial grafts other than by the accepted methods of complete graft removal and revascularization with autogenous material or extraanatomic bypass.\nSince 1973, 42 patients with infected arterial grafts (n = 35) or autogenous reconstructions (n = 7) were seen with false aneurysm, hemorrhage, or perigraft or perianastomotic pus and were treated by removal of the infected graft and immediate adjacent or in situ revascularization by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in 39 cases and Dacron in three cases. Management plan included (1) removal of only the obviously infected part of the original graft, (2) obliteration of the infected anastomotic site, and (3) placement of the new PTFE graft in an adjacent clean or debrided route. So treated were 15 aortic Dacron grafts, 20 PTFE grafts (2 iliofemoral, 3 femorofemoral, and 15 femorodistal), and 7 autogenous reconstructions with bleeding. Partial graft salvage was attempted in 10 of 15 Dacron and 19 of 20 PTFE grafts.\nFour patients required further removal of the original infected graft (three Dacron, one PTFE), giving an ultimate success rate of 7 of 15 Dacron and 18 of 20 PTFE grafts; two patients required further obliteration of the original adjacent infected arterial segment because of rebleeding. An additional PTFE segment was joined successfully to incorporated PTFE in all six repeat operations. Initial failure did not prejudice the outcome; direct arterial flow to at least midthigh level was preserved in 37 of the 42 patients for a mean period of 40 months (range 9 to 130 months). Three of the new PTFE grafts occluded and became infected, which led to amputation and one death at a secondary operation. Visceral complications caused the only two other deaths in the aortic group. Five late amputations (four below the knee and one above the knee) were required because of femorodistal graft occlusion.\nPartial removal of infected grafts with adjacent or in situ replacement by PTFE is possible, simplifies management, and permits maintenance of distal circulation with low morbidity and mortality rates.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to assess the healing qualities of presealed knitted polyester prostheses.\nThoracic aortic replacement was performed with grafts with four different coating materials-collagen (CP), albumin (AP), and two with gelatin (GP1/GP2)-in four groups of 15 pigs each. Two weeks, 6 weeks, and 6 months after operation, five pigs of each group were killed. Healing quality was assessed by morphometric analysis of the remaining coating, the extent of tissue ingrowth, and the thickness of the inner layer.\nThe sealant was rapidly absorbed in all prostheses except for the AP (remaining coating at 2 weeks: GP1 22.1%, GP2 34.7%, and CP 68.0% vs AP 97.1% [p < 0.05]), remaining coating at 6 weeks: GP1/GP2 0% and CP 2.5% vs AP 76.7% (p < .01). At 6 months, remaining coating was only detectable in AP (21.5%). At 2 weeks the extent of tissue ingrowth ranged from 65.7% in GP1 and 75.3% in CP to 80% in GP2 versus 8.9% in AP (p < 0.05). There was a slow increase of tissue ingrowth until the sixth postoperative week (GP1 74.4%, GP2 85.0%, and CP 91.3% versus AP 19.6% [p < 0.01]). Thickness of the internal layer varied from 0.11 to 0.21 mm at 2 weeks in all grafts studied and from 1.02 mm (AP) and 1.28 mm (GP2) to 1.39 mm (GP1), versus 0.41 mm in the CP (p < 0.01) after 6 months of implantation.\nThe type of coating significantly influences the healing properties of knitted polyester prostheses. When used for thoracic aortic replacement in pigs, AP coating clearly results in inferior healing compared with GP1/GP2 or CP impregnation, with digestion of the coating material and tissue ingrowth used as parameters. The thinnest internal layer was found in the CP prostheses, reflecting superior healing properties of this coating in the model studied.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism by which some graft materials are more thrombogenic than others is poorly understood. We hypothesized that differential induction of macrophage procoagulant activity (PCA) by various materials may contribute to variable thrombogenicity.\nThioglycollate-elicited murine peritoneal macrophages were added to disks of Dacron and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). After adherence, macrophages were incubated with and without endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) and then recovered by sonication for determination of PCA with a one-step clotting bioassay.\nPCA was significantly higher in cells after incubation on Dacron compared with ePTFE both in the absence of lipopolysaccharide (243 +/- 76 vs 68 +/- 39 mU, n = 4) and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (491 +/- 137 vs 139 +/- 41 mU, n = 4) (p < 0.01, analysis of variance). Using factor-deficient plasmas, we found that this PCA was consistent with tissue factor. This differential induction of PCA was related to increased macrophage adherence to Dacron compared to that to ePTFE (9374 +/- 1158 vs 2111 +/- 330 cells/mm2; n = 4; p < 0.01, analysis of variance).\nThe thrombogenic nature of Dacron correlates with its ability to adhere macrophages and induce PCA. Strategies aimed at modulating these effects may reduce the thrombogenicity of vascular grafts and therefore potentially the incidence of graft thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "The improvement of management strategies in patients with intermittent claudication might depend on a better understanding of the natural history of femoral atherosclerosis. The grading of stenoses, the monitoring of their progression, and the assessment of response to treatment are critically dependent on a method's accuracy and variability. Duplex ultrasound imaging provides a noninvasive way of measuring localized disease, but there has been relatively little objective evaluation of its accuracy and reproducibility. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and variability of duplex velocity ratio measurements of stenosis.\nIn a laboratory flow model of the femoral artery, 14 concentric and eccentric stenoses were examined five times by three sonographers. Measurements were then repeated with a standardized technique in which Doppler angle and aperture position were fixed, giving a total of 420 measurements.\nVelocity ratio showed good correlation with degree of stenosis, R2 = 0.996. Intraobserver variability was low, but interobserver variability was significant with more severe stenosis (p = 0.002, analysis of variance). Standardization of the technique did not improve accuracy or variability. The 95% confidence limit was +/- 20% for a single reading of velocity ratio for stenoses of > 50% diameter reduction.\nWe conclude that duplex ultrasound imaging can be used to accurately grade arterial stenosis in this range, and the potential exists for noninvasive monitoring of the progression of preocclusive femoral atherosclerosis and its response to treatment.

    "abstract": "This report compares patients with the hypercoagulable state of polycythemia vera to patients with secondary polycythemia caused by tobacco use to determine whether the incidence of thromboembolic events is equivalent.\nThe medical records of 146 patients with the diagnosis of polycythemia between 1977 to 1990 were reviewed. Patients with transient, relative, or stress polycythemia were excluded from this study as were patients with polycythemia as a result of cardiac or pulmonary anomalies or both. The diagnosis of polycythemia vera (n = 43) was verified by use of the guidelines of the Polycythemia Vera Study Group. The diagnosis of polycythemia caused by smoking (n = 27) was based on an elevated total red blood cell volume, decreased oxygen saturation on arterial blood gas measurement, evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels.\nTwenty-six patients (60%) with polycythemia vera and 11 patients (41%) with smoker's polycythemia had at least one thromboembolic problem. No significant differences existed between the groups with regard to age, hematocrit, or number of cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Overall, patients with polycythemia vera had a greater number of thromboembolic events per patient (p < 0.05) and more peripheral arterial thromboemboli (p < 0.005) than did patients with polycythemia as a result of smoking (Fisher's Exact Test).\nThus the results of this study demonstrate that smokers' polycythemia does not represent a hypercoagulable state equivalent to that of polycythemia vera.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of Doppler waveform characteristics in grading femoropopliteal stenoses and to determine the interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility of measuring the same waveform characteristics.\nThirty patients with isolated areas of stenosis found by arteriography were evaluated by color duplex sonography. Each patient underwent scanning by two observers on two separate occasions. Each observer was blind to the other's results. Doppler spectra were recorded in areas where color change suggested the highest velocity and also at the nearest normal proximal area. Peak systolic velocity, spectral broadening, and waveform configuration were measured at each site.\nAn increase in peak systolic velocity of more than 200% accurately predicted a 50% or greater reduction in luminal diameter on angiography (70% sensitivity, 96% specificity). The presence of spectral broadening and an abnormal waveform shape were found to correlate poorly with the degree of stenosis. Analysis of variance showed no significant difference between observers in velocity measurements (p = 0.78).\nWe conclude that although stenoses of greater than 50% can be distinguished from minor stenoses, more precise definition of the degree of narrowing is unlikely. The good repeatability of the velocity ratio makes it an excellent tool for monitoring major changes in the progression of disease.",

    "abstract": "Until recently, the accepted management of life-threatening complications of unresectable cervicofacial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has been ligation of the major feeding vessels, usually the branches or the main trunk of the external carotid artery. Rapid enlargement of collateral vessels around the ligature is usually associated with an early return of symptoms. Percutaneous transcatheter embolization of the nidus of the arteriovenous malformation is now the preferred treatment for symptomatic AVMs that cannot be excised. Previous ligation of the main feeding vessels prevents catheter access and embolization therapy of the lesion. The purpose of this report is to describe our experience with the treatment of patients with symptomatic unresectable cervicofacial AVMs and previous external carotid artery ligation.\nSix patients with symptoms from cervicofacial arteriovenous malformations required surgical reconstruction of their previously ligated external carotid artery with the anticipation of catheter embolization therapy to the branch vessels feeding the malformation. Saphenous vein was used in five reconstructions; a polytetrafluoroethylene graft was used in one.\nAfter successful arterial reconstruction, massive swelling of the tongue and perioral tissue developed in two patients, which necessitated tracheostomy in one patient; and embolization therapy before extubation could be safely performed in the other patient. In all, four patients underwent successful embolization therapy. One refused subsequent treatment. In one patient with severe epistaxis, external carotid artery revascularization led to the healing of the nasal ulcers without need for embolization therapy.\nFor patients with previous ligations of the external carotid artery and symptomatic AVMs, revascularization of the external carotid artery is an important step in treatment. The surgery must be carefully coordinated with the interventional radiologist for possible emergency postoperative embolization therapy. External carotid artery ligation only complicates the treatment of patients with cervicofacial AVMs, and should no longer be used in the treatment of these individuals.",

The validity of the test was determined in 91 cases identified by the presence of intermittent claudication and a low resting ankle pressure and in 91 controls matched by age and sex.\nThe mean postocclusive ankle index was 0.98 (SD 0.20), and the mean drop in ankle pressure was 9.89% (SD 12.79%). In examining the validity of the test, differences occurred in the two ways of expressing the results: the postocclusive ankle index was 90% sensitive and 97% specific and the percentage drop in ankle pressure was 52% sensitive and 86% specific in detecting disease. The postocclusive ankle index increased the overall identification of cases in the Edinburgh Artery Study from 6.5% to 11.5%, but the percentage drop in ankle pressure increased identification to only 9.5%.

    "abstract": "The ability of ultrasonic tissue characterization based on radiofrequency signal processing to detect compositional differences in thrombi of varying ages was evaluated in vivo.\nThrombi were produced in 49 jugular veins of 26 anesthetized 18 to 20 kg pigs by partial ligation and application of direct electric current. Thrombi were imaged 30 minutes after formation and 1, 7, and 14 days later with a color Doppler ultrasound scanner that identified the thrombi, and acquired radio frequency data for ultrasonic tissue characterization analysis. Ultrasonic tissue characterization used two parameters from the normalized power spectrum, slope, and intercept, which are related to scatterer size, scatterer concentration, and acoustic-impedance differences between scatterers and surrounding medium. Previous in vitro studies demonstrated that lower slope and higher intercept values correlated with greater cellularity and more-dense fibrin mesh. Histologic examination was performed for each time period. The values of slope and intercept for each timed observation were compared by a multilinear discriminant analysis.\nThere were no statistical differences between day 0 and day 1. Statistically-significant differences in ultrasonic tissue characterization parameters were seen between all other time intervals with p values < 0.01. Older thrombi tended to demonstrate higher slope and lower intercept values. These ultrasonic tissue characterization changes correlated with a red cell and fibrin-mesh density reduction, which was confirmed by histologic findings and was indicative of partial spontaneous thrombolysis. The degree of spontaneous thrombolysis provides an estimate of the age of thrombi.\nUltrasonic tissue characterization is capable of distinguishing age differences in thrombi in an animal model and has the potential for noninvasive application in clinical diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the factors determining postexercise pressure and the relationship of venous valve closure and venous column segmentation to ambulatory venous pressure changes.\nValve closure and venous segmentation were observed during dynamic ascending phlebography in 40 nonrefluxive limbs and by duplex imaging in 25 normal limbs in healthy volunteers. Simultaneous volume (air plethysmography) and pressure studies during calf exercise were also carried out. Some studies used a simple mechanical model comprised of a collapsible latex tube (\"calf pump\") and a graduated \"popliteal\" valve.\nThe femoropopliteal venous column above the popliteal valve remains unsegmented and continuous during ambulatory venous pressure changes in response to calf muscle contraction. Therefore ambulatory venous pressure changes cannot be explained purely on the basis of hydrostatic column pressure changes. Postexercise pressure appears to be determined by a complex set of factors: (1) physical segmentation of the venous column below the popliteal valve (i.e., tibial valve closure); (2) tube collapse below the closed valve, which further aids in the breakup of the hydrostatic column pressure and dampens the effect of any reflux through or around the closed valve; (3) ejection fraction, which influences the degree of tube collapse; and (4) the interaction of the resultant pressure forces with the wall properties of the venous pump.\nThe mechanism of ambulatory venous pressure reduction is complex and multifactorial. The importance of venous wall characteristics as a determinant of postexercise pressure has not been previously appreciated. Changes in venous wall property after a thrombotic process, for example, could conceivably influence ambulatory venous pressure and recovery time in the absence of reflux.",

The pseudoaneurysm occurred 1 year after insertion of the graft and was not associated with any direct trauma. It manifested with a painful tender mass at the top of the body of the axillofemoral bypass graft at the level of the nipple line. There were no symptoms of localized or diffuse sepsis. Immediate surgical exploration confirmed the diagnosis of a pseudoaneurysm of the ePTFE graft. Successful repair of the disrupted segment was accomplished by use of an interposition, nonringed, reinforced, thin-walled, 8 mm ePTFE graft.

    "abstract": "Based on the excellent results of experimental studies with antibiotic-bonded vascular prostheses for prevention of graft infection, gelatin-sealed grafts soaked with rifampin were implanted in situ in five patients with vascular infection. All patients were at risk for limb loss or death and could not be treated by standard techniques such as graft excision and extra-anatomic bypass. In one patient an infected aortic stump aneurysm with involvement of both renal and visceral arteries was found. He was treated by implantation of a bifurcation rifampin-soaked graft between the subdiaphragmal aorta and both renal arteries and reimplantation of celiac and superior mesenteric artery into the graft. In four patients with in-flow or runoff problems on angiography, an antibiotic-soaked graft was used for replacement of a partially or totally infected graft. Cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus in three and coagulase-negative staphylococci in two patients. Wound healing was uncomplicated; there was no need for amputation. After a follow-up of at least 6 months, all grafts were patent without any evidence of reinfection on computed tomographic scan. We conclude that infected vascular prostheses can be replaced in situ by rifampin-soaked grafts in patients at high risk for death or major amputation.",

    "abstract": "One of the most important aspects of Beh\u00e7et's disease is aneurysmal arteriopathy. The major problem of this complication is its tendency to develop recurrent false aneurysms at anastomotic and traumatic sites, such as angiographic punctures. We present a clinical case in which five aneurysms, some true, some false, were operated on during a period of 6 years, with the aid of ultrastructural observations of the wall of a true and a false aneurysm. One of the true aneurysms, localized in the aorta, was treated by direct aneurysmorrhaphy, and the 6-year follow-up demonstrated the absence of recurrences. Based on both this experience and the data in the literature, we suggest that the most appropriate surgical approach would, when possible, be direct aneurysmorrhaphy.",

    "abstract": "In children with chronic renal failure, vascular access for hemodialysis is difficult because of the small size of the vessels and the requirement for substantial blood flow through the fistula or graft. As the child grows older, the ease of constructing a satisfactory access usually increases as the vessels increase in size. Unfortunately, this increased ease is often offset by the paucity of suitable access sites because the larger peripheral sites have already been used with only transient success. We report a child with chronic renal failure since 1 month of age with no peripheral sites available because of prior failed procedures who underwent placement of polytetrafluoroethylene limbs to the aorta and vena cava at the age of 6 years. He has continued on hemodialysis for the past 4 1/2 years with this technique of vascular access.",

    "abstract": "Detection of mesenteric arterial insufficiency is clinically difficult, and diagnosis frequently requires arteriography. Advances in duplex scanning make this an ideal technique to noninvasively screen patients for chronic mesenteric arterial occlusive disease. However, the accuracy of mesenteric duplex scanning compared with arteriography remains unclear. This study will clearly define the accuracy of abdominal duplex scanning for detection of mesenteric arterial insufficiency.\nThe mesenteric duplex scans of 38 patients obtained over a 4-year period were reviewed and compared with lateral aortograms to clarify this issue. Optimal peak systolic frequency (PSF) for predicting less than 50% or 50% or greater stenoses of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and celiac axis (CA) were determined from receiver-operating characteristic curves.\nIn the SMA a PSF of 4.5 kHz was 96% sensitive (24/25), 92% specific (12/13), and 95% accurate (36/38) at predicting stenoses less than 50% or 50% or greater. For arteries with stenoses 50% to 99%, regression analysis demonstrated excellent linear correlation between percent stenosis and PSF (r = 0.89). In the CA a PSF of 4.0 kHz had a sensitivity of 100% (30/30), a specificity of 88% (7/8), and an accuracy of 97% (37/38). Again, for arteries with stenoses 50% to 99%, an excellent linear correlation existed between PSF and percent stenosis (r = 0.86). All total arterial occlusions (14) were correctly identified. In all, mesenteric arterial duplex scanning was 96% accurate for predicting SMA and CA stenoses/occlusions.\nAbdominal duplex scanning is a noninvasive technique that accurately detects total occlusions and objectively quantitates SMA and CA arterial stenoses.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of atherosclerosis can be studied before development of symptomatic plaque by evaluating morphologic changes of the intima-media (I-M) complex, seen on high-resolution ultrasonography of the arterial wall. These qualitative changes require large alterations in vessel wall appearance to recognize progression of atherosclerosis. It has been suggested that measurement of the thickness of the I-M complex may be a quantitative and more sensitive method of assessing these early atherosclerotic changes.\nHigh-resolution ultrasonography has been used to measure the thickness of the I-M complex in 140 symptom-free subjects.\nThe mean thickness of the I-M complex of the common carotid arteries was linearly related to the age (r = 0.77; p < 0.001), pack-years of smoking (r = 0.39; p < 0.05), the systolic blood pressure (r = 0.51, p < 0.01), and to the arterial ultrasound score (r = 0.85). The arterial ultrasound score has previously been shown to correlate with the presence of asymptomatic myocardial ischemia and with the development of cardiovascular symptoms. The mean thickness of the I-M complex in subjects without plaque (in the common carotid or common femoral artery bifurcations) was significantly thinner than in subjects with plaque (p < 0.001).\nThe thickness of the I-M complex of the common carotid arteries is a measure of the risk for the development of cardiovascular symptoms in symptom-free individuals.",

    "abstract": "Human vascular prostheses develop a pseudointima that after time is devoid of a complete endothelial lining. The composition of this pseudointima consists of both cellular and noncellular components such as coagulation proteins and extracellular matrix proteins. Of these extracellular molecules, type V collagen has been reported to be localized to surfaces of vascular prostheses. We have hypothesized that type V collagen may be involved in the mechanisms of inhibition of endothelialization on vascular prostheses. In this study, interactions of human protein and cells with clinically used material and reference surfaces were analyzed in vitro.\nHuman collagen types IV and V or human fibronectin was coated on disks punched from expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, bacteriologic polystyrene, and tissue culture-treated polystyrene. Fibronectin adsorbed equally to these surfaces, but differential adsorption of type V collagen occurred. The attachment and growth of human saphenous vein and umbilical vein endothelial cells and of human skin fibroblasts were also evaluated on protein-coated or uncoated surfaces. Type IV collagen and fibronectin promoted the attachment of these cells, but type V collagen reduced cellular adhesion. Growth of endothelial cells was significantly inhibited on surfaces coated with type V collagen even when additional growth substances such as serum, retinal-derived growth factor, and heparin were present in the medium. Human adult dermal fibroblast adhesion and cell growth were not affected by coating the surfaces with type V collagen.\nThe components of the extracellular matrix of the pseudointima may directly influence endothelial cells by inhibiting cell proliferation, migration from within the graft or from anastomoses, or both. Type V collagen, a matrix protein found at luminal surfaces of vascular prostheses, may be one protein responsible for control of endothelial responses.",

Inflammatory change was diagnosed correctly in seven of 15 patients, whereas six NIAAs were falsely diagnosed as inflammatory. MRI successfully diagnosed neck level and inflammatory change in all cases. Of two failures to visualize the renal artery origins, only one was caused by radiologic factors.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of a modified abdominal ultrasound examination, which was performed at the time of routine diagnostic carotid artery duplex evaluation, to identify patients at risk for aortic aneurysms.\nA prospective study was undertaken that consisted of a limited ultrasound examination of the abdominal aorta on patients referred to our facilities for duplex carotid evaluation. One hundred thirty-one patients were included in the study; 52% were men and 48% were women, who ranged in age between 40 to 93 years. These patients were not known or suspected to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nEleven infrarenal aortic aneurysms (8.4%) were detected, four in patients with positive carotid studies (11%) and seven in those with negative studies (7%); size ranged from 3.0 to 7.5 cm. Categoric data analysis did not produce significance, but a stepwise regression and discriminant analysis model revealed a significant relationship between abnormal velocities and occlusive changes in the carotid arteries and the presence of aortic aneurysms.\nHemodynamically significant carotid artery disease, as diagnosed by duplex examination, appears to be a definite marker for an increased incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm when compared with the general population. When selective abdominal aortic ultrasonography is done in conjunction with the carotid study, the requirements of additional equipment and technologist time are modest, and the potential benefit to the patient may be significant.",

    "abstract": "The current diagnostic criteria used to assess the severity of stenoses in the aortoiliac arteries by duplex scanning are mainly based on information related to changes in cross-sectional area and are flow independent. Consequently, duplex scanning fails to detect approximately one quarter of hemodynamically significant aortoiliac lesions compared with intraarterial pressure measurements. The aim of this study is to improve the assessment of the hemodynamic significance of aortoiliac lesions by duplex scanning.\nA prospective study in 60 patients was performed in which duplex scanning at rest was compared with intraarterial pressure measurements before and after the administration of papaverine. A simplified Bernoulli equation was used to calculate pressure gradients across stenoses (delta PBern). Two flow-related parameters, the increase in peak systolic velocity (delta PSV) across the stenosis and the end-diastolic velocity at the site of the stenosis, were also measured and compared with intraarterial pressure measurements.\ndelta PBern and delta PSV showed a sensitivity and specificity of 81% and 88%, respectively, for the detection of hemodynamically significant lesions at rest. However, delta PBern could often not give an accurate calculation of the pressure gradient. Receiver operator characteristic analysis showed that a cut-off level for delta PSV in the range of 1.4 to 1.5 m/s was best able to detect significant lesions at rest. The end-diastolic velocity parameter had a limited diagnostic value.\nAlthough useful in clinical decision making, delta PBern often could not give an accurate calculation of the pressure gradient. delta PSV is a simple and practical spectral analysis parameter to differentiate between significant and insignificant stenoses. This parameter also has the potential to detect hemodynamically less critical lesions if duplex scanning is performed under conditions of increased flow. Further evaluation is needed.",

    "abstract": "The role of leukocytes in tissue damage in the liposclerotic skin of venous disease has been investigated. Twenty-eight skin biopsy specimens were obtained from 23 patients with varicose veins of the lower limb, with a spectrum of skin injury ranging from normal to severe liposclerosis. In no patient was a venous ulcer present. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the cell types present and provide an indication of their activity. The predominant infiltrating cell types present were T lymphocytes and macrophages. B cells and neutrophils were rarely seen. As described previously, the capillaries were greatly increased in number in the papillary dermis and exhibited grossly increased expression of factor VIII-related antigen and major histocompatibility complex class II. Surprisingly, expression of adhesion molecules endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule were not elevated, but intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression did increase in more severely diseased skin. Perivascular fibrin was seen occasionally, but there was no evidence of microvascular occlusion. Staining for the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha was not increased in liposclerotic skin. Dermal staining for both interleukin (IL)-1 alpha and IL-1 beta was increased in severely liposclerotic skin, but this was not seen at an early stage. Epidermal staining for IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta was not increased. All changes were confined to the subpapillary region of the skin. These findings demonstrate that accumulation of macrophages and T cells is an event associated with the development of liposclerotic skin changes that may lead to ulceration in venous disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The neurologic effect of induced hyperglycemia in the postischemic period was investigated with a rat aortic occlusion model.\nSprague-Dawley rats weighing 200 to 350 gm were anesthetized, intubated, and ventilated with 1% to 1.5% halothane. Temperature was continuously monitored and maintained at 37 degrees +/- 0.5 degrees C. The chest was opened, the thymus excised, and the aortic arch exposed. Snares were placed around the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery and the right and left subclavian arteries. The three vessels thus isolated were occluded for 8 minutes. With snare release and withdrawal, the rats received an intraperitoneal injection of 5% dextrose in water (2 gm/kg) or an equivalent volume of 0.9% saline solution. In a second group of rats the administration of glucose or saline solution was delayed until 30 minutes after snare release. Blood samples for blood glucose determination were obtained before operation, before occlusion, immediately after occlusion, and 15, 30, 45, 60, and 240 minutes after occlusion. A neurologic deficit score was assigned at 1, 4, 18, and 24 hours after occlusion to quantify hindlimb neurologic deficit based on 15-point scale (0 = normal, 15 = severe deficit). Sham-operated rats received the same operation and injection, but the snares were only manipulated and not made occlusive.\nThe rats that were administered glucose immediately after snare release showed a statistically significant exacerbation of lower extremity neurologic deficit at 24 hours after occlusion (p < or = 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). The sham-operated rats were normal (0 score) at 24 hours. Significant elevation of blood glucose (321 +/- 33 mg/dl) was seen in the glucose-injected rats at 15 minutes and continued for up to 4 hours after occlusion (p = 0.040 and 0.014, respectively; Student's t test).\nPostischemic hyperglycemia immediately after a standard spinal cord ischemic stress worsens neurologic outcome.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article was to analyze the fluid mechanical effects of a side-to-end proximal anastomosis and to compare the results with those from our earlier study on the end-to-side distal anastomosis.\nThe photochromic tracer technique was used to determine the instantaneous wall shear stress and to visualize the overall flow field under pulsatile flow conditions. The flow consisted of a sinusoid plus a steady component with mean and modulation Reynolds numbers of 355 and 565, respectively, and a Womersley number of 7.9.\nAt the toe and heel of the junction, very high and positive wall shear stresses were seen together with substantial nonperiodic fluctuations. The peak wall shear stress was about four times higher at the toe and about seven times higher at the heel than the maximum values observed at about four tube diameters upstream from the junction. On the bed of the host vessel, nonperiodic fluctuations were also observed, but the shear stresses were mainly negative with magnitudes comparable to those seen upstream. With leakages of 11% and 28% of the mean flow through the blocked end of the host vessel, the shear stress pattern seemed to be significantly affected only at the toe for the higher leakage. Further, when the mean Reynolds number was reduced to 320, the magnitudes of the variations in the wall shear stress were reduced proportionately, except at the heel, where the reduction was much larger than expected.\nIt appears that the preferential development of intimal hyperplasia at the distal end-to-side anastomosis may be promoted by low wall shear stress at the toe and heel, and probably by high shear stresses or shear stress gradients on the bed.",

    "abstract": "Twenty-five infected infrarenal aortic aneurysms operated on between 1968 and 1989 were reviewed. They were classified into post-embolic (mycotic) aneurysms (group I), infective aortitis (group II), and infected atherosclerotic aneurysms (group III). Aortoduodenal fistulas were found in eight patients and aortocaval in two. Five patients were operated on in a state of shock, and 12 had preoperative positive blood cultures. Surgical procedures included in situ reconstruction of the aorta (n = 21) and extra-anatomic bypass associated with aneurysmal resection (n = 4). In 19 patients, prostheses were covered with omental flaps, and antibiotics were continued for more than 6 weeks in all patients. In patients who underwent in situ reconstruction, three deaths were related to the initial surgery. All surviving patients were regularly followed up, and none showed any sign of late septic recurrence. In patients who underwent extra-anatomic bypass, two died in the postoperative period, one underwent reoperation 2 years after the initial surgery, and the last patient is doing well. Positive postoperative blood cultures (n = 4) revealed persistent sepsis: two cholecystitis, one spondylitis, and one aortic infection. An exhaustive review of the literature was performed; clinical, bacteriologic, and operative features and results were analyzed; prognostic factors were evaluated; and a practical therapeutic approach was suggested. The importance of preoperative diagnosis, complete resection, debridement of infected tissues, omental flap coverage, and long-term antibiotic therapy with regular computerized tomographic scanning follow-up is stressed.",

There were 21 male and 12 female patients with a mean age of 60.6 years. Indications were intermittent claudication in 19, rest pain in nine, and ischemic ulcer/gangrene in seven limbs. There were 23 totally occluded (mean length 6 +/- 3.8 cm) and 12 stenotic arteries. LABA was achieved with a pulsed Nd:YAG laser with 10 to 25 W and a 2.2/3 mm sapphire probe, followed by balloon dilatation in all but four limbs.\nImmediate technical success (< or = 50% residual stenosis) was achieved in 27 (77%) of 35 limbs. Mean ankle/brachial index improved from 0.49 to 0.80 (p < 0.05). Major complications included three perforations, three dissections, and two emboli. Two additional limbs required operation at less than 30 days for a 30-day patency rate of 71.4%. Long-term clinical and noninvasive follow-up ranged from 1 to 55 months (mean 17.68 months). Twenty-nine angiograms were obtained from 3 to 49 months after LABA. Nineteen limbs underwent at least one angiogram, seven underwent two, and three limbs underwent three angiograms. Eleven of the 19 limbs showed evidence of restenosis greater than 50%, all within 12 months. The cumulative patency rate was 71.5% at 1 month, 39.7% at 6 months, and 31.3% at 12, 24, and 36 months.\nLABA with the Nd:YAG laser has a 30-day success rate of 71.4%. Angiographic follow-up demonstrates a high incidence of restenosis (> 50%), usually within 12 months. Approximately 50% of limbs eventually required reintervention within 1 year. In view of the disappointing early results, the use of LABA must remain strictly investigational.",

    "abstract": "Deterioration in renal function is a common cause of morbidity in patients treated surgically for juxtarenal and suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms. We reviewed our experience over the last 8 years with 65 consecutive patients undergoing juxtarenal (n = 31) or suprarenal (n = 34) abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.\nThe aneurysms were repaired with a transabdominal (n = 8), thoracoabdominal (n = 4), retroperitoneal (n = 22), or thoracoretroperitoneal (n = 31) approach. Proximal aortic clamps were placed at the suprarenal, supra-superior mesenteric artery, or supraceliac level. Renal hypothermia with cold heparinized saline solution renal artery perfusion was used to protect renal function in 38 patients with either preoperative renal insufficiency or with anticipated prolonged renal ischemia (> 30 minutes). Concomitant renal artery reconstruction was required in 30 patients.\nSignificant operative morbidity developed in 23 (35.3%) patients. There was one (1.53%) perioperative death (0 to 90 days). Temporary dialysis was necessary in two patients. Preoperative renal insufficiency was a significant risk factor on multivariate analysis for a decline in renal function during the first postoperative week. However, serum creatinine concentration had returned to baseline or improved in all patients but two (3.1%) at the time of discharge. In spite of significantly longer renal ischemia, discharge creatinine levels were, on univariate analysis, statistically less than baseline creatinine levels in patients with suprarenal aneurysms, patients requiring renal reconstruction, and patients treated with renal hypothermia. The location of the proximal aortic clamp was not a factor in postoperative morbidity. There was no significant difference between juxtarenal and suprarenal aneurysms with respect to operating room time, transfusion requirements, days intubated, resumption of oral diet, or the length of hospitalization.\nCareful consideration of the route of exposure, location of the proximal aortic clamp, and the preservation of renal function with renal hypothermia and with the repair of significant renal artery lesions will result in minimal morbidity and mortality in patients requiring surgery for juxtarenal or suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms.",

Preoperative renal insufficiency was a significant risk factor on multivariate analysis for a decline in renal function during the first postoperative week. However, serum creatinine concentration had returned to baseline or improved in all patients but two (3.1%) at the time of discharge. In spite of significantly longer renal ischemia, discharge creatinine levels were, on univariate analysis, statistically less than baseline creatinine levels in patients with suprarenal aneurysms, patients requiring renal reconstruction, and patients treated with renal hypothermia. The location of the proximal aortic clamp was not a factor in postoperative morbidity. There was no significant difference between juxtarenal and suprarenal aneurysms with respect to operating room time, transfusion requirements, days intubated, resumption of oral diet, or the length of hospitalization.",

    "abstract": "The coexistence of horseshoe kidney and aortic aneurysm poses a technical challenge to the vascular surgeon at the time of aneurysm repair. Clinical experience with this problem was reviewed to assess the results of treatment and to develop guidelines for the treatment of patients with horseshoe kidney and aortic aneurysm.\nFrom 1960 through 1991, 19 patients with associated horseshoe kidney (HSK) required repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm at the Cleveland Clinic. Seventeen men and two women, with a mean age of 67 years, underwent 16 elective and three urgent operations. The HSK was found before operation in 16 patients (84%), whereas the remaining three were discovered at operation. Computed tomography and intravenous pyelography were the most reliable means of preoperative diagnosis, whereas ultrasonography and aortography were less dependable. Mean size of abdominal aortic aneurysm was 6.1 cm. The mean preoperative creatinine level was 1.5 mg/dl. The surgical approach was transperitoneal in 16 patients and retroperitoneal in three. Division of the renal isthmus was avoided in all patients.\nRenal artery anomalies were encountered in 14 patients (74%). Renal arterial continuity was established by a variety of techniques, including branch grafts or reimplantation into the aortic graft. Abnormal preoperative renal function was associated with a significantly increased risk for early postoperative hemodialysis (p = 0.02). There were three postoperative deaths, and the mortality rate for patients who required dialysis (67%) was significantly higher (p = 0.05) than that for patients who did not (6.3%). There were six late deaths at a mean follow-up interval of 57 months.\nThe most important aspect of HSK, therefore, is the appropriate surgical management of frequent renal artery anomalies. We currently believe this is best achieved with retroperitoneal exposure.",

    "abstract": "This study tests the hypothesis that the absence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) on lower extremity color-flow venous duplex examination (LECFD) combined with a non-high-probability ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scanning results rules out pulmonary embolus (PE). The use of LECFD as a diagnostic aid for PE is based on data that show that 90% of PE originate from lower extremity DVT, and therefore on the assumption that PE cannot be present if DVT is not present as the source.\nOver a 3-year period 51 patients with clinically suspected PE underwent LECFD and pulmonary angiography (PA) within 72 hours of each other. Forty-one patients also underwent V/Q scanning during the same time period. The results of LECFD and V/Q scans were compared with the results of PA, the gold standard for the diagnosis of pulmonary emboli.\nResults of LECFD were positive for DVT in seven of 16 cases of angiographically documented PE. Thus the \"sensitivity\" of LECFD as a diagnostic aid in cases of suspected PE is 44%. The results of LECFD and V/Q scans were combined and compared with the results of PA. A high-probability V/Q scanning result was considered positive for PE. Intermediate- and low-probability scanning results were considered negative, because in the literature the decision to begin heparin therapy is not made on the basis of this result. The combination of test results was considered positive if either test result was positive and negative only if results of both were negative. With these criteria the combination of test results was positive in only 62% of cases of angiographically documented PE.\nIf treatment of suspected PE were based on LECFD alone or on duplex combined with V/Q scanning, 40% to 50% of patients with PE would remain untreated. In cases of suspected PE where these noninvasive tests do not confirm its presence, PA should be performed.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral vascular disease of the upper extremity as a result of atherosclerotic disease or systemic vascular disorders presents a difficult management problem to the vascular surgeon. When extensive distal disease is present bypass procedures with standard arterial reconstruction techniques may not be possible. The use of retrograde perfusion to deliver oxygenated blood to the capillary bed by means of a normal venous system is not new. Flow reversal has been attempted in the myocardial, cerebral, and distal extremity circulations. Arteriovenous reversal (AVR) has been described for limb salvage in patients with upper extremity ischemia, with variable results.\nWe performed six AVR procedures on five patients with diffuse distal arterial disease and limb-threatening upper extremity ischemia. Two patients had insulin-dependent diabetes, one had systemic lupus erythematosus (two extremities), one had rheumatoid arthritis with vasculitis, and the remaining patient had CRST (calcinosis, Raynaud's disease, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia) syndrome. The two patients with diabetes had systemic manifestations of atherosclerotic vascular disease and lower extremity ischemia; the remaining three patients had no evidence of atherosclerosis. In all patients the AVR was performed at the most distal site of nondiseased artery.\nLimb salvage was obtained in all cases; one patient had a healed minor digital amputation, and another patient had a healed major amputation. Clinical improvement with resolution of pain was achieved in five of six cases. The remaining patient had a significant diabetic neuropathy that was believed to contribute to her persistent pain.\nIn patients with severe upper extremity ischemia not amenable to standard revascularization techniques, AVR should be considered to provide limb salvage and maximize hand function.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of carotid endarterectomy in the prevention of strokes mandates low perioperative morbidity, as well as a low incidence of late ipsilateral stroke. This prospective study involving 430 patients (461 carotid endarterectomies) correlated the results of intraoperative assessment with end points of stroke and residual/recurrent internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis.\nAdequacy of the repair was assessed by ultrasound studies (duplex scan and pulsed Doppler spectral analysis) alone (n = 142), ultrasound studies and arteriography (n = 268), or clinical inspection (n = 51). After operation, duplex ultrasonography was used to confirm patency and categorize severity of ICA stenosis. At operation 26 carotid endarterectomy sites (5.6%), were revised based on intraoperative studies.\nPerioperative (30-day) morbidity rates were similar in patients with normal, mildly abnormal, or no ultrasound completion studies. There were six permanent (1.3%) and 12 temporary (2.6%) neurologic deficits and six deaths, including four fatal strokes and two fatal myocardial infarctions. By life-table analysis, the incidence of greater than 50% diameter-reducing ICA stenosis or occlusion was increased (p < 0.007, log-rank test) in patients with residual flow abnormality or no study. More important, patients with normal intraoperative flow studies had a significantly lower rate of late ipsilateral stroke compared with the remaining patient cohort (p = 0.04, log-rank test). During the mean 30-month follow-up interval, the incidence of late stroke was increased (p = 0.00016) in patients with ICA restenosis or occlusion (3/35) compared with patients without recurrent stenosis (3/426).\nConfirmation of a normal repair at operation affords the best opportunity to minimize ischemic neurologic events and anatomic restenosis after carotid endarterectomy.",

Complete angiographic data were available in 393 carotid arteries.\nSiphon stenosis was found ipsilateral to the CEA in 84 (21.4%) of the arteries. Most lesions were in the 20% to 49% diameter-reducing range (77.4%), with the remainder in the greater than 50% range (22.6%). There were no occlusions. The perioperative mortality rate was nearly identical for the groups with and without siphon stenosis, 0.0% versus 0.6%, respectively (p = 0.99). Perioperative stroke morbidity rates (no stenosis, 2.3%; moderate stenosis, 3.1%; > 50% stenosis, 5.3%) were acceptable and were not statistically different (p > 0.38). Late ipsilateral stroke-free rates were similar in the groups with and without siphon stenosis.

Long-term ipsilateral stroke-free rates were not significantly different in the subgroups with moderate (20% to 49%) and hemodynamically significant (> 50%) siphon stenosis. The 3- and 5-year ipsilateral stroke-free rates were 96.7% and 87.9% versus 94.6% and 94.6%, respectively (p = 0.69).

Heart disease was responsible for most late deaths, 47% in both groups. Late stroke-related deaths were infrequent: 1.3% in patients with and 0.0% in patients without siphon stenosis.\nAlthough carotid siphon stenosis seemed to be associated with a higher risk of late death, it did not alter the short- and long-term stroke morbidity rates after carotid endarterectomy significantly. We conclude that the presence of carotid siphon stenosis should not influence the decision to perform carotid endarterectomy in patients with the appropriate indications.",

Animals underwent inguinal exploration with no manipulation (group 1; n = 9), local lymphatic ligation (group 2; n = 11), or radical excision and ligation (group 3; n = 15) of the inguinal lymph vessels. Lymphatic flow was calculated by 99mTc-HSA clearance (counts per minute) at the popliteal, inguinal, and iliac regions, before and after lymph vessel manipulation and was converted into percent change between the regions.\nThere was statistically reduced intralymphatic radioactivity in groups 2 and 3 compared with group 1 (p < 0.001; Student t test), whereas there was no significant difference between groups 2 and 3.\nThis demonstrates that lymphatic flow in this experimental model is significantly reduced when major channels are identified and ligated, although radical obliteration does not reduce flow more significantly than local ligation, implying that there is an alternate pathway for lymph flow.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to clarify the role of intraarterial thrombolytic therapy (IATT) in the management of acute lower extremity ischemia.\nA retrospective review of 77 patients undergoing 84 courses of high-dose regional urokinase IATT from July 1981 to June 1991 was performed. The group included patients with acute thrombosis of lower extremity bypass grafts (n = 48) or native arteries (n = 36), presenting with ischemic but viable limbs, minimal or no motor dysfunction, and an absence of muscle rigor or compartment syndrome. The data were then examined individually by site of thrombosis to evaluate patient selection for IATT.\nComplete lysis, complications (either distal thromboembolism or bleeding), and early limb loss occurred in 59.5%, 11%, and 6% of infusions, respectively. IATT precluded the need for operative intervention in 49% of acutely ischemic limbs. When surgery was required, successful IATT precisely localized responsible lesions and reduced the magnitude of operation. A subset of 13 patients were identified in whom either no intrinsic abnormality or poor runoff were evident after lysis and were treated with anticoagulation alone.\nThese data show IATT to be especially suitable for thrombosis of native iliac or femoropopliteal arteries and infrainguinal vein grafts. IATT serves primarily as an adjunct in management of acute lower extremity ischemia. After successful IATT, subsequent therapy can be tailored to the anatomic cause of thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of three drugs (cilazapril, cyclosporine, and aspirin) in modulating the progression of intimal hyperplasia during short postoperative times in short-segment, autogenous vein bypass grafts in a canine model. The relative effects of the drugs on the progression of intimal hyperplasia were compared with the Gilman parameter, a measure used extensively as a wound healing descriptor. To our knowledge this is the first use of the Gilman parameter in assessing vascular disease.\nSeventy-two conditioned mongrel dogs were randomly and equally divided according to a three-factor analysis of variance. The factors included (1) drug treatments (cilazapril [10 mg/kg/day], cyclosporine [4 mg/kg/day], aspirin [325 mg/day], and control [nonmedicated]), (2) implantation sites (femoral and carotid arteries), and (3) postoperative times of graft harvest (1, 3, and 6 weeks). Each dog had 2 cm segments of autogenous jugular vein interpositioned bilaterally into each of the paired carotid and femoral arteries. Quantitative data on luminal narrowing over time from intimal hyperplasia were compared from calculated Gilman parameters after image analysis of retrieved, histologically processed graft sections.\nThe observed variability in the data was attributed to drug treatments and time. At 1 week after operation the mean Gilman parameters did not differ significantly among the treatment groups in either midgraft or distal graft segments. At 3 weeks the mean Gilman parameters of midgraft and distal graft sections of cyclosporine-treated dogs differed significantly (p < 0.05) from those of the control group and the cilazapril and aspirin-treated groups, which did not differ from each other. At 6 weeks after operation, mean Gilman parameters from aspirin- and cyclosporine-treated dogs differed statistically from control and cilazapril-medicated dogs and from each other (p < 0.001).\nThese data support the efficacy of aspirin and cyclosporine in reducing intimal hyperplasia in short-segment arterialized vein grafts during short postoperative periods. Additional studies are required to ascertain whether the beneficial effects of aspirin and cyclosporine persist long-term.",

    "abstract": "A 7-year experience in which 43 patients underwent supraceliac aortic cross-clamping (SC-AXC) during elective abdominal aortic reconstruction was reviewed.\nOperation was performed for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 29 (68%) patients, aortoiliac occlusive disease in seven (16%), proximal anastomotic AAA in three (7%), \"shaggy\" aorta syndrome in three (7%), and in situ grafting of a previously ligated aorta in one (2%) patient. The indications for supraceliac control included pararenal AAA origin (25), pararenal aortic atherosclerosis (18), inflammatory AAA (2), and a short infrarenal aortic stump (1). Vital organ ischemic complications (VOICs) were defined as any major ischemic complication involving the liver, kidneys, bowel, or spinal cord.\nThe incidence of VOICs was significantly increased when concomitant renal or visceral revascularization (CRVR) was required (p = 0.002) and correlated with an increasing SC-AXC time (p = 0.015). In patients undergoing CRVR (n = 16) the perioperative mortality rate was 25%; VOICs developed in six patients and included renal failure (3), mesenteric/colonic ischemia (3), hepatic ischemia with coagulopathy (2), and spinal cord ischemia (1). In contrast, in those not requiring CRVR (n = 27), SC-AXC was well tolerated. There were no VOICs and no deaths; morbidity rate was 33%.\nThe incidence of VOICs associated with the use of SC-AXC is primarily related to the level of preoperative renal or mesenteric insufficiency, the severity of pararenal aortic atherosclerosis, the extent of the operative procedure, and the duration of proximal aortic cross-clamping. In complex abdominal aortic reconstruction in which infrarenal aortic control is either not possible or deemed hazardous, SC-AXC is a safe and valuable technique for achieving proximal control.",

The grafts and adjacent arteries were removed 4 or 20 weeks after implantation for measurement of platelet-derived growth factor production in organ culture, endothelial cell coverage, and intimal thickness.\nMidgraft platelet-derived growth factor production by seeded graft segments increased from 41 +/- 6 to 148 +/- 27 pg/cm2/72 hr (p < 0.002) between 4 and 20 weeks.

    "abstract": "Technical problems with renal revascularization can be difficult to detect, especially with end points of transaortic renal endarterectomies or anastomosis of bypass grafts to small distal renal arteries. If missed, such technical mishaps may not be recognized until after operation, when the chance for timely renal salvage has often been lost.\nTo evaluate the value of newer color-flow duplex imaging, we performed intraoperative ultrasonography on 35 patients undergoing revascularization of 64 renal arteries, 29 patients undergoing transaortic endarterectomy, and 6 undergoing bypass grafting. Most patients (24/35; 69%) underwent concomitant aortic reconstruction. Ninety-four percent had hypertension, whereas 66% had associated chronic renal insufficiency.\nTechnical abnormalities prompting operative revision were identified during surgery in 10.9% of reconstructed main renal arteries (7/64). These included two occlusions, three intimal defects, and one extrinsic tissue band after endarterectomy plus one graft anastomotic stenosis. Color-flow imaging revealed all of them. Technical defects were also associated with higher peak-systolic flow velocities (mean 2.62 m/sec; range 2.00 to 3.50 m/sec) than normal-appearing arteries (mean 1.34 m/sec; range 0.40 to 2.50 m/sec) (p = 0.004). Eighty-six percent of the defects (6/7) were immediately correctable. One patient required nephrectomy. Postoperative angiograms revealed two asymptomatic small branch-vessel occlusions (3%). Compared with preoperative levels (p < 0.01), both hypertension and renal insufficiency improved initially. The clinical outcome of patients requiring intraoperative revision did not differ from that of patients undergoing normal intraoperative studies.\nIntraoperative color-flow duplex detection and surgical correction of technical problems with renal revascularization have enhanced our technical success and been associated with long-term results comparable to those of patients undergoing normal intraoperative studies.",

Nifedipine increased monocyte uptake of LDL (10 micrograms/ml; p < 0.003 but reduced monocyte movement through the EC barrier (p < 10(-7).

    "abstract": "Advances in cerebral vascular imaging suggest that patients with critical levels of carotid artery stenosis (> 70%) who have symptoms can be identified accurately and necessary information about the intracranial and extracranial circulation obtained before surgery without conventional angiography. We have used carotid duplex imaging in combination with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to evaluate 20 patients with symptomatic ipsilateral high-grade carotid stenosis.\nAll patients underwent CT and magnetic resonance imaging brain scans, as well as MRA and conventional arteriography of the cerebral circulation. Magnetic resonance angiograms were obtained with two-dimensional phase contrast and time-of-flight techniques. Phase contrast was used for intracranial vascular imaging and for determining qualitative flow velocities and the direction of blood flow in the circle of Willis. Two-dimensional time of flight was used to assess the carotid bifurcations.\nTwenty patients with symptoms (six with strokes, 11 with transient ischemic attacks, and three with amaurosis fugax) had duplex evidence of high-grade carotid stenoses. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance brain scans were positive for cerebral infarction in six patients with clinical strokes. Comparison of MRA with conventional angiography was 91% accurate for high-grade stenoses and occlusions (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90% for stenosis; sensitivity/specificity was 100% for complete occlusion). Comparison of duplex imaging with conventional angiography demonstrated 86% accuracy for detection of severe stenosis or occlusion (sensitivity 94% and specificity 89% for stenosis; sensitivity and specificity were 100% for complete occlusion).\nThis study suggests that combined use of MRA and duplex imaging is accurate for detection and evaluation of high-grade carotid stenoses in patients with symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Although routine noninvasive surveillance is recommended after carotid endarterectomy (CEA), there are little data to show that identification and eradication of recurrent carotid artery stenosis are necessary to avoid the risk of subsequent neurologic complications.\nWe reviewed our experience over a 16-year period in 380 consecutive patients undergoing 409 CEAs who underwent serial postoperative ultrasonic scanning at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after CEA and then yearly thereafter.\nRecurrent stenoses (> or = 50% diameter reduction) were detected in 44 arteries (10.8%) during follow-up from 1 to 177 months (mean 42.0 months). Most (70.5%) occurred within 2 years of CEA. Cumulative recurrence rates were 5.8%, 9.9%, 13.9%, and 23.4% at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Recurrent stenoses were more frequent in female (p = 0.02) and younger patients (p = 0.01) and less frequent in those having a vein patch repair (p = 0.02). Most recurrences (84%) were in the 50% to 79% stenosis range. In four patients 80% to 99% stenoses developed and in three patients total occlusions developed, for a severe recurrence rate of 2.1%. Only 10 (22.7%) of the recurrent stenoses were initially symptomatic, and only one (2.9%) of the asymptomatic restenoses later became symptomatic. One patient with recurrent stenosis suffered a stroke (0.3%). Cumulative 5-year ipsilateral stroke-free rates in patients with recurrent stenosis (94.4%) were practically identical (p = 0.76) to those in patients without recurrent stenosis (94.2%). Life-table ipsilateral stroke-free survival rates at 5 years were 94.2% in patients with recurrent stenosis and 78.4% in patients without recurrent stenosis (p = 0.16). Four (9%) recurrent stenoses and 12 lesions (27%) in the contralateral artery progressed. Only seven patients (1.7%) underwent repeat operation for ipsilateral disease, four for symptoms and three for recurrent stenosis.\nRecurrent carotid artery stenosis occurs early after CEA, is typically benign, and remains stable over a prolonged follow-up period. Our results question the importance of routine noninvasive surveillance after CEA and suggest that a more conservative approach would be equally beneficial in terms of clinical relevance and cost-effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Our purpose was to determine the incidence and segmental distribution of intraluminal disease in the arm veins of patients in whom saphenous vein was unavailable or inadequate for bypass, determine whether angioscopic evaluation and directed interventions can upgrade the quality of arm vein conduit and improve early graft patency, and describe the angioscopic technique of in situ retrograde arm vein inspection.\nRetrospective review of 109 infrainguinal arm vein bypass grafts in 104 patients performed with intraoperative angioscopic vein preparation and monitoring between August 1989 and March 1992 was undertaken. Four additional arm veins harvested were discarded because of diffuse disease.\nIntraluminal disease was noted in 71 (62.8%) of 113 arm veins, \"webs\" in 61 (54%), vein sclerosis in 25 (22.1%), localized stenosis in 11 (9.7%), and thrombus in 7 (6.2%). Intraluminal disease was most common in the cephalic (forearm 49.2%; arm 35.1%) and median cubital (33.3%) veins and least common in the basilic vein (11.7%). Eighty-three angioscopically directed interventions in 68 of 71 abnormal arm veins resulted in upgraded vein conduit quality in 47 (66.1%) of 71. Primary patency (< 30 days) was 99 (90.8%) of the 109 grafts, 85 (95.5%) of 89 grafts with normal or upgraded quality conduits, and 14 (70%) of 20 inferior-quality grafts (p = 0.0024). These differences persisted through 1 year by life-table analysis, (p < 0.001).\nNot only is the routine use of the angioscope in arm vein bypass grafting a sensitive technique to detect the intraluminal diseases so prevalent in arm veins but it can also direct endoluminal and surgical interventions that upgrade the quality of the vein conduit and improve early graft patency.",

Although postoperative cord ischemia is often unpredictable, certain patient subgroups may be at greater risk and identified as such before surgery. The case of a 64-year-old man who became paraplegic after an infrarenal aortoiliac aneurysm repair is reported. He had lost his mesenteric arcade as a result of a prior colectomy. Aortoiliac reconstruction required the interruption of antegrade hypogastric blood flow. Restoring circulation to at least one hypogastric artery is a tenet of modern aortic surgery. However, the loss of both internal iliac arteries and the occlusion of the inferior mesenteric artery at its origin are occasionally well tolerated because of a mesenteric collateral pathway. Colectomy eliminates the mesenteric arcade and further increases the risk of spinal ischemia when attempts at pelvic revascularization have failed.",

    "abstract": "A decade ago vascular surgery \"came of age\" with formalization of accreditation of training programs and certification of subspecialists in the field. These events created turbulence in general surgery, with initial resistance to further subspecialization and fragmentation of the specialty. Subsequent reassessment of the trends in general surgery and its subspecialty disciplines has led to a reaffirmation of the integrity of the parent specialty. Recent proposals for reforms in resident training in general surgery and its subspecialties are currently being evaluated. Despite the current rapprochement between general and vascular surgery, many challenges remain for both disciplines. All surgeons, regardless of specialty, should broaden their respect for both \"microscience,\" particularly molecular biology, and \"macromedicine,\" including epidemiology, preventive medicine, and health services research.",

    "abstract": "Risk factors for postoperative wound infection in patients undergoing vascular surgery may include age, comorbid conditions, wound classification, use of prosthetic grafts, and repeat operations. Groin incisions, in particular, pose substantial risk during placement of prosthetic grafts.\nTo investigate the role of infected inguinal lymph nodes (LN) in groin wound infection (GWI), we excised an inguinal LN from 69 consecutive patients (89 groins) undergoing 36 infrainguinal reconstructions, 24 aortobifemoral bypasses, 12 extra-anatomic femoral bypasses, 11 vein stripping, and 6 femoral pseudoaneurysm repairs. LN Gram staining was performed, and aerobic and anaerobic cultures were obtained. In addition cultures were taken from any ulcerated or gangrenous lesion on the ipsilateral open extremity lesion.\nBacteria were isolated from 10 of 89 LN (11.2%) and included Staphylococcus species, gram-negative rods, diphtheroids, and Peptostreptococcus. Three of the 10 LN were taken from extremities with open lesions; seven were not. In no case did organisms cultured from a groin LN correlate with its corresponding open extremity lesion. Four GWI developed after operation (4%). In each case results of the groin LN cultures were negative. Three of the GWI were associated with an ulcerated or gangrenous lesion on the ipsilateral extremity (p = 0.08, odds ratio = 7.6), but in only one case did the organisms from the GWI correspond to that in the open lesion. The development of a GWI was strongly associated with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (p = 0.009, odds ratio = 22.9).\nIn conclusion, 11% of groin LN harbored bacteria, but none of these were associated with subsequent development of a wound infection. Instead, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and the presence of an open skin lesion on the ipsilateral extremity seemed to be associated with an increased risk of wound infection.",

    "abstract": "Graft thrombectomy is often an effective method for restoring inflow in an occluded limb of an aortobifemoral graft. A major determinant for its success is the completeness of thrombus removal from the graft, verification of which can be performed by angioscopy.\nA retrospective review since January 1989 identified 51 unilateral graft limb thrombectomy operations in 35 patients. At the discretion of the surgeon 20 of these procedures included angioscopic inspection of the graft for significant retained thrombus, which was found and retrieved in 11 (55%).\nVisualization of the graft limb was very good, but inspection of the graft body was not possible. There were no angioscopy-related complications. Within the first 4 months after graft limb thrombectomy and reconstruction, four of 20 patients in the group inspected by angioscopy and nine of 31 in the conventionally treated group had reocclusion of the treated limb.\nThese results suggest that angioscopy can be a helpful adjunct in the successful inflow management of aortic graft limb thrombectomy to verify the completeness of clot removal.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cell (SMC) growth kinetics are often studied in culture without consideration of endothelial cell (EC) influences that occur in vivo. This study examined the time-dependent effect of EC on SMC in a new type of coculture system.\nBovine aortic EC and SMC were harvested from fresh specimens, grown to four passages from primary cultures, and plated on either side of a porous 13 microns thick polyethylene terephthalate membrane. SMC were studied in coculture opposite from confluent EC (EC/SMC). Controls included SMC cultured opposite SMC (SMC/SMC) or SMC alone (with no cells on the opposite side of the membrane, phi/SMC). After cocultures were established, SMC were harvested from 1 to 4 days after release from growth arrest (n = 5 cultures/day/group). SMC DNA and protein content and 3H-thymidine incorporation were measured in each group. SMC proliferation was indexed by 3H-thymidine incorporation per cellular DNA content.\nEC stimulated SMC proliferation 56% more than SMC/SMC cultures and 244% more than SMC alone on day 1 after growth arrest (p < 0.05). This effect decreased with time so that by day 4, EC seemed to inhibit SMC proliferation (49% less proliferation than SMC/SMC and 76% less than SMC alone, p < 0.05). SMC opposite EC had significantly less protein/DNA than control SMC, and they retained a thin, spindle shape compared with the hypertrophic appearance of SMC in the absence of EC. Electron microscopy revealed EC gap junctions and cytoplasmic projections from SMC of sufficient length to transverse the pores in the coculture membrane.\nThis coculture method has several useful features, including an appropriate luminal/abluminal EC/SMC orientation, a short distance between the cell layers, the potential for cell-to-cell contact, and the ability to separate the cell types for assays. It is clear that EC markedly affect SMC proliferation, protein/DNA ratio, and structure in coculture with dynamic interactions occurring for at least 4 days. These effects must be considered when attempting to model in vivo phenomena in tissue culture.",

    "abstract": "We report an initial experience with 24 patients studied between March 1990 and April 1992 with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for lower extremity occlusive disease.\nAll patients underwent vascular intervention with either balloon angioplasty or bypass grafting, and in six patients this intervention was based on MRA findings alone. Eighteen patients were studied with both MRA and contrast arteriography, and there was observed agreement between the two studies in 98% of all arterial segments examined.\nAgreement between MRA and contrast arteriography was uniform for arterial segments below the inguinal ligament. Intraoperative findings and favorable early results of seven bypass grafts performed in six patients after MRA alone suggested this was a valid approach for patients at prohibitive risk of complications from contrast arteriography.\nMagnetic resonance angiography is accurate in demonstrating relevant anatomy in peripheral arterial occlusive disease and in selected patients may eliminate the need for contrast arteriography before lower extremity revascularization.",

The results were compared with those of 14 patients (group II) in whom the technique was similar except that venous tributaries were identified angioscopically and then ligated and 24 patients (group III) who underwent standard \"open\" ISVB through one long incision without angioscopy or vein mapping and in whom valvulotomy was carried out with a rigid valvulotome passed through tributaries.\nIn comparing the results of groups I and III, significant reductions in operative intravenous fluid requirements (1930 ml vs 2675 ml; p = 0.04), postoperative length of stay (4.4 days vs 9.1 days; p < 0.001), and wound complications (1 vs 9; p = 0.01) were observed.

    "abstract": "Autogenous vein grafts to infrapopliteal arteries performed for chronic limb-threatening ischemia between 1984 and 1991 were reviewed to determine whether bypasses to pedal arteries produce results comparable to those obtained after supramalleolar tibial or peroneal bypasses.\nPedal bypass (dorsal pedal, n = 41; below-ankle posterior tibial, n = 12) was performed only if a suitable tibial target artery was not available. These grafts were compared with tibial (including peroneal) bypass grafts (n = 203). All grafts were placed for rest pain (23%) or established tissue loss (77%).\nPatients requiring pedal bypass were more likely to have diabetes and congestive heart failure but less likely to have a history of smoking. Age, gender, previous myocardial infarction, and other comorbidities were similar in the two groups. Operative mortality rates (30 days) were higher for pedal than tibial bypasses (9% vs 2%; p = 0.021), possibly reflecting the higher prevalence of diabetes, congestive heart failure, and more advanced systemic atherosclerosis associated with severe tibial artery disease. Most grafts were in situ saphenous vein (70% pedal vs 79% tibial). Life-table 3-year primary graft patency (58% pedal vs 61% tibial), secondary patency (82% pedal vs 79% tibial), limb salvage (92% pedal vs 87% tibial), and patient survival (61% pedal vs 64% tibial) were comparable in the two groups. Improved assisted primary patency and secondary patency rates in both groups were primarily a result of revision of graft-threatening lesions detected with noninvasive graft surveillance before thrombosis. Mean postoperative ankle/brachial index was similar for pedal and tibial bypasses, whereas mean duplex-estimated graft flow was less for pedal grafts (88 +/- 10 ml/min vs 129 +/- 6 ml/min; p = 0.002). Pedal bypass represented 21% of our experience with infrapopliteal vein grafts for chronic limb-threatening ischemia and was required more frequently in diabetic patients. Operative mortality rates were higher in patients undergoing pedal bypass, suggesting that aggressive preoperative diagnostic studies and perioperative monitoring may be appropriate for this group. Long-term survival was similar.\nWe conclude that autogenous vein pedal bypass grafts provide hemodynamic results and limb salvage rates comparable to more proximal tibial bypasses in properly selected patients.",

    "abstract": "Occlusion of the common carotid artery (CCA) is generally associated with occlusion of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA). Occasionally, however, collateral circulation to the ECA may preserve patency of the ICA via retrograde perfusion through the bulb. These patients may suffer ongoing transient ischemic attacks and risk for stroke. Recognition of this pathologic variant may allow for effective surgical intervention.\nWe have performed seven operations in six patients with occluded CCAs and patent ECA and ICAs. The occluded CCA was on the left side in each case (p < 0.01). Six of the operations were performed for ischemic symptoms, including amaurosis fugax in five patients, hemispheric TIA in one patient, and profound global ischemia in two patients who had concomitant occlusions of other extracranial vessels. In the five most recent cases the patent ECA and ICA above the occluded CCA were recognized by preoperative duplex scanning, which prompted cerebral angiography. A variety of reconstructive procedures were used, depending on the pathologic anatomy. These procedures included subclavian or axillary artery to carotid artery bypass with carotid endarterectomy (five), carotid endarterectomy with thrombectomy of the proximal CCA (one), and ascending aorta to carotid artery bypass (one).\nThere were no strokes associated with the surgery, although one patient had transient neurologic symptoms and a seizure associated with documented reperfusion edema. Three of the patients had preoperative and postoperative transcranial Doppler studies that documented significant improvement in intracranial hemodynamics. Five of the patients have had continuously patent grafts with relief of symptoms for an average of 40 months (range 3 to 155 months). The remaining patient had graft occlusion after 72 months and underwent repeat operation for amaurosis fugax and global ischemia. His second graft remains patent, and he is symptom free 21 months later.\nRecognition of patent distal vessels above a CCA occlusion depends on a high index of suspicion, careful investigation of the carotid bulb with duplex scanning, and delayed arteriographic views of the bulb allowing for late collateral vessel filling. The favorable results in this small series of patients supports an aggressive surgical approach when patients with symptoms are encountered with patent distal vessels above an occluded CCA.",

In time course studies the growth of SMC treated with 100 ng/ml 8-MOP and 2 joule/cm2 UVA were monitored over 5 days, and this regimen was found to be cytostatic.

    "abstract": "The widely accepted durability of autogenous vein for infrainguinal arterial bypass has led the authors to use the superficial femoral and popliteal vein in selected cases. The results of this experience are presented.\nFrom January through December 1991, during which 92 lower extremity bypass procedures were performed, deep vein bypass was attempted in seven patients (three femoral-popliteal grafts, two femoral-peroneal grafts, one femoral-deep femoral bypass, and one popliteal-posterior tibial bypass). In all cases the saphenous vein was absent or inadequate for use as a bypass conduit. The superficial femoral vein was harvested to below the knee in five patients.\nAt last follow-up six of seven patients had patent grafts with relief of their original symptoms. All the procedures were complicated by venous stasis; acute postoperative phlegmasia developed in two cases. In one of these cases the limb was salvaged by below-knee fasciotomy and deep venous bypass (distal popliteal vein to common femoral vein with polytetrafluoroethylene). In the other case an above-knee amputation was required. Of the five remaining patients three had moderate venous stasis edema unresponsive to limb elevation and compression stockings after operation, and two have had resolution of minimal postoperative venous stasis with simple limb elevation. All cases of severe and moderate venous stasis occurred in patients with popliteal vein harvest to below the knee.\nThe authors conclude that the use of the deep veins of the lower extremity for bypass is effective but is associated with a significant increase incidence of venous stasis edema. Two instances of phlegmasia were associated with popliteal vein harvest below the knee, and the authors caution against harvest of the popliteal vein to this level.",

    "abstract": "When failure of vein grafts is due to technical error it is usually observed in the early postoperative period. In this review we describe late failure of five bypass grafts as a result of entrapment of the vein graft caused by an improperly placed tunnel from the femoral to the popliteal artery. Vein graft entrapment may either produce no symptoms or eventually lead to limb ischemia. Pulses and pressures that vary with flexion and extension maneuvers should alert the clinician to the possibility of an entrapment syndrome. The characteristic arteriographic findings observed in these patients include an aberrant course of the vein graft outside the anatomic course of the popliteal artery and position-dependent compression of the graft. The ability of magnetic resonance angiography to demonstrate the arteriographic appearance of the graft as well as the precise location of the compression and to identify structures involved in the entrapment, make it a valuable noninvasive tool in the preoperative assessment of these patients. Treatment options include division of the gastrocnemius muscle, division of the vein graft, or replacement of the vein graft. Familiarity with vein graft entrapment should facilitate its recognition. Careful placement of bypass grafts along the anatomic course of the popliteal artery within the popliteal space will prevent this complication.",

The study was retrospective and covered a demographically defined population of 230,000 inhabitants in the city of Malm\u00f6, Sweden. Reports of all identified ruptured AAAs in Malm\u00f6 from 1971 to 1986 were analyzed. The autopsy rate in the city was 85% during this period.\nRuptured AAAs were found in 5.6 of 100,000 persons (8.4/100,000 men and 3.0/100,000 women). No increase was found during the study period after age and sex standardization. The age-specific incidence was highest (113/100,000) in men 81 to 90 years old and (68/100,000) in women older than 90. The number of surgical interventions increased among men but not among women and the surgical mortality rate decreased from 86% to 43%. The overall mortality rate for ruptured AAA was 88%. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain and loss of consciousness.\nThe validity of the study was based on a high autopsy rate. The incidence of aneurysm rupture was not low compared with other Scandinavian studies, but was low in comparison with studies from the United Kingdom. No increase in standardized rupture incidence was found. To substantially decrease the total mortality caused by rupture, operation must be performed before rupture.",

    "abstract": "Animal models have been used to assess the function of vascular smooth muscle and endothelium of veins grafted into arterial circulation. The primary model consists of grafting the external jugular vein into the carotid artery of the rabbit. These studies suggest a selective increase in the responsiveness of the grafted veins to serotonin. However, in both human cardiac and peripheral vascular operations, the saphenous, not the jugular, is the vein most frequently used. Thus the propriety of the rabbit model is unknown.\nHuman saphenous veins and vein grafts were obtained from patients undergoing leg vein bypass graft revisions (n = 8). The reversed vein grafts were placed into arterial circulation for periods ranging from 4 to 26 months before removal (mean 16 months). All vessels were immediately cut into rings and suspended in organ chambers for recording isometric contractions to norepinephrine and serotonin.\nThe maximal contractions elicited by both norepinephrine and serotonin were reduced in human vein grafts in comparison to the results in human saphenous vein (maximal response to norepinephrine 1.42 +/- 0.34 gm [vein graft] vs 4.59 +/- 1.13 gm [saphenous vein], p = 0.031; maximal response to serotonin 2.68 +/- 0.58 gm [vein graft] vs 4.72 +/- 1.11 gm [saphenous vein], p = 0.042). Human vein grafts were less responsive to norepinephrine than was saphenous vein (negative log of concentration that caused 50% of the maximal response -5.91 +/- 0.10 and -6.84 +/- 0.22, respectively; p < 0.009). After precontraction with norepinephrine (to 30% of the maximal response), saphenous vein, but not vein grafts, demonstrated endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (maximum relaxation 27.4% +/- 6.8%; p = 0.001).\nHuman saphenous veins grafted into arterial circulation exhibit loss of endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine and diminished contractions to agonists (norepinephrine and serotonin). In contrast to rabbit data, serotonin elicits dose-dependent contractions in both human saphenous vein and human vein grafts. Since the vascular wall contractility varies widely across species, the relevance of rabbit vein graft data to human bypass grafts is uncertain.",

Each of these lysine-containing peptides plus arginine-containing control salmine native protamine (n-protamine, [+21] charge) was studied in five dogs who received heparin 150 IU/kg intravenously followed by 1.5 mg/kg (intravenously during a 10-second period) of the synthesized peptide or control n-protamine.\nAnticoagulation reversal as assessed by a number of coagulation tests was more effective with peptides of greater cationic charge. In this regard, activated clotting time reversal 3 minutes after peptide administration was 7%, [+8]; 54%, [+16]; 81%, [+18]; 92%, [+20]; 81%, [+21]; and greater than 100% [n-protamine]. Reversal of heparin anticoagulation at 3 and 30 minutes, respectively, correlated significantly (*p < or = 0.05, p < or = 0.01 [see corresponding symbols within abstract]) with total cationic charge as assessed by activated clotting time (r = 0.97, 0.99 ), prothrombin time (r = 0.98, 0.87*), activated partial thromboplastin time (r = 0.99, 0.78), thrombin clotting time (r = 0.84,* 0.85*), heparin anti-Xa activity (r = 0.87,* 0.85*), and heparin anti-IIa activity (r = 0.79 at 3 minutes, p = 0.06). Maximum declines in systemic mean arterial pressure (MAP) were greater with more positively charged peptides: -1 mm Hg, [+8]; -3 mm Hg, [+16]; -31 mm Hg; [+18]; -31 mm Hg, [+20]; -35 mm Hg, [+21]; and -34 mm Hg [n-protamine]. Maximum decreases in MAP, cardiac output, and systemic oxygen consumption were highly correlated (p < or = 0.05) with total cationic charge: MAP, r = 0.87; cardiac output, r = 0.87; and systemic oxygen consumption, r = 0.86. A total toxicity score, reflecting adverse hemodynamic effects, was greater with increasing charge: -1.9 +/- 1.1, [+8]; -2.7 +/- 0.8, [+16]; -6.6 +/- 3.3, [+18]; -6.1 +/- 3.5, [+20]; -6.9 +/- 3.8, [+21]; and -7.0 +/- 5.2 [n-protamine]. The correlation of mean peptide total toxicity score to total cationic charge was significant (r = 0.89, p < 0.05).\nThese data suggest for the first time that effective alternatives to salmine protamine for reversal of heparin anticoagulation can be synthesized.

Other autogenous methods included bypass with lesser saphenous (21), arm (20), and composite (30) veins, endarterectomy of the common femoral (18) and superficial femoral (40) arteries, and isolated profundaplasty (9).\nMajor operative morbidity occurred in 41 patients (7%), early graft failure in 47 (8%), and death in 12 (2%). At 5 years, the overall cumulative primary patency rate was 63% and the secondary patency rate was 72%. The 5-year secondary patency rate for the subgroup in which greater saphenous vein was used was 79% and for alternative autogenous methods the rate was 49% (p < 0.001). During the period of follow-up, major amputation was performed in 45 (7.9%) of the operated limbs.\nThis experience supports continued preferential use of autogenous methods for infrainguinal reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "To compare the additional capacity of intravascular ultrasonography versus angiography to assess morphologic features and lumen dimension, 37 patients undergoing vascular intervention of the common iliac or superficial femoral artery were studied. A total of 181 ultrasonic cross sections were analyzed (94 before and 87 after intervention).\nBefore intervention intravascular ultrasonography distinguished normal cross sections (n = 17) from cross sections with a lesion (n = 77): soft (51%) versus hard (31%) lesions, and eccentric (75%) versus concentric (7%) lesions. After intervention intravascular ultrasonography documented dissection (43%), plaque rupture (10%), and internal elastic lamina rupture (8%). A good correlation between ultrasonography and angiography was found for the recognition of eccentric or concentric lesions and dissections. The degree of stenosis was assessed semiquantitatively by visual estimation of the degree of luminal narrowing from the angiograms and intravascular ultrasonic images and was categorized into four classes: (1) normal, (2) less than 50% stenosis, (3) 50% to 90% stenosis, and (4) greater than 90% stenosis. Intravascular ultrasonographic assessment of stenosis was in agreement with angiography in 78% of cases and showed more severe lesions in 22% before intervention. Similar data were observed after intervention, with 72% of results being in agreement and 28% of cases showing more severe lesions. The degree of stenosis was also quantitatively evaluated by computer-aided analysis of the intravascular ultrasonic images. The semiquantitative analysis by intravascular ultrasonography corresponded well with the quantitative analysis done by the computer-aided system. When both echography and angiography suggested that arteries were normal, quantitative intravascular ultrasonography identified lesions that occupied an average of 18% of the cross-sectional area of the vessel.\nThis in vivo study shows that intravascular ultrasonography is capable of documenting detailed morphologic features. Semiquantitative ultrasonic data correlate closely with those of angiography, albeit stenoses were assessed as more severe on ultrasonography.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative evaluation of renal artery bypass grafts historically has been obtained by contrast renal arteriography before discharge from the hospital. Recent reports have advocated replacing arteriography with abdominal duplex scanning for evaluating and monitoring the integrity of renal artery bypasses. We propose a combination of these two techniques, which provides minimal risk to the patient and renal parenchymal function.\nBetween July 1, 1990, and Dec. 31, 1991, 17 patients (8 men, 9 women) underwent 24 renal artery bypasses for poorly controlled hypertension or deteriorating renal function. In the immediate postoperative period each patient underwent carbon dioxide (CO2) renal arteriography to detect any technical defects and to define bypass graft anatomy. Subsequently, color-flow duplex scanning of the renal artery bypass grafts were done at 3-month intervals with the postoperative CO2 arteriogram for baseline comparison. CO2 arteriography clearly defined proximal/distal anastomotic anatomy, bypass conduit integrity, and bypass conduit runoff.\nProcedural morbidity was zero because no hematomas developed and serum creatinine remained stable. Duplex scanning for a mean follow-up of 8.3 months revealed antegrade flow in 23 bypasses with peak systolic velocity of 60 to 100 cm/sec. One bypass graft had a peak systolic velocity greater than 150 cm/sec suggestive of a proximal anastomotic stenosis; however, the patient died before a repeat, verifying CO2 arteriogram could be obtained. Recurrent hypertension developed in one patient with velocities less than 100/cm/sec, and repeat CO2 arteriography revealed no evidence of graft or anastomotic stenosis.\nCO2 arteriography and duplex scanning provide an accurate means of initially evaluating and subsequently monitoring renal artery bypass grafts, with minimal risk of renal or patient morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Intraoperative autotransfusion is frequently used in aortic surgery, despite the paucity of data regarding its safety and efficacy. This study was designed to compare whole blood autotransfusion with homologous transfusion for the replacement of blood lost during abdominal aortic procedures.\nWhole blood autotransfusion was evaluated in 200 patients undergoing aortic reconstructive procedures during a 3-year period. Collection and reinfusion of unwashed filtered shed blood was undertaken in 100 patients, and clinical, laboratory, and economic parameters were compared with those in a group of 100 patients undergoing aortic operation with homologous banked blood replacement.\nThe two groups were comparable with respect to demography, the type of procedure, baseline laboratory profile, and the frequency of coexistent medical illnesses. The amount of blood salvaged and reinfused averaged 1729 +/- 68 ml in the autotransfusion group. Patients undergoing autotransfusion received a mean of 0.6 +/- 0.1 units of banked blood during operation, compared with 3.4 +/- 0.1 units in the homologous group (p < 0.001). Operative morbidity and mortality rates were comparable between the groups, as were length of hospital stay and total hospital costs. Coagulopathy, renal insufficiency, abnormalities of oxygen exchange, and electrolyte disorders were infrequent. Autotransfusion offered significant advantages over homologous blood replacement with respect to improved preservation of circulating platelets (201 +/- 9 vs 157 +/- 6 x 10(3)mm3, p < 0.001) and coagulation factors (242 +/- 11 vs 196 +/- 14 mg fibrinogen/dl, p < 0.01) and limitation of exposure to homologous blood (34% vs 92%, p < 0.001). There was a significant cost advantage with the use of autotransfusion, with an average savings of $288 in hospital expenses associated with blood products and infusion equipment. Patients undergoing autotransfusion demonstrated aberrations in fibrin degradation products (33 +/- 4.4 vs 9.6 +/- 3.2 micrograms/ml, p < 0.001) and free plasma hemoglobin (29 +/- 9.1 vs 9.4 +/- 0.5 mg/dl, p < 0.05), but these laboratory abnormalities did not acquire clinical significance.\nThese data suggest that autotransfusion of unwashed, filtered blood is a safe and efficacious alternative to homologous blood replacement in patients undergoing major aortic reconstructive procedures.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic vascular grafts have never achieved long-term patency comparable to autologous saphenous vein. Changes in graft wall porosity and carbon coating of the luminal surface have both been suggested to improve patency.\nForty-two mongrel dogs, weighing 20 to 30 kg, underwent bilateral aortoiliac grafting with one of three randomly selected grafts: group I, 60 microns carbon-coated, thin-walled expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE); group II, 60 microns thin-walled uncoated ePTFE; or group III, regular ePTFE. All grafts were 10 cm long and had an internal diameter of 5 mm. Twenty-one dogs were killed at 60 days and 21 dogs were killed at 120 days. Thus in each group there were 14 60 microns, thin-walled, carbon-coated ePTFE grafts; 14 60 microns, thin-walled, uncoated ePTFE grafts; and 14 regular ePTFE grafts.\nAt 60 days, 12 (85.7%) of 14 group I, 13 (92.3%) of 14 group II, and 9 (64%) of 14 group III grafts were patent. At 120 days, 12 (85.7%) of 14 group I, 11 (78.6%) of 14 group II, and 6 (42.9%) of 14 group III grafts were patent. The patency of the 60 microns carbon-coated, thin-walled ePTFE at 120 days was significantly improved compared with that of the regular ePTFE (p < or = 0.05). The patency of the 60 microns thin-walled uncoated ePTFE was improved relative to conventional ePTFE at 120 days, although this difference was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference in patency between 60 microns carbon-coated, thin-walled ePTFE and 60 microns thin-walled uncoated ePTFE. When the results were analyzed simply on the basis of graft porosity, the 60 microns porosity grafts had a significantly improved patency compared to the regular ePTFE at 120 days (p < 0.05). Histologically, the 60 microns porosity grafts had significantly better tissue ingrowth along their entire length, regardless of the presence or absence of carbon coating. This ingrowth was present at both 60 days and 120 days.\nOur data suggest that increasing ePTFE graft porosity to 60 microns improves overall patency. However, the addition of carbon lining did not appear to further augment patency.",

    "abstract": "In patients with critical limb ischemia, poor distal arterial runoff, and absence of autogenous veins, the use of an artificial graft and an arteriovenous fistula might be a valuable option. However, in these patients little information is available regarding preoperative and postoperative microcirculatory hemodynamics after this type of intervention.\nWith the use of intravital capillary microscopy, we studied the effect of distal revascularization on the microcirculation in 26 patients with critical limb ischemia. All patients had had failed vascular reconstructive operations, and artificial grafts were required because of the absence of autogenous veins. Patients were prospectively investigated and divided into two groups: 12 patients received a femorocrural bypass with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, and 14 patients underwent the same procedure with the creation of an arteriovenous fistula at the site of the distal anastomosis and ligation of the proximal vein. Red blood cell velocity was measured before and after arterial occlusion to determine microcirculatory hemodynamic alterations.\nImmediate postoperative graft patency was achieved in all 26 patients. The 1-year cumulative graft patency rate was 64% in the group that had creation of an arteriovenous fistula, which was significantly higher (p < 0.01) compared with that in the group in which a fistula was not created (21%). The 1-year cumulative foot salvage rate was 72% in the patients with an arteriovenous fistula and 43% in the patients without a fistula (p < 0.05). Red blood cell velocity increased similarly in both groups after the bypass procedure. Peak and time to peak red blood cell velocity also improved significantly in both groups; however, comparing both groups, peak and time to peak red blood cell velocity were significantly better (p < 0.05) in the patients with an arteriovenous fistula and remained significantly higher during the follow-up period.\nIn conclusion, creation of an adjunctive arteriovenous fistula at the distal anastomosis of a prosthetic graft appears to improve microcirculatory hemodynamics in the nutritional capillary vascular bed. Improved graft patency and foot salvage rates suggest that this procedure benefits patients with critical limb ischemia who have no usable veins.",

The literature series of ALRVF, updated here to 19 reported cases, demonstrates that patients with ALRVF present with a unique clinical syndrome characterized by abdominal or left flank pain (84%), a pulsatile abdominal mass (63%), abdominal bruit or murmur (63%), hematuria (100%), and nonfunction of the left kidney on functional imaging studies (100% of patients studied). Operative findings in ALRVF syndrome have included a large AAA (mean diameter 9.2 cm), with frank rupture in only three; in 17 of 19 patients (89%) the ALRVF was associated with a retroaortic left renal vein anomaly. The patient presented here had a large juxtarenal AAA with rupture into the left retroperitoneal space. The wide aneurysm neck and expanding hematoma created an avulsion of the second left lumbar vein from its junction with an anatomically normal (preaortic) left renal vein; the resulting renal vein tear allowed development of an arteriovenous communication that was responsible for the clinical presentation of ALRVF syndrome. The disease found here demonstrates a novel mechanism for the production of ALRVF syndrome in patients with juxtarenal AAA and otherwise normal pararenal venous anatomy.",

    "abstract": "The optimal method of treatment of superficial femoral artery occlusive disease has yet to be established. Therapeutic options include percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for short lesions and reversed or in situ autologous saphenous vein bypass for long lesions. Currently, staged revascularization with polytetrafluoroethylene as an initial conduit and autologous vein for secondary procedures is suggested. An alternative to these procedures is endarterectomy of the occluded superficial femoral artery, followed by a femoropopliteal bypass in cases of endarterectomy failure. Our results with this procedure are reviewed in this article.\nFrom 1980 until 1990, 259 endarterectomies of the superficial femoral artery were attempted, 231 of which were successfully performed in 197 patients (145 men and 52 women), with an average age of 64 years (range 40 to 82 years). The indication for successfully performed endarterectomy was claudication in 186 patients (80%), rest pain in 21 (9%), and gangrene in 24 (11%). The postoperative mortality rate was 0.8% with a complication rate of 10%.\nEighty-two failures occurred during follow-up, of which 33 were treated with peripheral bypass. Five additional bypasses were performed because of occlusions distal from the endarterectomized segment. The 5-year primary overall patency rate of successfully performed endarterectomy was 71% (SE 3.6). The 5-year overall secondary bypass patency rate was 61% (SE 11.3). The combined endarterectomy and bypass patency rate (tertiary patency) was 79% (SE 3.3) after 5 years and 45% (SE 7.6) after 10 years. The overall amputation rate was 5.6% and the amputation rate was 1.6% in patients treated for claudication.\nThe combination of endarterectomy and peripheral bypass provides a valuable alternative to the current treatment of superficial femoral artery occlusive disease.",

Fibroblast expression of TIMP mRNA was normal under basal conditions. Sequence analysis of the cDNAs revealed an identical-point polymorphism in two of the six patients (a single base pair substitution of C-->T at the third position in codon 101), but the amino acid was conserved.\nThe studies reported here do not support the hypothesis that deficiency of TIMP-1 in specimens of aorta of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms results from a primary genetic defect.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to attempt to identify a group of patients undergoing infrarenal aortic bypass in whom blood loss is consistently less than 2 units, making the routine use of autotransfusion devices unnecessary.\nFour groups of patients were prospectively studied as follows: abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair with tube graft (n = 21), AAA repair with bifemoral or biiliac bypass (n = 19), and aortobifemoral bypass (AFB) or biiliac bypass for occlusive disease either with Cell Saver Autotransfusion Device (Haemonetics Corp., Braintree, Mass.) (n = 18) or without Cell Saver (n = 18). The latter two groups were randomized on an alternating basis.\nThe following parameters were obtained on all patients: preoperative hemoglobin values, estimated blood loss, Cell Saver return volumes, intraoperative and postoperative homologous blood transfused, postoperative hemoglobin values on the day of surgery and on postoperative days 1 and 4, complications, and length of hospital stay. In comparing the groups undergoing AFB with Cell Saver and AFB without Cell Saver by the above parameters, we found no statistically significant differences, except for a higher hemoglobin level on postoperative day 1 in the group undergoing AFB with Cell Saver (mean 11.86 vs 10.74, p = 0.02). The estimated blood loss and Cell Saver return volumes were less for those patients undergoing AFB for occlusive disease compared with those undergoing AFB for aneurysmal disease. Interestingly, estimated blood loss and Cell Saver return volumes for patients with AAA with tube graft and patients undergoing AFB with Cell Saver were similar.\nWe conclude that routine setup and use of rapid autotransfusion devices may not be necessary in every patient undergoing routine aortofemoral bypass for occlusive disease. Furthermore, the possibility that some patients may undergo AAA repair with tube grafts without use of the Cell Saver may be deserving of further investigation.",

    "abstract": "In patients with peripheral vascular disease the complications of associated coronary artery disease have always been a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Therefore we evaluated the risk for late cardiac morbidity and mortality in 376 consecutive patients after infrainguinal bypass. Follow-up was complete for 373 patients (99.3%) with a mean follow-up period of 5.9 years. After operation all but four patients were treated with lifelong warfarin (Coumadin therapy.)\nDuring follow-up 129 patients (34.3%) had 183 late cardiac events. Of these patients, 79 (61.2%) died of late cardiac events and 13 (10.0%) required either coronary angioplasty or bypass. The risk of late cardiac events was 34% at 5 years and increased to 56% at 15 years. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age, cardiac disease, and impaired renal function at the time of operation were associated with an increased risk of cardiac events during follow-up. Independent predictors of cardiac death were age, cardiac disease, hypertension, diabetes, and impaired renal function. Morbidity and mortality was particularly high in patients with critical ischemia. The subset of patients with claudication had a life expectancy that appeared to be similar to that of a matched sample of the normal population.\nOur findings clearly demonstrate that some patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass are at high risk for late cardiac events of which many are fatal, whereas others may have an almost normal life expectancy. Most important, the occurrence of cardiac events may be predicted by simple and readily obtainable clinical variables at the time of the initial infrainguinal bypass procedure. Because these events were related to late cardiac death, this may be the key for angiographic evaluation and possible prevention of cardiac death.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to describe the embryologic development and anomalous persistence of the sciatic artery, pathologic changes that may occur in the persistent sciatic artery, and management of complications related to these pathologic changes.\nTwo patients with persistence of the sciatic artery treated in the authors' experience are reported. In addition, the computerized data base of the University of Mississippi Medical Center was searched for patients with other lower extremity arterial aneurysms, and their records were reviewed for possible aneurysm of a persistent sciatic artery. A review of the literature was undertaken to determine the embryologic development of the persistent sciatic artery, the pathologic changes that have been observed in the sciatic artery, clinical findings associated with these pathologic changes, and methods of treatment.\nTwo patients with persistence of the sciatic artery were treated by the authors. No other cases were identified in 43 patients with 66 lower extremity aneurysms treated at our institution. The first patient presented with acute lower extremity ischemia caused by thrombosis of a sciatic artery aneurysm and was treated successfully with intraarterial thrombolytic therapy followed by interposition graft repair. In the second case an incidental unilateral persistent sciatic artery was identified in a patient with bilateral Buerger's disease presenting with digital gangrene of the contralateral extremity in whom below-knee amputation was eventually required. Bilateral tibial artery occlusion was observed on arteriography. Histologic examination of the amputated limb confirmed findings typical of Buerger's disease, and no microemboli were seen.\nThe sciatic artery is a continuation of the internal iliac artery and is the primary blood supply to the lower limb bud during early fetal development. The sciatic artery normally involutes during fetal development, but remnants persist as the popliteal and peroneal arteries after the superficial femoral artery develops and establishes continuity with the popliteal artery. Persistence of the sciatic artery as the major blood supply to the lower extremity in adults is a rare vascular anomaly that may be of surgical significance. Failure to appreciate the persistent sciatic artery as the major inflow into the lower extremity may lead to inappropriate bypass of apparent occlusive disease of the superficial femoral artery. The persistent sciatic artery is also frequently aneurysmal, which may cause critical limb ischemia resulting from thrombosis or embolization of aneurysm thrombus. Options for vascular reconstruction include interposition graft replacement and standard femoropopliteal bypass grafting if the common femoral artery is sufficiently developed to provide adequate inflow. As with other peripheral arterial aneurysms resulting in thrombosis and extensive distal arterial embolization and thrombosis, intraarterial thrombolytic therapy may be useful in selected cases before definitive surgical revascularization.",

    "abstract": "It is believed that secondary operations involving the inguinal region are associated with a significant morbidity that includes infection, lymphatic obstruction, lymphorrhea, and neurovascular injury. To prevent these potentially important complications we have avoided a redo groin incision in 38 patients with severely symptomatic disease who had primary (23 cases) or secondary (15 cases) femoropopliteal bypass thrombosis during the past 3 years.\nAll patients were candidates for prosthetic bypasses because of lack of a suitable vein. Twenty-nine external iliac-to-popliteal bypasses (18 above-knee; 11 below-knee) and nine external iliac-to-infrapopliteal bypasses (five anterior tibial; two posterior tibial; two peroneal) were performed with 6 mm polytetrafluoroethylene ringed grafts in 38 patients. Adjunctive distal arteriovenous fistulas were constructed in all infrapopliteal bypasses. The external iliac artery was exposed via a retroperitoneal approach. The second incision was placed just below the scarred area and deepened to the level of the medial border of the sartorius muscle. A tunnel that connected both incisions was easily created by blunt dissection alongside the anterolateral border of the femoral artery.\nFour popliteal bypasses occluded at 4, 6, 10, and 28 months after operation. The remaining 25 grafts are patent (mean 14 months). Three of the infrapopliteal bypasses occluded at 0, 2, and 3 months after operation. The remaining six grafts are patent with follow-up from 4 to 18 months (mean 12 months). Only one patient had a superficial wound infection at the below-knee popliteal incision, which healed with local treatment. All other patients had an uneventful postoperative course.\nThus we believe this approach to be simple, safe, and durable and should be used preferentially to avoid the difficult and hazardous dissection of a previously operated groin.",

Diabetes-induced arterial wall hypoxia is proposed as an initiator and continuing stimulus for atherosclerotic vascular occlusive disease.\nTransarterial wall oxygen gradient measurements were performed on the infrarenal aorta with an oxygen microelectrode 14 to 16 weeks after the induction of alloxan diabetes in rabbits.\nBoth insulin-treated and untreated alloxan diabetic rabbits revealed significantly decreased oxygen tensions throughout the arterial wall compared with control rabbits. There was no significant difference in the transarterial wall oxygen gradient between the two groups of diabetic rabbits. This effect was noted despite no difference in the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood or visual evidence of atherosclerotic lesion formation in the three groups.\nThese findings suggest that diabetes induces arterial wall hypoxia independent of insulin therapy and before the formation of atherosclerotic lesions.

    "abstract": "The occurrence of periodic blood flow variations (flow motion) in health and disease is controversially discussed. This is partly due to not reporting the incidence and to performing the analysis solely visually. We have therefore studied flow motion with computerized methods.\nWe used a computerized Prony spectral line estimator program to analyze the frequencies of resting skin blood flow variations, as determined by laser Doppler flowmetry on the thumb and great toe, in 50 male control subjects (group a), in 50 patients with mild peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD stages I and II; group b), and in 25 patients with severe PAOD (stages III and IV; group c).\nThe median ankle/arm pressure ratio was 1.10 in the control group, 0.72 in the mild PAOD group, and 0.66 in the severe PAOD group. Slow wave flow motion was detected in 19% of all thumbs from groups a and b (systolic arm pressures > 100 mm Hg) and in 12% of the toes in the control group. Patients with mild PAOD exhibited slow wave flow motion in 46% of the toes. Patients with severe PAOD showed slow waves in 77% of the toes. The median flow motion frequencies were about 1.6 cycles/min for groups a and b, when present. The median frequency in group c was significantly higher at 4.0 cycles/min, though still in the range of slow waves. The median peak-to-through amplitude was between 17% and 20% of mean flow for all groups.\nWe conclude that evaluation of flow motion requires computerized frequency analysis and that slow wave flow motion is a perfusion pattern characteristic of PAOD rather than of normal perfusion states. This finding has potential implications for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in arterial occlusive disease.",

    "abstract": "The presence of preexisting saphenous vein lesions adversely affects graft patency. Despite careful preoperative venous duplex examination and meticulous intraoperative evaluation, clinically significant saphenous vein disease may remain undetected. We evaluated angioscopy as a means to better detect these vein lesions.\nNinety saphenous vein remnants, obtained at bypass surgery, were perfusion fixed for subsequent angioscopic and histologic evaluation. The specimens were categorized by independent examiners on the basis of the angioscopic or light microscopic findings. Of the 90 vein remnants, 66 were normal by angioscopic criteria. Fifty-three (80%) of these angioscopically normal vein segments were normal histologically, and all 24 angioscopically abnormal saphenous vein remnants showed disease on microscopic examination.\nAngioscopy correctly identified sclerotic vein segments (n = 20) by irregular white plaques, whereas postphlebitic veins (n = 3) demonstrated multiple lumens, fibrous strands, and thickened opaque valve cusps on angioscopic evaluation. Absence of an angioscopic lumen was confirmed histologically in occluded veins (n = 2). Angioscopy failed to identify thick-walled (n = 10) and varicose (n = 2) vein segments as abnormal; one sclerotic segment was normal angioscopically, thereby lowering the sensitivity of angioscopy.\nAngioscopy detected unsuspected preexisting saphenous vein disease in five patients undergoing arterial reconstruction with saphenous vein. Because the use of angioscopy is a reliable means of prospectively assessing the vein for most preexisting lesions, its routine use may ultimately improve graft patency.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop an endovascular system for transfemoral placement of straight aortic grafts and bifurcated aortoiliac grafts.\nBoth types of graft consist of barbed, self-expanding stents attached to a woven polyester fabric. Survival studies of straight-graft function were performed in six large mongrel dogs. Digital subtraction fluoroscopic equipment was used to guide insertion and record angiograms at 0, 1, and 3 months. Bifurcated grafts were inserted in an additional eight dogs, four with distal stents and four without. Straight grafts were inserted into six cadaveric aortas (five atherosclerotic and one aneurysmal; age 68.7 + 5.7 years) to assess stent attachment.\nAngiograms obtained immediately after straight-graft insertion showed placement to be within 4.6 + 1.6 mm of the intended level. Follow-up angiograms at 1 and 3 months showed no migration, no leakage, and patency of all six grafts. After bifurcated graft insertion there were no angiographic signs of perigraft leakage, with or without distal stents. The mean force required to displace straight grafts 10 mm from their original position in cadaveric aortas was 1388 + 127 g.\nThese preliminary results show that straight and bifurcated endovascular grafts can be positioned accurately and securely in the abdominal aorta.",

    "abstract": "The physiologic significance of endothelin remains incompletely defined. Procoagulant and antifibrinolytic activities are increased in hypoxic cultured human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC). We examined the effect of hypoxia on HUVEC endothelin-1 production in vitro to determine whether a correlation existed between the procoagulant and antifibrinolytic response to hypoxia previously observed and an increase in vasoconstrictor peptide secretion by hypoxic HUVEC.\nCultured HUVEC were rendered hypoxic (PO2 = 40 mm Hg) or control (PO2 = 120 mm Hg) for 24 hours. Media were either standard, 5 gm glucose/L (high glucose), or contained 500 units superoxide dismutase/ml (SOD). Endothelin-like immunoreactivity for endothelin-1 (ET-IR) in conditioned media was measured by radioimmunoassay and expressed as mean femtomoles per milliliter (+/- SD) per 100,000 cells. Viability of HUVEC was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Significance was determined by use of Student's t test.\nConditioned media from hypoxic cells contained 76% more ET-IR than was found in control counterparts (p < 0.004). The addition of high glucose or SOD did not diminish ET-IR; a trend to higher ET-IR was present in both these groups versus standard media (303% and 226%, respectively, p < 0.03).\nThus 24 hours of hypoxia caused an increase in conditioned-media ET-IR in cultured HUVEC. Because SOD or greater substrate availability did not diminish endothelin presence in conditioned media, it seems that hypoxic induction of endothelin-1 production or secretion is signaled in a fashion unrelated to cell toxicity from the hypoxic period.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation is a central event in the development of arteriosclerotic plaque. Regulation of this proliferative process is controlled in part by the action of specific peptide growth factors that may influence early cell-cycle regulatory gene expression. Such \"early\" response genes include the protooncogene c-myc, which has been implicated in the induction of cell proliferation and differentiation. We compared the distribution of the c-myc protooncogene product in healthy and atherosclerotic human carotid arteries to determine its cellular and tissue localization.\nSamples of six carotid artery plaques from six patients were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of carotid endarterectomy. Three nondiseased human carotid arteries obtained at organ harvest from brain-dead organ donors were similarly prepared. Frozen sections were labeled with a polyclonal rabbit anti-c-myc antibody that recognizes the 64 kd c-myc human protein. The percentages of cells positive for c-myc (c-myc index) and the intensity of antibody labeling were determined.\nNormal human carotid artery demonstrated minimal, isolated cell staining, with single scattered grains of immunocytochemical staining product seen in SMC nuclei. The myc index was 14.7% +/- 3.5% positive cells. In comparison, SMCs from carotid plaque showed a significant predominance of c-myc immunoreactive cells (89.8% +/- 4%; p < 0.001). The intensity of c-myc staining was greater in plaque SMCs, with many of the cells demonstrating confluence of immunocytochemical precipitate throughout 50% of SMC nuclei.\nAlthough the exact role of enhanced expression of the c-myc protooncogene in atherosclerosis is unclear, a cooperative influence of abnormal early cell-cycle gene expression and humoral factors may initiate the atherogenic process. The c-myc gene and other protooncogenes are early molecular markers of cell-cycle activity, which may be important in the development of atherosclerosis and occlusive vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Cigarette smoking may exert its atherogenic effect by delaying the plasma clearance of dietary fat and cholesterol, allowing more time for their interaction with the artery wall. To study the effects of smoke on chylomicron metabolism in rats, we examined the metabolic effects of smoke on both whole animals and chylomicron particles in vitro.\nCarbon 14- and hydrogen 3-labeled chylomicrons were injected intravenously into smoke-treated rats and control rats that were not exposed to smoke (sham smoked). Plasma clearance, hepatic uptake, and heart binding were measured. In a second set of experiments, chylomicron particles were exposed to cigarette smoke in vitro by either: (1) passing smoke through chylomicrons suspended in saline solution (SCM) or (2) passing smoke through saline solution alone, then mixing the saline solution with chylomicrons (CM + SS). Normal (non-smoke exposed) rats were infused with either SCM, CM + SS, or control chylomicrons (CCM). Plasma clearance, hepatic uptake, and heart binding were again measured.\nThe initial plasma clearance time of labeled chylomicrons did not differ between smoke-treated and control animals. However, hepatic uptake of chylomicron cholesterol was slower in smoke-treated animals (46.1% +/- 0.9% of injected dose) than in controls (61.5% +/- 2.1%, p < 0.001). In contrast, more labeled chylomicrons remained in the heart of smoke-treated rats than controls (0.89% +/- 0.18% vs 0.45% +/- 0.05%, p < 0.05). Disappearance of 14C-labeled cholesterol from blood was delayed in rats injected with SCM (half-life = 9.0 +/- 0.4 minutes) and CM + SS (half-life = 8.0 +/- 0.4 minutes), compared with the time in rats injected with CCM (6.6 +/- 0.3 minutes, p < 0.05). Hepatic uptake of SCM (40.6% +/- 1.9% of injected dose) and CM + SS (45.0% +/- 1.9%) was less than that of CCM (60.7% +/- 4.4%, p < 0.05). In addition, the binding to the heart increased from 0.97% +/- 0.29% (CCM) to 2.45% +/- 0.30% with the infusion of SCM (p < 0.05). The binding in the heart of CM + SS (0.95% +/- 0.04%) was not different from that of CCM.\nThese data demonstrate for the first time that cigarette smoke exposure prolongs chylomicron residence time in tissues (heart) and delays hepatic uptake of chylomicron cholesterol in rats. The effect is present when either the animal or the chylomicron particle is exposed to smoke. We hypothesize that prolonged binding of relatively cholesterol-rich chylomicron remnants to endothelial surfaces could create a more atherogenic postprandial milieu.",

    "abstract": "Operations on the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta are associated with postoperative paraplegia rates as high as 20% to 30%. Attempts to reduce this complication have focused on decreasing the energy needs of the spinal cord with protective agents such as hypothermia and barbiturates or on increasing blood flow with various shunts. This study explores the hypothesis that perfusion of the spinal cord with hypothermic solutions or with adenosine will prevent or ameliorate paraplegia.\nNew Zealand white rabbits underwent 40 minutes of infrarenal aortic isolation. The infrarenal aorta is the primary source of spinal cord blood supply in the New Zealand white rabbit. Control rabbits sustained aortic occlusion without any protective measures. The remaining animals were randomized into three groups that underwent aortic cross-clamping with various protective adjuncts. Group I received regional aortic hypothermia perfusion, group II received systemic adenosine, and group III received regional aortic perfusion with high-dose adenosine.\nNeurologic function was graded according to the Tarlov scale (0 = no movement, 1 = slight movement, 2 = sits with assistance, 3 = sits alone, 4 = weak hop, 5 = normal hop). After 96 hours animals were euthanized, and spinal cords were harvested for histologic examination. The nonparaplegic animals in group I had a mean Tarlov score of 1.5, whereas those in group III had a mean score of 3.4. Histologic studies on spinal cord tissue revealed no significant differences between the study groups.\nThese data demonstrate that administration of regional adenosine attenuates ischemic injury associated with aortic occlusion in this experimental model.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective study was undertaken to investigate the effect of presenting neurologic symptoms, vascular risk factors, and degree of contralateral internal carotid artery stenosis on subsequent stroke and death rates of patients with internal carotid artery occlusion (ICO).\nOne hundred sixty-seven patients with ICO were evaluated over a 5-year period. Mean follow-up was 39 months. Initial symptoms included transient ischemic attack in 29 patients (17%), stroke in 71 patients (43%), nonhemispheric symptoms in 22 patients (13%), and no symptoms in 45 patients (27%). Ninety percent of the presenting strokes occurred ipsilateral to the ICO.\nDuring follow-up 54 (32%) patients died, 10 (19%) of stroke and 22 (41%) of heart disease. The 5-year cumulative survival rate was 63%. Subsequent neurologic events occurred in 26% of the patients. Thirty patients (18%) had a stroke during follow-up, of which 20 (67%) occurred ipsilateral to the ICO. The 5-year stroke-free rate was 76%. Patients who had a stroke had a less favorable 4-year stroke-free rate (67%) than those who had transient ischemic attack (92%) or those who originally had no symptoms (89%), p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively. In addition, there was a trend towards a worse 5-year contralateral stroke-free rate in patients with contralateral stenosis of 50% to 99% (77%) compared with patients with less than 50% contralateral stenosis (94%), p = 0.08. Twenty patients underwent carotid endarterectomy on the nonoccluded side. There were no perioperative strokes or deaths. Carotid endarterectomy seemed to reduce the long-term stroke morbidity rate (p = 0.10) on the operated side in patients with 80% to 99% contralateral stenosis but did not perceptibly improve stroke-free rates on the occluded side or in patients with 50% to 79% stenosis.\nPatients with ICO have a variable prognosis. There is a significant incidence of subsequent stroke, which seems to be related to the presenting neurologic event and the degree of stenosis in the contralateral internal carotid artery.",

All TP measurements were performed on at least two occasions 6 months apart. Primary end points included development of rest pain, tissue loss, or gangrene. The clinical course of 56 case controls with TP greater than 40 mm Hg matched for age, sex, and race was used for comparison.\nDuring a mean (+/- SD) follow-up time of 31 +/- 4 months, 37 (66%) patients with TP of 40 mm Hg or less remained stable, and 19 (34%) had ulceration (n = 10), rest pain (n = 6), or gangrene (n = 3). Nine (24%) of the 37 stable patients had gradual improvement of TP values greater than 40 mm Hg. Among the 19 patients whose conditions deteriorated, eight (42%) patients underwent successful bypasses, and five (26%) patients required amputations. Two patients who had rest pain had spontaneous resolution, and three patients who had ulcerations healed without intervention. In contrast, five (9%) of the case controls with TP greater than 40 mm Hg had rest pain (n = 2) or gangrene (n = 3) (p = 0.003). Among patients with TP of 40 mm Hg or less, there were no statistically significant differences between the stable patients and patients with deteriorating conditions in age, ankle-brachial indexes, or risk factors (including diabetes mellitus).

    "abstract": "To evaluate the results of femorofemoral bypass graft (FFBPG), we analyzed 110 consecutive FFBPGs performed at our institution during an 11-year period.\nIn 62 (56%) patients the indication for surgery was claudication and in 48 (44%) patients rest pain or tissue loss. In 42 patients the superficial femoral artery (SFA) was occluded. A preoperative percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) was performed in 24 (22%) patients to correct a significant donor iliac artery stenosis. In 48 (44%) patients a total of 54 arterial procedures were performed simultaneously with FFBPG.\nAfter surgery 75 (68%) patients were moderately or markedly improved, whereas 20 (18%) were minimally improved, unchanged, or worse, including 7 (6%) with hemodynamic failures. The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.5%. Actuarial patient survival rate was 70% +/- 8.6% at 6 years. The actuarial primary graft patency rate was 83% +/- 4.2% at 1 year, 71% +/- 6.9% at 3 years, 60% +/- 8.3% at 5 years, and 51% +/- 9.6% at 6 years. Age, sex, and race of the patient did not influence graft patency. Grafts placed for limb-threatening ischemia or in patients with SFA occlusion had a similar patency rate compared with those placed for claudication or in patients with patient SFA. The overall limb preservation rate was 83% +/- 7.3% at 5 years but was only 64% for patients who underwent operation for limb-threatening ischemia.\nIn conclusion, FFBPG offers moderately low long-term patency in a population with limited survival. Outflow procedures performed concomitantly with FFBPG seemed to compensate for the negative impact on graft patency rate of ipsilateral SFA occlusion and limb-threatening ischemia. Limb-threatening ischemia, however, carried a significantly higher (p < 0.05) amputation rate. The influence of preoperative donor iliac artery percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty on FFBPG patency remains unclear.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to explore new strategies for enhancing specific cell type attachment to biomaterials using immobilized lectins for cell surface glycoconjugates. The lectin Ulex europaeus I (UEA I) has a high affinity for human vascular endothelial cell surface glycoconjugates.\nUEA I was covalently bound to polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron) with the cross-linking agent 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride to achieve oligosaccharide-mediated endothelial cell attachment to this otherwise nonadherent surface.\nExperiments with radiolabeled UEA I demonstrated covalent linkage of as much as 1.35 micrograms/cm2. The lectin binding site is available after the reaction, as demonstrated in experiments a neoglycoprotein. Adhesion studies reveal a 100-fold increase in endothelial cell attachment for the UEA I/polyethylene terephthalate surface (99.7 +/- 29.6 cells/high-power field) when compared with untreated (0.7 +/- 0.5), crosslinking agent (0.4 +/- 0.3), and denatured UEA I (1.2 +/- 1.1) control groups. Five vascular endothelial cell lines adhered to the UEA I/polyethylene terephthalate surface, whereas monocytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts did not.\nThese results imply new strategies for endothelialization of prosthetic grafts and promotion of selective cell adherence to biomaterials, with emphasis on carbohydrate interactions. Moreover, this experimental system offers a model for exploring the biologic significance of the endothelial cell-UEA I ligand.",

The only early death occurred in a patient with systemic sepsis related to Staphylococcus aureus mycotic suprarenal aneurysm. Long-term survival of the remaining patients has been excellent: two patients died of unrelated causes at 5 and 6 years, respectively; one patient remains alive with known persistent infection at 5 years; and the remaining patients are alive with no evidence of infection at 1 1/2 and 10 years, respectively. Percutaneous aspiration of infected perigraft fluid with local instillation of antibiotics along with administration of intravenous antibiotics may provide palliation in selected patients with recurrent infections. In view of the magnitude of the problems associated with recurrent infection, life-time administration of antibiotics is recommended after in situ graft replacement of mycotic thoracoabdominal aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies of perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis have indicated an improved efficacy of beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporins compared with cefazolin, the most commonly used prophylactic agent. Previous studies in our institution have revealed a superiority of cefamandole to cefazolin in patients undergoing heart surgery, although there was no difference between cefazolin and cefuroxime in patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery. This study was therefore designed to compare cefamandole with cefazolin in wound infection prophylaxis in clean vascular surgery.\nThe study was conducted from August 1990 through May 1992 and consisted of 893 patients with aortic or infrainguinal arterial procedures randomized to receive either cefamandole or cefazolin.\nThe difference in infection rates associated with cefamandole versus cefazolin prophylaxis (3.2% vs 1.9%, respectively) was not significant (p = 0.42). A cost savings of approximately $95,000 per year at our institution favors the continued use of cefazolin over cefamandole. Risk factor analysis was carried out for preoperative and postoperative events that might have predisposed to infection. Only preoperative use of aspirin and the postoperative finding of a lymphocele correlated with a higher infection rate.\nCefazolin continues to be the most cost-effective antibiotic for prophylaxis in clean vascular surgical procedures.",

    "abstract": "Mesenteric arterial reconstruction in patients with acute or chronic intestinal ischemia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates. Reperfusion of ischemic bowel in animals leads to release of multiple factors that cause organ dysfunction. Similar phenomena potentially occur in human beings after repair of symptomatic chronic mesenteric arterial disease. The purpose of this study was to define the incidence of multiple organ dysfunction seen after reperfusion of the chronically ischemic bowel.\nBetween January 1990 and January 1993, 18 patients underwent surgical revascularization for symptomatic chronic mesenteric arterial occlusive disease. Four patients required emergency surgery, whereas 14 procedures were done electively. Hepatic, renal, pulmonary, and coagulation function were evaluated in all patients. Bypass graft patency was confirmed by duplex scanning or repeat operation in all patients with deteriorating conditions.\nImmediately after surgery hepatic function deteriorated. The serum transaminases increased 90- to 100-fold whereas lactate dehydrogenase increased 25-fold. Simultaneously, platelet counts dropped below 40,000 mm3 in 11 patients. On postoperative day 2, 16 patients had acute pulmonary insufficiency demonstrated by an increase in the pulmonary shunt fraction to a mean of 32% +/- 3% (range 21% to 60%). Ten patients required reintubation, and lung failure lasted an average of 8.4 days (range 1 to 35 days).

Transvenous catheter pulmonary embolectomy performed with the patient receiving local anesthetic provides an expeditious alternative to lytic therapy or open embolectomy on cardiopulmonary bypass.\nThe indication for embolectomy in this series of 46 patients was hypotension despite inotropic support in all but four patients (91%); the latter sustained major embolism and were respirator dependent. In the first 10 patients treated from 1970 to 1974, a metal cup attached to a straight catheter was used.\nHemodynamic improvement occurred in nine of 10 initial patients, but recurrent PE and a mortality rate of 50% prompted addition of a vena caval filter and directional control to the catheter. Subsequently 36 patients were treated with this combination from 1975 to 1992. Emboli were extracted in 76% (35 of 46) of the total series with a 30-day survival rate of 70% (32 of 46). Hemodynamic data showed an average reduction in mean pulmonary artery pressure of 8 mm Hg and a significant increase in mean cardiac output from 2.59 L/min to 4.47 L/min (p = 0.003) after embolectomy. Complications included wound hematoma (15%), pulmonary infarct (11%), recurrent deep venous thrombosis (6%), pleural effusion (4%), and myocardial infarction (4%).\nSuccessful embolectomy was most likely for categories of major PE (4 of 4, 100%) and massive PE (27 of 33, 82%) and least likely for chronic PE (5 of 9, 56%) (p < 0.03). Successful embolectomy also predicted long-term survival (p < 0.01), which was 89 months for the series (range 1 to 237 months).

    "abstract": "The incidence of complications, particularly paraplegia, remains high after surgical repair of DeBakey type IIIB chronic expanding dissecting aneurysms. In this report we cautiously advocate a new approach termed tailored aortoplasty, which allows the surgeon to achieve two primary goals: reduced renal/visceral and spinal cord ischemic time, and reperfusion of all patent inferior intercostal and superior lumbar arteries.\nTailored aortoplasty consists of incising the controlled aorta on the left posterolateral surface from T-8 to the infrarenal portion. The membrane separating the true and false lumen is excised, and the aortotomy is closed to a diameter of 2 1/2 to 3 cm to reduce wall tension.\nThe procedure has been applied to 13 patients, all of whom survived, nine without complications. One patient had paresis after profound cardiogenic shock. Three patients had hemorrhage, one from an excluded intercostal artery, one from a delayed splenic rupture, and one from the suture line. He was the only patient treated for acute dissection with rupture.\nConfining the procedure to chronic dissections, we found aortic tissues capable of holding sutures well, and there has been no expansion of the tailored segment on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in mean follow-up of 2.1 years.",

Patients with RAS had a higher prevalence of mild, controlled hypertension (p < 0.001) and mild renal insufficiency (p < 0.001), but in no case was arteriography obtained to diagnose renovascular hypertension or ischemic nephropathy.

The correlation between the prevalence of CAD and RAS severity was highly significant (p < 0.001), and the relative odds ratio of CAD was highest for RAS measuring 75% or greater. Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated three variables to be significantly and independently associated with CAD: 75% or greater RAS (p = 0.001), aortic aneurysm disease (p = 0.01), and hypertension (p = 0.001). RAS measuring 75% or greater diameter loss was associated with the highest estimated odds ratio: patients with this degree of RAS had a fourfold increase in the prevalence of clinically overt CAD. We also evaluated the relationship between RAS, mesenteric artery stenosis, and CAD; although RAS was more frequent among patients with mesenteric artery stenoses, mesenteric artery stenoses were not associated with CAD.\nUnsuspected RAS is common among patients with peripheral vascular disease and should be considered an independent marker for CAD.",

Aneurysms may occur after aortic prosthetic reconstruction for both occlusive and aneurysmal disease, may occur early or late, and may be classified as a pseudoaneurysm or true aneurysm.\nThirty-one cases in 29 patients treated at a tertiary referral center from 1980 to 1992 were retrospectively reviewed. Iliac and femoral aneurysms were excluded. The indication for initial abdominal aortic grafting had been aneurysmal disease in 19 patient and occlusive disease in 10 patients.\nThere were 25 pseudoaneurysms and six true aneurysms, the latter followed grafting for aneurysmal disease. The current aneurysm (mean size 7.1 cm) was at the proximal aortic anastomosis in 27 cases and at the distal aortic anastomosis in two cases. Symptoms at presentation included abdominal pain (14), mass (12), claudication (9), back pain (6), and gastrointestinal bleeding (3). Surgical management included interposition tube grafting (16), aortoiliofemoral bypass (9), and graft removal with extraanatomic bypass (3). The overall operative morbidity rate was 73%, and mortality rate was 21%.\nParaanastomotic aortic aneurysms are being increasingly recognized and are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Patients should be periodically studied after aortic grafting with abdominal ultrasonography for early detection of this potentially serious complication. Elective surgical repair is advocated in the effort to minimize morbidity rates.",

    "abstract": "Although the deep femoral artery (DFA) is well acknowledged as an outflow vessel for inflow reconstruction, data are lacking concerning the suitability of the DFA as an inflow site for distal bypass.\nFrom 1986 to 1992 we performed 268 consecutive infrainguinal reversed vein bypasses, of which 56 (21%) originated from the middle or distal DFA. The indications for DFA-origin grafts included inadequate vein length, need for concomitant extended profundaplasty, and avoidance of groin scarring from previous reconstruction or infection. The surgical approach to the DFA (standard, posteromedial, or lateral) was tailored to the patient. All grafts were monitored with serial duplex scanning surveillance.\nPrimary and secondary patency rates of DFA origin grafts were 78% and 96% at 3 years. These patency rates were no different from those grafts originating from the common femoral artery (66%; 89%), the superficial femoral artery (69%; 87%), or the popliteal artery (66%; 87%). Hemodynamic failure was detected in seven DFA-origin grafts, but only one resulted from disease in the common femoral artery or DFA proximal to the origin of the vein graft.\nDirect lateral and posteromedial approaches to the DFA were used extensively in repeat operative situations, avoiding dissection in a scarred groin and shortening the length of vein required to perform an autogenous bypass. We conclude that in appropriately selected patients, the DFA origin technique increases the versatility of lower extremity vein bypass grafting without sacrificing durability.",

    "abstract": "To determine why some vein grafts fail, we prospectively studied the relationship between the histologic condition of the greater saphenous vein (GSV) at the time of grafting and subsequent stenosis of the vein graft.\nNinety-four remnant segments of GSVs were obtained at the time of infrainguinal bypass in 91 patients and were perfusion fixed before histologic and ultrastructural examination. All bypass grafts were evaluated clinically and by duplex ultrasonography at regular intervals from 1 to 30 months after operation. All 24 grafts that developed lesions that caused thrombosis (failed grafts) or flow reduction (failing grafts) underwent arteriography and appropriate operative or other interventional correction of the causative lesion.\nThere was no significant difference in the incidence of coronary artery disease, kidney disease, hypertension, or history of smoking in patients with normally functioning and failed or failing grafts. Diabetes occurred with an increased frequency in failed or failing grafts (p = 0.056). At the time of their insertion, GSVs that subsequently developed significant lesions had thicker walls (0.72 +/- 0.33 mm) compared with normally functioning grafts (0.58 +/- 21 mm; p < 0.02). Most of this difference was related to a significantly thicker intima (0.27 +/- 0.17 vs 0.11 +/- 0.7 mm; p < 0.0001). Another significant finding was the presence of subendothelial spindle-shaped cells greater than five cell layers thick. This occurred more often in pregraft biopsies from grafts that developed significant lesions (70.4% vs 7.5%, p < 0.0001). Electron microscopic examination of these cells demonstrated a subpopulation of poorly differentiated cells with few fibers and many vesicles. Four of 24 (17%) failed or failing grafts had evidence of vein wall calcification at the time of vein grafting. This was seen in only one (1.4%) of 70 normally functioning grafts without lesions (p < 0.005).\nWe conclude that GSVs with thick and calcified walls or hypercellular intima at the time of grafting are at increased risk of developing intragraft lesions that may lead to graft failure. Frequent duplex ultrasonography surveillance is particularly warranted for such high-risk grafts.",

    "abstract": "Provision of lifelong angioaccess for hemodialysis generally requires multiple procedures. To extend the availability of each extremity as an access site, we have used the transposed basilic vein for fistula construction since 1988. Our purpose is to present our initial experience, with follow-up of 30 months.\nWe have used the transposed proximal basilic vein in 65 procedures to construct an autogenous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) to the brachial artery in 58 patients without suitable superficial venous anatomy. There were 25 males and 33 females, with a mean age of 47 years (range 10 to 77). The basilic vein transposition was the initial angioaccess procedure in only 25% of cases and secondary in 75%. Three additional patients underwent exploration of an inadequate basilic vein with subsequent prosthetic grafting.\nThere were no operative deaths. Two postoperative complications included a wound infection and a transient steal syndrome. The actuarial life-table patency rate for all successfully completed AVFs was 49% at 30 months. Late revisions with continued patency were required in 11 cases, including repair of a focal stenosis in six, pseudoaneurysm resection in two, and thrombectomy in one. Sixty-seven percent of patients who required subsequent prosthetic grafting for a failed basilic vein AVF had an ipsilateral procedure. Patient preference for the opposite arm was the usual indication for contralateral grafting in the remainder.\nThe transposed basilic vein AVF was technically feasible in 95% of cases, can frequently be performed in patients with multiple previous access procedures, does not compromise the arm for future prosthetic grafting, and has a long-term patency rate that is comparable to more traditional autologous AVFs. This underused procedure should be considered before placement of polytetrafluoroethylene graft for long-term angioaccess.",

    "abstract": "To define the value of renal duplex sonography (RDS) to detect the presence of critical renal artery (RA) stenosis or occlusion after surgical repair or percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTRA), we retrospectively reviewed our recent 71-month experience.\nFrom January 1987 through November 1992, 272 patients underwent 279 operative RA repairs and 35 patients underwent PTRA. Three hundred twenty-five RDS examinations were performed in 176 patients after operative intervention or PTRA during the study period. Forty-one of these patients had conventional angiography providing 61 RA for RDS comparison, and these data form the basis of this analysis. Twenty-four women and 17 men (mean age 57 years) underwent 44 operative RA repairs or 17 PTRA for correction of atherosclerotic disease (51 arteries) or fibromuscular dysplasia (10 arteries). Before their renovascular procedure each patient had significant hypertension (mean 193/106 mm Hg). RDS after surgery or PTRA was technically complete for all 61 RA.\nCompared with angiography RDS correctly identified 47 of 48 repairs with less than 60% RA stenosis , 7 of 11 repairs with 60% to 99% stenosis, and 2 renal artery occlusions, providing a 69% sensitivity rate, 98% specificity rate, 90% positive predictive value, and a 92% negative predictive value. These results were adversely affected by branch RA disease, which accounted for three of four false-negative RDS study results. For 50 kidneys undergoing correction of main RA disease, RDS demonstrated an 89% sensitivity rate, 98% specificity rate, and 96% overall accuracy. RDS results were equivalent for both surgical and PTRA treatment.\nFrom this experience we conclude that RDS is useful for anatomic evaluation after surgical RA repair or PTRA. A negative RDS result excludes stenosis or occlusion of a main RA reconstruction but does not exclude significant branch level disease.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to describe a technique for resection of extensive thoracoabdominal aneurysms, which the authors believe will lower morbidity and mortality rates.\nIn an effort to minimize the risk of spinal cord ischemia, we have used a combination of sided heart bypass (left atrium to left femoral artery) with local cooling of the intercostal and visceral arteries and segmental resection of the aneurysm. Segmental resection of the aneurysm allows perfusion of the spinal cord and abdominal viscera as the proximal anastomosis is completed and as each pair of intercostal arteries is reimplanted. An attempt is made to reimplant all pairs of intercostal arteries from T8 to L2. Before the intercostal or visceral arteries are reimplanted, that segment of aorta is cooled with cold crystalloid solution. Thus no segment of the aorta is exposed to warm ischemia for more than 30 minutes. Left-sided heart bypass allows the patient's temperature to be maintained between 35 degrees C and 37 degrees C.\nWe have used this technique in 23 patients with types I and II (Crawford's classification) thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Seven patients (30%) had dissections or rupture associated with their aneurysms and underwent emergency operation. One of these seven patients became paraplegic after operation, for a 4.3% incidence of paraplegia. One patient died of multiple organ failure after operation. No patient had kidney failure requiring dialysis.\nWe believe that our technique allows the operation to be performed in a deliberate manner with a low incidence of paraplegia and kidney failure.",

    "abstract": "The conventional management of prosthetic graft infection (PGI), including graft excision and extraanatomic revascularization, continues to be associated with substantial morbidity. Rotational muscle flap (RMF) closure of the infected wound, with preservation of the graft, is an alternative, albeit controversial, approach.\nOver the last 7 years, 22 RMF procedures have been performed to close 19 wounds in 18 patients, ranging in age from 39 to 79 (mean 63.7) years, with PGI. Twenty-one grafts constructed of Dacron (13) or polytetrafluoroethylene (8) were covered in the groin (16), neck (2), or chest (1). The clinical presentations included abscess or purulent drainage in 14 grafts, hemorrhage in three, and infected false aneurysm in two wounds; positive bacterial culture results were obtained in each case.\nThere was one (5.6%) operative death. Healing was achieved in the 18 wounds of the 17 operative survivors. No patients have been lost to follow-up. Three (17.6%) of these 17 patients had recurrent infection, including one patient who underwent a secondary RMF procedure with graft salvage, one who underwent excision of an occluded graft, and one who underwent excision and extraanatomic bypass and died. Four other patients died 1 to 6 (mean 3) months after RMF closure with healed wounds. Eleven (92%) of the 12 survivors have healed wounds and intact grafts with follow-up ranging from 8 to 83 (mean 39) months. For the entire series 15 (88%) of these 17 patients had healed wounds and intact grafts, with a mean follow-up of 30 months.\nThese results suggest that RMF procedures are well tolerated and can achieve acceptable long-term graft salvage in selected patients with PGI.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness of screening for coronary artery disease before elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) was performed.\nResults of a screening algorithm for coronary artery disease in 263 patients admitted to a single hospital for elective repair of AAA between January 1986 and December 1989 were analyzed. Patients with no coronary artery disease indicators proceeded to surgery without further workup. Patients with cardiac disease indicators underwent dipyridamole-thallium scintigraphy, and patients with angina were screened by use of cardiac catheterization; those with a recent coronary revascularization underwent no additional screening unless symptoms or electrocardiographic changes suggested an intervening event. Twenty-eight patients underwent no screen other than medical history and electrocardiogram.\nAmong 164 patients screened with dipyridamole-thallium scintigraphy, 44 patients had redistribution defects that required catheterization, and 11 of these underwent coronary revascularization. Cardiac catheterization was performed directly in 42 patients, which led to 11 revascularizations before AAA repair. Previous coronary artery bypass or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty obviated additional screening in 29 patients. Of the 263 scheduled AAA repairs, 15 were cancelled because of unacceptable operative risks, 13 for cardiac reasons. One patient died of a ruptured AAA after an uneventful coronary artery bypass. Among the 247 AAA repairs performed, there were three perioperative deaths (1.2%), all of which resulted from sudden cardiac events; three additional patients had nonfatal myocardial infarctions (1.2%), for a total cardiac complication rate of 2.4%.\nThe low rate of cardiac complications in this experience affirms the effectiveness of preoperative screening and selective coronary revascularization before AAA repair.",

    "abstract": "Complications of grafts infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci can be eradicated by antibiotic administration, tissue debridement, and in situ graft replacement, but successful treatment may be diminished in a setting of altered immune function.\nIn a canine model of an established aortic graft infection from Staphylococcus epidermidis, outcomes after in situ replacement were compared between normal dogs and animals made immune-deficient by administration of azathioprine (50 mg/day) and prednisone (10 mg/day). In situ replacement of an infected infrarenal aortic graft with either antibiotic-bonded (silver-ciprofloxacin: Ag-cipro) or conventional polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts was performed in 17 control and 18 immune-deficient animals.\nFour weeks after implantation of a Dacron graft colonized with a biofilm of S. epidermidis, all study animals demonstrated a bacterial biofilm infection with perigraft inflammation or abscess, and in immune-suppressed dogs the incidence of perianastomotic aortitis was increased (p < 0.05). Six weeks after in situ replacement both the Ag-cipro and conventional PTFE grafts were healed without signs of infection in controls, but anatomic evidence of persistent infection and increased S. epidermidis recovery was observed in immune-suppressed animals that underwent in situ replacement of a standard (five of seven) versus antibiotic-bonded (one of 11) PTFE graft (p < 0.006). Overall in situ replacement with an antibiotic-bonded graft yielded a lower frequency of S. epidermidis recovery (two of 19 Ag-cipro graft biofilm with positive culture results versus nine of 16 conventional graft biofilm with positive culture results; (p < 0.003).\nThis study supports the efficacy of in situ replacement for low-grade graft infections caused by S. epidermidis in normal hosts and demonstrates superiority of antibiotic-bonded grafts in immune-deficient hosts.",

Both patients were first seen with acute pulmonary embolism and were treated with thrombolytic therapy followed by anticoagulation. Each had recurrent venous thromboembolism before discovery of the popliteal venous aneurysm. One popliteal venous aneurysm was diagnosed with phlebography and the second with venous duplex imaging, confirmed with phlebography. Both were surgically corrected with tangential aneurysmectomy and lateral venorrhaphy. Twenty-four cases of popliteal venous aneurysm are now available for review. Seventy-one percent (17 of 24) presented with pulmonary embolism, 88% (21 of 24) were saccular, and 96% (23 of 24) were located in the proximal popliteal vein. All but two were diagnosed by ascending phlebography. Three patients received no treatment: in two of these the outcome was not documented and the third had occasional pain. Two patients received anticoagulation without subsequent operative repair and both died of recurrent pulmonary emboli. Operative correction resulted in a 75% patency rate with 21% complications, most of which were related to postoperative anticoagulation. No patient who was operated on had subsequent pulmonary embolism, and there were no operative deaths. We suggest that all patients who have pulmonary embolism have lower-extremity venous duplex imaging. All popliteal venous aneurysms should be surgically repaired, inasmuch as nonoperative therapy results in recurrent thromboembolism and an unacceptably high mortality rate. Tangential aneurysmectomy with lateral venorrhaphy is the recommended procedure.",

    "abstract": "Whether small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) (< or = 5 cm in diameter) should be repaired early to enhance late survival remains controversial. Long-term population-based data on the surgical outcome for small AAAs may help to establish practice guidelines until randomized clinical trials are completed.\nTo examine an entire community experience with small AAAs, we conducted a population-based analysis of the recognition, reasons for operation, perioperative mortality rates, and late survival in Olmsted County, Minnesota.\nThe incidence of recognized small AAAs increased thirtyfold during a 30-year period. The propensity to repair small AAAs also increased during the same period. Eventually one third of small AAAs were repaired. The primary reasons for surgical consultation and operation were presence of the aneurysm (49%), expansion on serial examination (28%), nonspecific abdominal or back symptoms (18%), and excessive patient anxiety about the aneurysm (5%). Community operative mortality rates for small AAAs were low (2.6%) compared with those for large aneurysms (5.5%) (p = 0.65). However, the observed 5-year survival rate for the group undergoing repair of small aneurysms was 62%, which was significantly less than the 83% expected survival for the general population (p < 0.05). Relative survival for the operated small and large aneurysms was similar. The primary cause of death for both groups was myocardial infarction.\nThe results of our population-based analysis indicate that early operative results for elective repair of small AAAs are excellent, but late survival remains significantly impaired by coronary heart disease. Consequently, our data question whether early repair of small AAAs will enhance late survival. Until randomized clinical trials on management of small AAAs are completed, most small AAAs should be monitored for expansion and operated on electively when they approach or enter the range of 5 to 6 cm in good-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the current role of diagnostic tests done before carotid endarterectomy and the need for routine arteriography.\nWe prospectively studied vascular surgeons' decision-making over a 29-month period during which 111 carotid arteries in 103 patients were considered for endarterectomy. For each case the surgeon's management plan was recorded after clinical evaluation and review of the duplex scan findings, but before arteriography. This plan was later compared with the patient's ultimate clinical management.\nOf 111 total cases in this period, 17 were excluded from analysis because arteriography was not done or it was performed before the surgeon's evaluation. Carotid duplex scans were diagnostic in 87 (93%) of the remaining 94 cases. The carotid lesion was incompletely assessed by duplex scanning in seven patients because the disease was not limited to the distal common or proximal internal carotid artery (n = 4); anatomic or pathologic features of the carotid artery interfered with imaging or accurate Doppler assessment (n = 1); or an internal carotid artery occlusion could not be distinguished from a high-grade stenosis (n = 2). When a technically adequate duplex scan showed significant disease of the carotid bifurcation, arteriography contributed information that affected clinical management in only a single case (1%). This patient had a middle cerebral artery occlusion distal to a high-grade carotid bifurcation stenosis.\nClinical assessment and duplex scanning were sufficient for the preoperative evaluation of 93% of the candidates for carotid endarterectomy. Clinical circumstances or atypical duplex scan findings can be used to identify the minority of patients for whom arteriography is necessary. On the basis of this experience, we have developed practical guidelines for the selective use of arteriography before carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "The benefit of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in preventing recurrent stroke in patients who have sustained a previous stroke remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immediate results and long-term benefit of CEA after recovery from a prior ipsilateral stroke.\nBetween 1980 and 1990, 85 patients underwent CEA for prior stroke with an average follow up of 54 months (range 0.3 to 130). The interval from prior stroke to CEA averaged 19.8 months (range 0.1 to 158.3). Vascular risk factors included hypertension in 70.6%, diabetes in 20.0%, history of smoking in 80.0%, and associated coronary artery disease in 51.8% of the patients.\nThere were no perioperative deaths. Four patients (4.7%) had an ipsilateral stroke within 30 days of operation. During the follow up 31 patients (36.5%) died. The leading cause of death was cardiac (54.8%) followed by cancer (16.1%). By life-table methods, the cumulative incidence of recurrent stroke at 9 years was 14% for strokes in the ipsilateral distribution, for an annual stroke risk of 1.6% per year. The cumulative incidence of stroke in other distributions was 5%, for an annual stroke risk of 2.1% per year for all strokes. When interval to operation, preoperative stroke severity, vascular risk factors, and neurologic symptoms were evaluated, no independent indicator of increased risk of recurrent postoperative stroke could be identified.\nThese results demonstrate a marked improvement over the natural history and best medical therapy for these lesions as reoperated in the literature. We conclude that CEA is beneficial in preventing recurrent stroke in this group of patients and should be considered the appropriate management in this setting.",

    "abstract": "Large ischemic wounds, particularly with exposed bone or tendons, may not heal even after successful revascularization. We have taken an aggressive approach for limb salvage that uses autogenous vein grafting and simultaneous microvascular free tissue transfer.\nIn the past year, seven patients (average age 67 years; range 56 to 79) with ischemic disease and distal ulceration underwent revascularization for limb salvage and free tissue transfer. Each had a nonhealing wound (average size 80 cm2), present for 8.6 months (range 2 to 24 months). Simultaneous vein bypass and free tissue transfer was performed in four (57%) of the seven patients.\nAll flaps were initially viable; however, one was lost on day 4 because of hypotension and congestive heart failure. One patient with a successful flap died at 1 month of pneumonia. Minor wound complications were seen in four (57%) of seven patients. Five of the seven patients had the wounds heal completely and are ambulatory at an average follow up of 10 months.\nOur aggressive approach was successful in preserving limb length and function in 71% of our patients. We perform simultaneous procedures whenever possible to minimize operative and hospitalization times.

    "abstract": "Vascular clamps, vessel loops, and intraluminal occluding devices used to control tibial and pedal vessels can be injurious and may fail to occlude heavily calcified arteries. In an effort to prevent injury to these small arteries, we have investigated the safety and efficacy of thigh pneumatic tourniquet occlusion for distal vascular control during infrapopliteal reconstruction.\nDuring an 18-month period, 88 tibial or pedal arterial reconstructions were performed on 80 patients (mean age 75 years) by the tourniquet technique. Data regarding indications for operation, preoperative evaluation, intraoperative findings, surgical technique, and early outcome were recorded prospectively.\nSixty percent of patients were diabetic: 36% insulin dependent and 24% non-insulin dependent. The indications for operation were claudication in 6 (7%), ischemic ulcer in 24 (27%), rest pain in 25 (28%), and gangrene in 33 (38%) patients. Thirty-five percent of operations followed failed ipsilateral infrainguinal reconstructions. The peroneal artery was the target vessel in 38%, anterior tibial in 26%, posterior tibial in 23%, tibioperoneal trunk in 9%, and inframalleolar vessels in 4% of cases. Preoperative analog waveforms and ankle-brachial indexes were used to classify the tibial arteries as compliant, 49%; relatively noncompressible, 30%; and absolutely noncompressible, 9%. Twelve percent had no Doppler flow at the ankle level. At operation 36 of the target arteries (41%) had mural calcification. Tourniquet pressures of 200 to 400 mm Hg (mode 250 mm Hg) were applied from 13 to 55 minutes (mean 27.1 +/- 9.1 minutes). All patients were given systemic anticoagulants. In 19 limbs (22%) the tourniquet was used to occlude a patent superficial femoral artery above the proximal (inflow) anastomosis to either the superficial femoral artery (8%), the above-knee popliteal artery (5%), or the below-knee popliteal artery (9%). Hemostasis was adequate in all cases and no alternative occlusive devices were required. There were no significant complications attributable to the use of the pneumatic tourniquet.\nTourniquet occlusion simplifies the infrapopliteal dissection, lessens operating time, improves visualization of the distal anastomosis, and removes the potential for arterial injury to the target vessel. Arterial calcification and noncompressible tibial arteries do not contraindicate the use of thigh tourniquet occlusion. This technique is preferred for all patients undergoing tibial or pedal artery reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "The outcome of leg bypass in women is unknown. To date, most series of lower extremity bypass have included few women, and the results in women compared with those in men have not been reported. The experience with infrainguinal arterial reconstruction in women treated at the Oregon Health Sciences University has been greater than previously reported. We have reviewed our recent experience with lower extremity bypass to determine whether results in women differ significantly from those in men.\nIn the past 11 years we have performed 823 infrainguinal arterial reconstructions for lower extremity ischemia in 585 patients, of which 357 procedures were performed in women and 466 procedures were performed in men. The mean ages were 65 years for men and 68 years for women. Diabetes was present in 59% of the men and 48% of the women. Among men, 84% had a history of tobacco use compared with 66% of the women. Bypasses in men were performed for limb salvage in 73%, claudication in 22%, and a failing bypass graft in 5% of cases. Bypasses in women were performed for limb salvage in 79%, claudication in 15%, and a failing graft in 6% of cases. Previous revascularizations had been performed in 63% of the men and 71% of the women. Autogenous vein was used in 97% of the bypasses in men and 96% of bypasses in women. Graft distribution among infrainguinal arterial target sites was similar between the groups. Bypasses in men were femoral to above-knee popliteal in 11%, femoral to below-knee popliteal in 40%, femoral to tibial in 38%, popliteal to tibial in 10%, and tibial to tibial in 1% of cases. Bypasses in women were femoral to above-knee popliteal in 14%, femoral to below-knee popliteal in 43%, femoral to tibial in 33%, popliteal to tibial in 9%, and tibial to tibial in 1% of cases.\nPerioperative 30-day mortality rates were 3.7% overall, 4.3% in men, and 2.9% in women. Long-term survival at 1, 3, and 5 years in men was 80%, 59%, and 44%, respectively. Long-term survival at 1, 3, and 5 years in women was 83%, 69%, and 44%, respectively. Life-table primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 86%, 77%, and 71% for men and 87%, 74%, and 67% for women. Limb-salvage results at 1 and 5 years were 93% and 91% for men and 96% and 96% for women.\nThese results indicate that long-term graft patency and limb salvage results in women are identical to those obtained in men in this experience with autogenous vein. Infrainguinal arterial reconstruction can be performed in women with mortality rates similar to those of men. In this series long-term survival was similar for both men and women.",

    "abstract": "Revascularization for chronic lower extremity ischemia (CLEI) in patients 80 or more years of age is controversial. High operative mortality, short remaining life span, and nonambulatory nursing home existence are cited as frequent outcomes in this patient group. Despite these considerations we have maintained an aggressive policy of lower extremity revascularization in functional and potentially functional patients 80 or more years of age with limb-threatening ischemia or claudication sufficient to threaten their independence.\nThe records of all patients 80 or more years of age who underwent lower extremity revascularization for CLEI from 1981 through 1991 were reviewed. Patients were evaluated for surgical indication, perioperative mortality, late survival, graft patency, and limb salvage. In addition, the patient's preoperative and postoperative independence determined by living situation (home versus nursing home) and ambulatory status were examined.\nDuring the period reviewed 88 patients 80 or more years of age underwent 95 arterial reconstructions for CLEI; 95% for limb salvage and 5% for short-distance claudication. There were 81 (85%) infrainguinal bypasses and 14 (15%) extra-anatomic bypasses, 5 of which also included a simultaneously placed infrainguinal bypass. The perioperative mortality rate was 6%. Mean hospitalization was 18 days (range 6 to 62). The 1- and 3-year primary graft patency rates were 88% and 66%, limb salvage rates 94% and 91%, and patient survival rates 73% and 51%, respectively. One year after operation 88% of patients were ambulatory, 85% were living at home, and 80% were both living at home and ambulatory. At 3 years these results were 86%, 76%, and 71%, respectively. Of the patients living at home and ambulatory before operation, 100% and 84% of survivors were still living at home and ambulatory 1 and 3 years after operation. Of patients living at home who had late graft occlusions, 67% required amputation and subsequent nursing home placement.\nAlthough survival in this group is predictably lower than that of age-matched control subjects, octogenarians have satisfactory 1- and 3-year graft patency, limb salvage, and functional results. Revascularization for CLEI in patients 80 or more years of age is appropriate and results in maintenance of independent living in a large majority.",

This study was designed to extend these observations by determining the 2-year cardiac prognosis of patients at high risk undergoing abdominal aortic versus infrainguinal vascular operations.\nData included historical, clinical, and laboratory data collected during the in-hospital period, and at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. This information was collected independently of the usual clinical care visits. Data were analyzed with Cox's proportional hazards model.\nThere were 11 in-hospital deaths overall (five [9%] aortic; six [7%]) infrainguinal). 628 days (median 726 days). Fifteen patients (12%) had fatal myocardial infarctions, two (4%) of which occurred in patients who underwent aortic procedures and 13 (16%) of which occurred in patients who underwent infrainguinal operations. Nonfatal myocardial infarctions befell one (2%) patient undergoing aortic surgery and four (5%) patients undergoing infrainguinal surgery. One (2%) patient undergoing aortic surgery and three (4%) patients undergoing infrainguinal surgery were admitted to the hospital with unstable angina during the follow-up period. In all, adverse cardiac outcomes occurred in 20 of 81 (25%) patients who had infrainguinal procedures compared with four of 48 (8%) patients who had aortic operations (p = 0.04). Multivariate analysis showed that a history of diabetes (p = 0.001) and definite coronary artery disease (p = 0.01) are independently associated with adverse outcomes after both types of peripheral vascular operations.\nThe incidence of long-term adverse cardiac outcomes in patients at high risk undergoing infrainguinal operations is substantially greater than in those undergoing aortic operations, mostly because of a greater prevalence of diabetes, and definite coronary artery disease in the former group.",

    "abstract": "Although venous valvular insufficiency is well recognized as the most important etiologic mechanism in the development of the postthrombotic syndrome, the factors contributing to valve incompetence after deep venous thrombosis remain obscure.\nTo establish the relationship between recanalization and valve competence, 113 patients with acute deep venous thrombosis were studied with serial duplex ultrasonography.\nMedian lysis times for segments developing reflux (214 to 474 days) were 2.3 to 7.3 times longer than for corresponding segments not developing reflux (65 to 130 days) for all except the posterior tibial vein. In the posterior tibial vein, median lysis times for those with and without reflux were nearly identical (72 vs 80 days). The median time to onset of reflux was significantly less than the median lysis time in the mid and distal superficial femoral veins and was simultaneous with recanalization in all other segments.\nEarly recanalization is important in preserving valve integrity for all but the posterior tibial segment. However, the small number of patients with reflux despite early lysis (< 1 month) or without reflux despite relatively late lysis (> 9 to 12 months) suggests that other factors may also contribute to the development of valvular incompetence. These factors may be particularly important in the posterior tibial vein, in which lysis time has little relationship to the ultimate development of reflux.",

    "abstract": "Our purpose was to evaluate whether a method for quantification of platelet aggregability will predict failure of knitted Dacron femoropopliteal bypass grafts.\nA numerically derived platelet aggregation (PA) score, based on the aggregation pattern and platelet count, was determined in the 40 patients available for platelet analysis who underwent 53 femoropopliteal bypass grafts with preclotted, 6 mm, externally supported knitted Dacron grafts from 1981 to 1991 (mean follow-up 50 months). The preoperative score was found to remain stable after surgery, enabling the use of postoperative values when preoperative values were not available. The PA score was available in 19 patients (23 grafts) before surgery and 23 patients (30 grafts) after surgery. The following factors were analyzed for predicting graft failure by the Cox proportional hazards regression model: PA score, age, gender, history of smoking, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, claudication versus limb salvage, site of the distal anastomosis, previous ipsilateral bypass, and state of the runoff as determined by preoperative angiography.\nOf the studied risk factors, the value of the PA score was the most significant predictor of graft closure (p < 0.0001). An increase of 10 units was associated with an increased relative risk of 2.02. Throughout the follow-up period, 15 of 16 grafts remained patent in patients with a PA score of 15 or less, but only 2 grafts out of 17 remained patent in patients with a PA score of 30 or greater.\nThese data suggest that the PA score is a potential risk factor for failure of femoropopliteal bypass with externally supported knitted Dacron grafts.",

    "abstract": "A prosthetic venous valve must be biocompatible and nonthrombogenic and function in the venous circulation. Biocompatibility and thrombogenicity of our prosthesis have been examined in prior animal experiments, and 91% of valve conduits including early prototypes are patent at 3 weeks. However, evaluation of valve function is much more difficult in animals; therefore in this study the function of excised valves was evaluated ex vivo.\nNine bovine jugular vein conduits, each with one bileaflet venous valve, were harvested and placed in a venous flow simulator. Flows and pressures were adjusted to mimic human respiratory and hydrostatic variations. Each valve and conduit was tested for variations in valve diameter and sinus expansion in response to flow. Valve opening and closing times and valve competence were measured in response to pressure changes. After testing, each specimen was glutaraldehyde fixed and assessed a second time.\nValve orifice area increased in response to flow in both fresh and fixed tissues. Maximum valve orifice area was reduced by fixation (27.7%) at full flows (p < 0.05). Valve sinus dimensions increased in response to increased pressure until maximum expansion was achieved (33 mm Hg). This was reduced 15.3% in fixed tissue (p < 0.05). Valve opening times (at < 1 mm Hg gradient) were slightly longer in fixed compared with fresh tissue (0.43 +/- 0.09 vs 0.41 +/- 0.13 second; p < 0.05). Valve closing times were comparable in both states (0.43 +/- 0.08 vs 0.49 +/- 0.07 second). Three fresh and seven fixed specimens that were subjected to 287 mm Hg back pressure exhibited minimal reflux.\nSize and availability make the bovine jugular vein valve an ideal venous valve substitute. Glutaraldehyde fixation renders the tissue biocompatible and nonthrombogenic while preserving anatomic integrity and leaflet strength and flexibility. Mounted and stented in a sewing sleeve, this prosthesis could represent the first generally applicable clinical solution to chronic venous insufficiency and venous hypertension.",

    "abstract": "The ideal conduit for hemodialysis vascular access remains elusive. Autogenous fistulas and prosthetic grafts, most commonly expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE), have adequate long-term patency rates (60% to 80% at 1 year); however, considerable delay in their use (2 to 6 weeks) is required. The Plasma-TFE graft is a recently introduced thin-walled woven Dacron graft to which an ultrathin layer of tetrafluoroethylene is bonded through a process of glow-discharge polymerization. This process purportedly results in a graft with an internal surface of low thrombogenicity. Low thrombogenicity, combined with the healing characteristics of a woven graft, have led to claims of equivalent patency rates even when used for dialysis immediately (within 1 week) after implantation.\nThis concept led us to use this new graft material in 19 fistulas (12 forearm and 7 arm) during a 1-year period.\nAlthough early use was possible, the primary and secondary patency rate at 12 months was only 47.4%. Ten grafts required replacement, five within the first month and two in the second month. Attempts at fistula revision failed because of unsuccessful graft thrombectomy or exuberant intimal hyperplasia. Failure was not associated with early use. During the same time period, 28 PTFE grafts were implanted, with only four failures (primary patency 78.6%; secondary patency 85.7%; p = 0.028). The secondary patency rate was the same for Plasma-TFE grafts (47%) but improved to 85.7% for e-PTFE grafts (p = 0.005). Both groups were comparable with respect to age, diabetes, previous dialysis access procedures, and other comorbid conditions.\nThese early results have been sufficiently disappointing that we have abandoned use of this graft approved for hemodialysis by the Food and Drug Administration and cannot recommend it for other clinical indications. Nevertheless, the concept of plasma-discharge polymerization is theoretically attractive and might be useful in future graft configurations.",

    "abstract": "The lack of a suitable alternative to autogenous vein is often the limiting factor for complex lower extremity vascular reconstruction, especially when previously placed grafts have failed. Cryopreserved saphenous vein allografts have been used as an alternative conduit. This report reviews our early experience with this conduit in a series of complex redo revascularization procedures for limb salvage when no suitable autogenous vein was available.\nThirty-five patients underwent 39 lower extremity bypass grafts on 36 limbs. These patients had undergone a combined total of 72 prior revascularization procedures on the symptomatic limb, an average of two procedures per patient. Only five bypasses were performed as a primary procedure. There were 18 men and 17 women with a mean age of 71 years. Sixteen of the patients had diabetes. Thirty-four bypasses were performed for rest pain or ulceration, four for disabling claudication, and one for replacement of an aneurysmal vein graft. There were 35 femorotibial, three below-knee femoropopliteal, and one femoropedal reconstruction. Twenty-five grafts were constructed with cryopreserved vein only, whereas 14 were composite grafts; 10 were constructed with polytetrafluoroethylene, one with Dacron, and three with spliced native saphenous vein. The mean follow-up was 9 months (range 1 to 25 months).\nThere was one early death (< 30 days) and two late deaths. Two patients died with a patent graft. There have been 12 early graft closures and an additional 17 late failures, resulting in primary cumulative graft patency rates of 67%, 56%, 43%, 28%, and 14% at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively. Surgically correctable causes, including technical error and anastomotic stenosis, could be identified in 13 of the 29 graft failures. Salvage of failed grafts resulted in secondary cumulative graft patency rates of 87%, 77%, 61%, 46%, and 37% at these same intervals. There was no significant difference in primary or secondary graft patency rates related to diabetes, ABO graft compatibility, graft composition or orientation, indication for surgery, state of the outflow tract, or site of distal anastomosis. Limb salvage was attained in 24 (67%) of the 36 limbs. Two amputations were necessary despite patent grafts.\nBecause of the poor overall graft patency rates, cryopreserved saphenous vein allografts should be used only as a last resort when no alternative autogenous conduit is available. Unless patency rates superior to those achievable with currently available prosthetic or biologic conduits can be attained by adjunctive measures such as routine anticoagulation or immunosuppressive therapy, the use of cryopreserved saphenous vein allografts for lower extremity revascularization should be deferred until improved preparation techniques provide a more durable conduit.",

    "abstract": "Autogenous vein bypass grafts to infrapopliteal outflow sites have patency and limb salvage rates significantly superior to those obtained with prosthetic grafts. However, when infrageniculate bypass is required for limb-threatening ischemia in the patient lacking suitable autogenous veins, nonautogenous reconstruction or primary amputation are the only other alternatives.\nDuring a 2-year period we implanted 25 cryopreserved allograft saphenous vein bypass grafts in 24 patients (median age 76 years) with tissue necrosis (20 patients), rest pain (4 patients), or acute ischemia (1 patient); 16 patients were men and 8 were women. As many as six previous revascularizations were performed in 79%; two grafts extended to the infrageniculate popliteal artery; 23 grafts extended to a paramalleolar vessel.\nSecondary patency at 1 month was 87%, but only 36% at 1 year. Use of warfarin (Coumadin) failed to improve the patency rate (five of nine occlusions treated with Coumadin versus eight of 16 not treated with Coumadin). Only eight of 24 patients are alive with open grafts; nine patients have died.\nUnheralded occlusions more typical of prosthetic graft failure tempered the initial enthusiasm and effectiveness of vein allografts. All autogenous options must be exhausted to complete distal, secondary revascularization before resorting to nonautogenous conduits. Use of allograft veins must be viewed with continued skepticism.",

To obviate the need for operative exposure of the distal vertebral artery at the base of the skull, we elected to perform duplex-directed manual occlusion of the lesion. Angiography before and after the procedure, as well as 10-month follow-up duplex ultrasonography, demonstrated satisfactory thrombosis of the false aneurysm without evidence of a residual arterial defect. There was no morbidity associated with the procedure. We conclude that duplex-directed manual occlusion, a new technique recently described for the nonoperative management of postcatheterization femoral false aneurysms, can be applied safely and effectively to false aneurysms in other locations in which the risks and technical difficulties of operative repair render surgery less desirable.",

These constituted 18% of an overall experience of 194 tibial or pedal bypasses performed during that time. Preoperative and intraoperative arteriograms were reviewed to identify anatomic characteristics associated with successful limb salvage.\nSecondary patency rates for peroneal bypass grafts (70%) compared with the other tibial and pedal bypass grafts (65%) did not differ significantly at 48 months by life-table analysis. Limb salvage achieved by peroneal artery bypass grafting was significantly worse (55%) than that achieved by the remaining tibial and pedal bypasses (67%) at 48 months. Limb salvage was 33% at 7 months for those undergoing peroneal artery bypass grafting as opposed to 57% at 48 months for patients undergoing other tibial or pedal revascularizations with tissue necrosis. Four anatomic features were identified that were associated with failure after peroneal artery bypass grafting. These were peroneal length less than 10 cm (p = 0.012), peroneal artery diameter less than 2 mm (p = 0.035), absence of arteriographically demonstrated collaterals perfusing the foot (p = 0.0001), and little or no visualization of the pedal arch (p = 0.008).\nAlthough successful grafts may avoid amputation in carefully selected cases, alternatives to peroneal artery bypass grafting should be considered when less than favorable anatomic conditions are encountered, particularly in the presence of forefoot tissue necrosis.",

There were 211 grafts in 184 patients (195 limbs). Two and 5 years after the operation, primary patency rates were 37% and 23% and secondary patency rates were 45% and 25%, respectively. The main negative predictive factors for patency rate were an occluded primary plantar arch artery and poor vessel runoff. Primary bypass procedures had markedly better success rates than secondary (repeat) procedures, with primary patency rates of 52% at 2 years and 42% at 4 years, whereas the corresponding rates for secondary procedures were 22% and 14%, respectively. The 5-year cumulative limb salvage rate was 51% for the total series.\nAlthough the patency of prosthetic grafts is not as satisfactory as that of autologous vein grafts, the limb salvage rate justifies an aggressive approach to infrapopliteal bypass grafting with polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses when the limb is threatened and vein is not available.",

There were 211 grafts in 184 patients (195 limbs). Two and 5 years after the operation, primary patency rates were 37% and 23% and secondary patency rates were 45% and 25%, respectively. The main negative predictive factors for patency rate were an occluded primary plantar arch artery and poor vessel runoff. Primary bypass procedures had markedly better success rates than secondary (repeat) procedures, with primary patency rates of 52% at 2 years and 42% at 4 years, whereas the corresponding rates for secondary procedures were 22% and 14%, respectively. The 5-year cumulative limb salvage rate was 51% for the total series.",

    "abstract": "Endotoxemia has been associated with syndromes such as adult respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure. Translocation of endotoxins from the gut has been demonstrated to occur experimentally in animals after splanchnic ischemia.\nWe investigated endotoxemia in 11 patients with hemorrhagic shock caused by a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and in five patients after elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Endotoxin was measured quantitatively with a limulus assay with a detection limit of 12.5 pg/ml.\nIn 7 of the 11 patients admitted to the hospital with an acute condition endotoxin was present on admission (range 15 to 25 pg/ml), even before resuscitation and operation were started. In patients treated electively endotoxin was noticed after cross-clamping of the aorta in four of five patients (mean +/- SEM: 18.9 +/- 4.6 pg/ml). After reperfusion endotoxemia increased and was present in all patients (22.8 +/- 2.8 pg/ml). All five patients treated electively had an uneventful recovery without specific organ failures or infectious complications.\nIt is concluded that systemic endotoxemia as monitored by the limulus assay is a common finding in patients after major vascular operation. Hemorrhagic shock resulting in splanchnic ischemia may lead to endotoxemia. Ischemia and especially reperfusion after aortic cross-clamping also result in endotoxin translocation. However, the low concentrations of systemic circulating endotoxin found were not related to subsequent adverse effects of either the patients treated for acute conditions or in the electively treated patients.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) and operation as initial therapy with regard to technical results, primary and secondary patency, and effects on blood pressure and renal function in patients with atherosclerotic unilateral renal artery stenosis.\nFifty-eight patients who did not have diabetes, who were less than 70 years of age, and who had severe hypertension and significant stenosis were randomized to receive PTRA or operation. Angiography was performed 10 days, 1 year, and 2 years after treatment to verify patency, and blood pressure and renal function were simultaneously evaluated.\nTechnically, PTRA was successful in 83% and operation in 97% of patients. The primary patency rate after 24 months was 75% in the PTRA group and 96% in the operative group in technically successful cases. The secondary patency rate in the PTRA group was 90% and in the surgical group 97%. To achieve these results four patients in the PTRA group required operation, and one patient in the surgical group required PTRA. Hypertension was cured or improved after additional treatment in 90% of the patients after PTRA and 86% after operation. The corresponding figures for improved or unchanged renal function were 83% and 72%, respectively. After additional treatment, effects on blood pressure and renal function did not differ. Seventeen percent of the patients treated with PTRA required surgical intervention.\nPTRA is recommended as first choice of therapy for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis causing renovascular hypertension if combined with intensive follow-up and aggressive reintervention.",

    "abstract": "There is controversy in the surgical management of varicose veins between stripping of the long saphenous vein (LSV) and high ligation. Moreover, preservation of the LSV is desirable for future coronary or peripheral artery bypass. We have studied 75 limbs in 44 patients after high saphenous ligation with multiple stab phlebectomy.\nSubjective assessment of the outcome of surgery was made with a linear analog scale, and objective cosmetic outcome was assessed by an independent observer (LF) who had not been involved in the surgical treatment of these patients with our modification from the criteria first described by Jakobsen. Patency, length, and diameter of the LSV was measured 6 to 14 months (mean 12 months) after operation with a duplex scanner and a color-flow scanner. Valvular incompetence in the LSV and perforators was also assessed.\nResults show a good subjective and objective outcome in 95% and 97% of limbs, respectively. The LSVs were patent from ankle to groin in 68% and from ankle to knee in 82%, with a mean diameter of 4.0 +/- 0.1 mm (mean +/- SEM). There was no statistically significant difference in symptomatic outcome and presence of reflux in the LSV (X2 = 0.465; p = 0.4954; NS) or objective cosmetic outcome and the presence of reflux in the LSV (chi 2 = 2.916; p = 0.0877; NS).\nIt is concluded that high saphenofemoral ligation combined with multiple \"stab avulsions\" preserves an LSV with characteristics suggesting suitability for future use as a vascular prosthesis with good early symptomatic and cosmetic results.",

In addition, four duplex scanning-confirmed competent segments of greater saphenous veins (i.e., potential varicose veins [PV]) affected by varicosis at alternate sites were analyzed. Proteolytic activity was determined by zymography and radiolabeled substrate assay.\nThe content of collagen was significantly increased in the VV and PV compared with NV (VV = 189 +/- 7 mg/gm, PV = 189 +/- 9 mg/gm vs NV = 144 +/- 10 mg/gm, p < 0.05). Conversely, the elastin content in the VV and PV was significantly reduced (VV = 53 +/- 3 mg/gm, PV = 50 +/- 4 mg/gm vs NV = 74 +/- 4 mg/gm, p < 0.05). The collagen to elastin ratio demonstrated an alteration in VV and PV compared with NV (VV = 3.7 +/- 0.3, PV = 3.9 +/- 0.4 vs NV = 2.0 +/- 0.2, p < 0.05). Casein and gelatin zymography did not demonstrate significant qualitative differences in the enzymatic activities among the three groups. Quantitative analysis of the elastase activity in the venous tissues was similarly not appreciably altered (VV = 5.1 +/- 0.2 U/gm, PV = 5.3 +/- 0.2 U/gm vs NV = 5.7 +/- 0.3 U/gm).\nA significant increase in the collagen content and a significant reduction in the elastin content of VV were demonstrated. The net increase in the collagen/elastin ratio is indicative of an imbalance in the connective tissue matrix. The biochemical profile of PV was similar to VV and significantly different from NV. These preliminary data support the presence of connective tissue abnormalities before valvular insufficiency. In addition, the absence of an increase in the proteolytic activity excludes enzymatic matrix degradation as an essential component in the formation of venous varicosities.",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasonography with distal cuff deflation was used to determine the presence and size of incompetent veins and compare the results with those of air plethysmography in patients with chronic venous insufficiency.\nThirty-two legs underwent a detailed study with both modalities. Sixteen legs had venous ulceration, six had stasis dermatitis, and ten had symptomatic varicose veins without skin changes.\nAlthough the venous filling index (VFI) in limbs with ulcers (5.4 +/- 3.8 ml/sec) and dermatitis (7.7 +/- 4.6 ml/sec) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than it was in limbs with varicose veins (2.6 +/- 1.7 ml/sec), there was a large amount of overlap. Only 13% of ulcerated legs had VFI greater than 10 ml/sec. Sixty-three percent of legs with ulcers, 33% of legs with dermatitis, and 90% of legs with varicose veins had VFIs less than 5 ml/sec. Mean ejection fractions (EFs) in the three groups were similar, ranging from 45% to 52%. Combining VFI and EF did not lessen the overlap between groups. Forty-one percent of limbs with ulcers or dermatitis had air plethysmography parameters in the normal or intermediate area (VFI < 5 ml/sec; EF > 40%), which in previous studies corresponded to an incidence of ulceration of only 2%. VFI had a significant but weak correlation (r = 0.39) with the diameter of incompetent veins at the knee and a somewhat stronger relationship (r = 0.55) with the diameter of lower leg veins. Total venous volume correlated moderately well with calf vein diameter (r = 0.75). The clinical status of the leg did not correlate with the diameters of incompetent veins at the knee or calf levels. All limbs with an obstructed outflow had EFs less than 60% and ulcers or dermatitis.\nWe conclude that plethysmographic measurements of functional venous parameters (VFI,EF) do not discriminate well between limbs with uncomplicated varicose veins and limbs with ulcers or stasis dermatitis and that VFI correlates poorly with the presence of incompetent veins and their diameters. Both duplex scanning and plethysmography seem to be necessary for a complete evaluation of limbs with chronic venous insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesized that the clinical benefit of elastic compression stockings (ECS) is at least in part due to an increase in subcutaneous pressure that may promote resorption of extracellular fluids, providing more efficient diffusion of oxygen and nutrients from the microcirculation to the skin and subcutaneous tissues.\nTo test this hypothesis we designed and standardized a device for measuring subcutaneous pressure in patients. We then measured the supine perimalleolar subcutaneous pressure from a single limb in four groups: group 1 consisted of control subjects (n = 8); group 2 consisted of patients with varicose veins and superficial venous insufficiency without lipodermatosclerosis or edema (n = 5); group 3 consisted of patients with deep venous insufficiency and lipodermatosclerosis but without edema (n = 8); and group 4 consisted of patients with deep venous insufficiency, lipodermatosclerosis, and clinically evident edema (n = 8). Measurements were made at baseline and after application of 20 to 30 mm Hg and 30 to 40 mm Hg ECS.\nThere was no significant difference in the baseline subcutaneous pressure between the three groups without clinical edema (p > 0.05). Baseline perimalleolar pressure was elevated, however, in group 4 patients compared with groups 1, 2, and 3 (p < 0.05). All three groups with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) (groups 2, 3, 4) demonstrated increases in subcutaneous pressure with application of ECS, which was statistically significant in groups 3 and 4. There was no difference between the increase in perimalleolar subcutaneous pressure induced by 20 to 30 mm Hg or 30 to 40 mm Hg ECS in groups 3 and 4.\nPatients with CVI and edema have significant elevations in supine resting perimalleolar subcutaneous pressure compared with control subjects and patients with CVI without edema. Twenty to 30 mm Hg and 30 to 40 mm Hg ECS increased measured perimalleolar subcutaneous pressure in patients with CVI with and without clinical edema but not in control patients. These results suggest the mechanism of benefit of ECS in patients with CVI is due at least in part to an increase in subcutaneous pressure that may act to promote more efficient absorption of perimalleolar extracellular fluid.",

    "abstract": "Lymphoscintigraphy has emerged as the diagnostic test of choice in patients with suspected lymphedema. To assess the lymphatic circulation of 386 extremities in 188 patients, we prospectively recorded a semiquantitative index of lymphatic transport in addition to visual evaluation of lymphoscintigraphy image patterns.\nSixty-one male and 127 female patients were studied (mean age 48 years, range 13 to 87 years). Twenty had upper extremity swelling, and 168 had lower extremity swelling. The disease was bilateral in 60 patients. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed by injecting a mean of 503 microCi of technetium 99m-antimony trisulfide colloid subcutaneously into the second interdigital space of the extremity. Time for transport to regional lymph nodes, appearance of lymph vessels and nodes and distribution pattern were scored. These scores were compiled into a modified Kleinhans transport index (TI). To assess the venous circulation, 155 patients underwent evaluation of the venous system by impedance plethysmography, ultrasonography, or contrast venography.\nThe mean TI (+/- SEM) in 79 asymptomatic extremities was 2.6 +/- 0.5, with 66 (83.5%) demonstrating normal lymphoscintigraphy pattern (TI < 5). Patients with clinical diagnosis of lymphedema (n = 124) had a mean TI of 23.8 +/- 1.5; 81.5% of these were greater than 5. Fifty-six patients (30%) had primary and 68 (36%) had secondary lymphedema. (TI of 26 +/- 3.5 and 22.1 +/- 1.9, respectively, p = NS). Patients without any lymphatic transport (TI of 45) were more likely to have cellulitis in their history (p < 0.05). Contrast lymphangiography in six patients correlated with lymphoscintigraphy. Sixty-four patients (34%) had swelling without lymphedema (venous edema, cardiac edema, lipedema, etc.; TI of 1.9 +/- 0.4, p < 0.001). Of the 41 patients with abnormal venous studies, 18 (44%) had an elevated TI.\nSemiquantitative evaluation of the lymphatic transport with lymphoscintigraphy reliably depicts abnormalities in the lymphatic circulation. Lymphoscintigraphy excluded lymphedema as a cause of leg swelling in one third of our patients.",

    "abstract": "The clinical diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is unreliable. Contrast phlebography (CP) continues to be the gold standard, but it is invasive. Although duplex ultrasonography is an accurate, noninvasive alternative, it is expensive, technically demanding, and time-consuming. We postulated that light reflection rheography (LRR), a noninvasive method of assessing the quantity and rate of venous emptying, might be a reliable and inexpensive bedside approach to screening patients with clinically suspected DVT.\nWith LRR, infrared light is beamed onto the skin, and the amount of backscattered rays are detected, which indirectly measures the amount of blood present in a volume of the epidermis beneath the LRR probe. Applied to the calf muscle pump, LRR can provide a noninvasive method of assessing blood volume changes in the sample area of skin, in response to venous hemodynamic changes in the lower limb.\nSixty-nine limbs in 61 patients undergoing CP for clinically suspected DVT over a period of 12 months also underwent LRR, either just before or within 24 hours of undergoing phlebography. The criteria for diagnosing DVT on CP were presence of filling defect or nonfilling of a venous segment. The result of LRR was considered positive for DVT if the rate of venous emptying was 0.35 or less. With these criteria a sensitivity of 96.4% and specificity of 82.9 were obtained. This resulted in a positive predictive value of 79% and a negative predictive value of 97.1%.\nLRR is a simple, inexpensive, and noninvasive bedside test that takes 10 minutes to perform. It is highly sensitive with a high negative predictive value, detecting most cases of DVT, reliably ruling out DVT, and eliminating the need for more time-consuming and costly studies. Therefore it seems to be an appropriate screening test in patients with clinically suspected DVT.",

    "abstract": "This report describes popliteal vein entrapment in three patients and demonstrates that it may present with manifestations of typical venous disease.\nThis report was compiled from a review of inpatient and outpatient records.\nIn the first case, a 28-year-old woman was seen with left leg popliteal and calf deep vein thrombosis without obvious cause. She described long-standing calf discomfort, and passive dorsiflexion of the left foot caused disappearance of arterial pulsations at the pedal level. She was given the anticoagulants heparin and sodium warfarin (Coumadin) followed by surgical exploration. The popliteal vein and artery were entrapped by a fibrous extension of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle attaching to the lateral femoral condyle. After band lysis, the patient has been symptom free for 6 years. The second patient, a 37-year-old man, was seen with bilateral chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Passive dorsiflexion and active plantar flexion of the feet did not diminish the pedal pulses; impedance plethysmography suggested mild outflow obstruction. Ascending venography demonstrated entrapment at the midportion of duplicated popliteal veins with no postthrombotic changes. He was treated with compression stockings and has done well during an 18-month follow-up. The third patient, a 17-year-old male, was seen with severe symptoms of right leg CVI and venous obstruction since 3 years of age. Air plethysmography revealed ambulatory venous hypertension, whereas venography demonstrated reflux down to the knee with an extrinsic narrowing at the midpopliteal vein. During operation, an abnormal origin of the lesser saphenous vein (LSV) from the popliteal vein was found; the LSV took a medial route, compressed the tibial nerve, and caused severe distortion and narrowing of the popliteal vein. Division of the LSV resulted in release of popliteal venous compression and immediate relief of symptoms.\nThe three cases presented demonstrate that popliteal venous entrapment may begin with symptoms of deep vein thrombosis and CVI. Popliteal venous entrapment must be considered in the differential diagnosis of venous disease in younger patients in whom common predisposing factors are absent.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of deep venous thrombosis increases significantly with age. Attempts to explain this association have failed to identify factors that could be contributory. We hypothesized that age-related changes in venous physiologic parameters might contribute to an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis.\nAir plethysmography was used to measure a number of physiologic parameters in two sets of patients. Group A consisted of 17 subjects (33 limbs), age range 23 to 40 years. Group B consisted of 11 subjects (22 limbs), age range 60 to 83 years. No subject in either group had peripheral vascular disease or a history of deep venous thrombosis. Parameters measured were venous volume, venous filling index, ejection volume, ejection fraction, residual volume fraction, and outflow fraction.\nVenous volume and ejection fraction were significantly reduced in Group B compared with Group A. Residual volume fraction was significantly increased in Group B compared with Group A. There were no statistically significant differences in outflow fraction, venous filling index, or ejection fraction between the two groups.\nThese results suggest that the efficiency of the calf muscle pump diminishes with increasing age, possibly contributing to the increased incidence of deep venous thrombosis in the elderly.",

    "abstract": "Color-flow and duplex ultrasonography were used to determine the optimal method for documenting venous valvular reflux. Popliteal veins were examined in 10 normal limbs and 11 limbs with clinical evidence of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Peak reflux velocity (spectral) and duration of reflux (spectral and color) were measured with the patient in supine and standing positions, with manual and pneumatic compression applied sequentially to thigh and calf. Manual and pneumatic compression produced equivalent reflux velocity and duration. In normal limbs peak reflux velocity was always less than 22 cm/sec, with a mean reverse flow duration of 0.3 sec +/- 0.03 (SEM). In limbs with CVI, reflux velocity varied widely among protocols. Reflux duration and velocity were greater in the supine position than in the standing position for both normal limbs and limbs with CVI (p < 0.04). Duration was significantly increased for thigh versus calf compression in normal limbs (p < 0.001) but decreased in limbs with CVI (p < 0.003). Methods that used thigh compression or supine position were less capable of discriminating normal limbs from limbs with CVI. Standing calf compression provided the greatest rates of sensitivity (91%), specificity (100%), and accuracy (95%). Compared with spectral Doppler scanning, color-flow ultrasonography produced a consistently shorter reflux duration (p < 0.001). In limbs with CVI with a mean spectral duration of 2.5 sec +/- 0.2 (SEM), mean color Doppler duration was 0.7 sec shorter. Our results demonstrate that popliteal vein incompetence is identified optimally by reflux duration after standing calf compression; adequate manual compression is sufficient to identify reflux; color-flow Doppler ultrasonography may underestimate reflux duration.",

    "abstract": "Contrast venography is the gold standard for diagnosis in deep venous thrombosis (DVT); however, this technique is invasive and requires the use of potentially hazardous contrast agents. Although duplex Doppler ultrasonography is accurate in the evaluation of lower extremity DVT, it is less accurate in the assessment of the pelvic and intraabdominal veins. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) has recently been developed, and our purpose was to determine whether MRV could accurately demonstrated DVT when compared with duplex scanning and contrast venography.\nEighty-five patients underwent contrast venography and MRV from the inferior vena cava to the popliteal veins to rule out DVT. Thirty-three of these patients also underwent duplex scanning. Blinded readings of these studies were compared for the presence or absence and extent of venous thrombosis.\nDVT was documented by contrast venography in 27 (27%) venous systems. Results of MRV and contrast venography were identical in 98 (97%) of 101 venous systems, whereas results of duplex scanning and contrast venography were identical in 40 (98%) of 41 venous systems. All DVTs identified by contrast venography were detected by MRV and duplex scanning. The discrepancies were due to false-positive MRV (3) and duplex scanning (1) results. When compared with contrast venography, MRV had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 96%, positive predictive value of 90%, and negative predictive value of 100%. For duplex scanning the sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 96%, positive predictive value was 94%, and negative predictive value was 100%.\nIt is concluded that MRV is an accurate noninvasive venographic technique for the detection of DVT.",

The tissue was stained with the avidin-biotin complex with the following primary antibodies: anti-ICAM-1-AA6, anti-E-selectin-BB11, and anti-VCAM-1-4B9. The slides were assigned an inflammatory score of 0 to 3, and the percentage of each cell type staining, 0% to 100%.\nA trend towards a higher inflammatory score was found in the vessel wall in AAA (2.4 +/- 1.8) as compared with AOD (1 +/- 0.37) or NL (0.2 +/- 0.2). There was no statistical difference. A significant elevation in ICAM-1 expression (p < or = 0.06), however, was demonstrated in the adventitial endothelial cells of AAA (85.8% +/- 7.8%), and AOD (80.0% +/- 11.1%), as compared with NL (30.8% +/- 12.2%). Both E-selectin and VCAM-1 were expressed in all groups, but no statistical difference was demonstrated.\nPatients with AAA and AOD display a significant upregulation of the expression of ICAM-1, suggesting a role for this protein in the initiation or maintenance of degenerative aortic diseases.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to review the 91 failing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts that were treated at our institution over the past 12 years to better understand their cause and improve the diagnosis and treatment of these grafts.\nEighty-five patients with 91 failing grafts were retrospectively reviewed. The 144 graft-threatening lesions associated with these grafts were characterized by location (inflow artery, outflow artery, anastomosis, or graft body) and treatment method used (surgery, balloon angioplasty, or thrombolysis).\nProgression of atherosclerotic disease was the predominant cause of failing PTFE grafts with 43 inflow lesions and 83 outflow lesions, accounting for 87% of all lesions identified. Ten lesions (7%) were noted within the prosthetic grafts, whereas only eight (6%) lesions were noted at the anastomoses. Forty stenotic lesions 2 cm in length or less were treated with percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty, whereas 100 lesions were treated by patch angioplasty or graft extensions. The remaining four lesions, present within the prosthetic grafts, were treated with thrombolytic therapy. The 5-year cumulative patency rate for all failing PTFE grafts was 71%, whereas that of failing femoropopliteal PTFE grafts was 64%. The 5-year limb salvage rate for all failing PTFE grafts was 73%.\nThe progression of inflow and outflow disease is the predominant cause of failing PTFE grafts, which suggests that this process is a more important cause of PTFE graft thrombosis than is generally recognized. Frequent PTFE graft surveillance may permit detection of some threatening lesions before graft thrombosis occurs and may help maintain and prolong graft patency. The enhanced 5-year patency and limb salvage rates for treated failing PTFE grafts compared with the known poor outcome after reinterventions for PTFE graft failure support the conclusion that surveillance of PTFE grafts is worthwhile.",

Ten soft-tissue reconstruction were performed at the time of the vascular reconstruction and 10 were delayed. Free-tissue transferred included muscle, fasciocutaneous flaps, and omentum. Inflow to the flap was from the bypass graft (n = 12) or the distal tibial artery.\nOne free flap and graft failed immediately in the same patient. One successful flap and graft required a below-knee amputation for ongoing infection in the surrounding soft tissues. Eighteen of 20 patients have had free-flap and graft patency during the mean follow-up period of 17 months (range 6 to 33 months).

The group includes 21 women and 17 men with a mean age of 69 +/- 11 years. Mean follow-up is 8.2 +/- 5.5 months. Logistic regression was used to analyze five variables in an attempt to identify predictors of success or failure: distal anastomosis to the popliteal artery versus a crural artery, one-vessel versus two- or three-vessel runoff, postoperative anticoagulation versus none, primary reconstructions versus reoperations, and one segment versus two segments of CSVA required.\nThe cumulative patency rate at 12 months by life-table analysis is 66%. Logistic regression revealed that primary reconstructions were more likely to succeed than reoperations (p = 0.03) and operations completed with one segment of CSVA were more likely to succeed than those requiring more than one segment of vein (p = 0.03).\nWe conclude that (1) the short-term patency of infrainguinal bypasses with CSVA suggests that they may be acceptable alternatives to prosthetic grafts in the below-knee position, and (2) primary reconstructions performed with one segment of CSVA are more likely to succeed.",

We developed an experimental rat aortic allograft aneurysm model in which segments of infrarenal aorta were transplanted between hypertensive and normotensive rats to study these factors in this model.\nAortic allografts and autografts were inserted into spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. Effects of immunologic and antihypertensive therapy were evaluated. Graft diameters were followed up with magnetic resonance imaging and at harvest. Direct-pressure measurements were taken and dp/dtmax (force of ventricular contractions) was calculated before harvest.\nAutografts remained isodiametric and maintained their histologic architecture. Aneurysmal dilation of transplanted segments occurred in SHR host allografts but not in WKY host allografts. Histologic examination of all allograft specimens noted a rejection reaction characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and medial smooth muscle cell loss. Antigenic enhancement accelerated aneurysm development in SHR hosts but had no significant effect on WKY hosts. Rates of allograft enlargement and final allograft diameters were similar in antihypertensive treated and untreated SHR hosts. The dp/dtmax in untreated SHR hosts was greatest and differed significantly from that in the WKY rats but only marginally from that in treated SHR hosts.\nImmunologic rejection but not abnormal hemodynamics is necessary for development of allograft aneurysm in this model.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells is an important step in the process of intimal hyperplasia. Veins exposed to arterial pressure develop intimal hyperplastic lesions that lead to failure of vein bypasses. Insulin-like growth factor-I is a polypeptide hormone structurally related to insulin with insulin-like metabolic effects. Insulin-like growth factor-I has been found to work in concert with other growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor, to promote the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells in culture. Insulin-like growth factor-I exerts its effects via specific receptors located on the cell surface. We studied the in situ distribution of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor binding using autoradiography and examined insulin-like growth factor-I binding characteristics in normal human greater saphenous vein.\nFrozen sections 20 microns thick were prepared from the greater saphenous vein specimens. The sections were incubated in a buffer containing 125I-insulin-like growth factor-I in the presence of increasing concentrations of the unlabeled peptide. Autoradiograms were obtained by apposing the treated sections to autoradiography film.\nAnalysis of the autoradiographs showed that insulin-like growth factor-I binding was consistently present in the wall of human greater saphenous vein. To characterize these binding sites binding inhibition studies were performed. High-affinity insulin-like growth factor-I receptor binding was found with dissociation constant of 1.0 +/- 0.32 nmol/L and maximum binding capacity of 0.46 +/- 0.23 pmol/mg protein. These values are consistent with a physiologic role for insulin-like growth factor-I in the tissue examined.\nThe presence of high-affinity (dissociation constant = 1.0 +/- 0.32) insulin-like growth factor-I binding sites in the wall of saphenous vein suggests that insulin-like growth factor-I plays an important role in regulating the proliferation of venous wall cellular components, an essential step in the process of venous intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Vascular procedures reoxygenate ischemic endothelial cells (EC) and arterialize saphenous vein (HSV) EC. The balance between the EC-derived fibrinolytic components, plasminogen activator (tPA), and plasminogen inhibitor (PAI-1) contributes to maintaining thromboresistance. This balance also affects proteolysis through plasmin generation, mediating matrix metabolism endothelial migration, angiogenesis, and theoretically affecting the development of intimal hyperplasia.\nTo explore the impact of varying oxygen tensions on EC fibrinolysis, HSV and human umbilical vein (HUV) were subjected to Po2 of 40 mm Hg for 24 hours with restoration of Po2 to 150 mm Hg for 24 hours. The tPA and PAI-1 antigen and tPA/PAI-1 antigen ratio in conditioned media (CM), expressed as increases or decreases % change, normalized for cell count, versus controls, were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cellular tPA and PAI-1 mRNAs were assessed by Northern analysis.\nThe tPA but not PAI-1 was significantly decreased after the first 24 hours in HSVEC and significantly decreased after 48 hours in both HUVEC and HSVEC when compared with controls. Messenger RNA for tPA was unchanged but PAI-1 mRNA increased significantly for HSVEC and HUVEC after 24 hours of Po2 of 40 mm Hg, returning to baseline within 24 hours of Po2 to 150 mm Hg restoration.\nThese data support the hypothesis of a fibrinolytic shift after altered ambient O2 tensions exposure in endothelium and demonstrate that HSVEC are more sensitive to altered O2 tension than HUVEC. Altered O2 tensions depress EC fibrinolysis in this model.",

Deficiency of protein S has been associated with recurrent thrombotic events. To characterize better the risks of thrombosis in protein S deficiency, we studied 62 members in a large kindred.\nAll members were evaluated by a thorough clinical history. Plasma samples were assayed for total protein S antigen and protein S activity. Upper and lower extremity venous duplex examinations were performed in the majority of adult members.\nTwenty-six (40%) of the 62 family members were classified as deficient on the basis of either low total protein S antigen levels or low protein S functional activity. Five members deficient in protein S had 16 venous thrombotic events. In all members the onset of thrombotic events occurred after 19 years of age, with a tendency for recurrence. Three lower extremity deep venous thromboses that had been occult previously were first diagnosed on surveillance duplex scanning. Only one member whose protein S level was not deficient had a single episode of superficial thrombophlebitis.\nOur findings in this large kindred confirm an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern. Thrombotic events occurred after the age of 19 years in affected individuals and tended to be recurrent. The diagnosis of protein S deficiency is based on functional and immunologic plasma assays.

    "abstract": "A study of technical feasibility was undertaken to determine whether angioscopy and parallel endovascular instrumentation could effectively evaluate and restore inflow into occluded suprainguinal grafts.\nSeveral endobronchial instruments were selected for adaptation for use in clearing occluded grafts under angioscopic guidance. These instruments were used in the treatment of 12 thrombosed grafts limbs in 10 patients who were admitted 1 to 40 days after occlusion. The occluded suprainguinal graft limbs were exposed just proximal to the femoral anastomosis. Blind retrograde balloon thrombectomy and clot extraction were performed. Graft limbs underwent angioscopy, and the presence of luminal defects were recorded. Endoluminal instruments were then inserted parallel to the angioscope, and luminal defects were corrected. After inflow was reestablished, the distal portion of the graft was thrombectomized, and any necessary distal revisions were performed.\nBlind retrograde thrombectomy was successful in restoring inflow deemed normal in (67%) eight of 12 graft limbs and present but diminished in two (17%) graft limbs. Balloon thrombectomy was ineffective in restoring graft flow in two (17%) graft limbs. Angioscopy revealed luminal defects in 10 (83%) graft limbs after blind retrograde thrombectomy. Only 2 (17%) graft limbs had no luminal defects after thrombectomy. Findings included pseudointimal flap in eight of 12 (67%), adherent residual thrombus in 4 (33%), and kinked graft limbs in 2 (17%) graft limbs. Endovascular instrumentation was successful in resecting all luminal disease under angioscopic guidance. There were no deaths, no episodes of graft injury or distal embolization, and only one groin hematoma. During a mean follow-up period of 6 months (2 to 13 months), there was one late reocclusion at 7 months.\nWe conclude that angioscopically guided thrombectomy and endovascular graft revision is a useful approach to the treatment of the occluded suprainguinal graft. Enhanced luminal visualization permits refined diagnostic assessment and definitive therapy. This may prolong the benefit of suprainguinal reconstructions.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to retrospectively identify risk factors for postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic surgery via a midline incision.\nWe reviewed 181 consecutive patients who underwent operation between July 1986 to December 1992. Preoperative factors analyzed included age, sex, diabetes mellitus, history of smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, indication for surgery (aneurysm [126] or aortoiliac occlusive disease [AIOD] [55]), history of coronary artery disease, length of preoperative hospital stay, American Society of Anaesthesiologists class, and pulmonary function tests. Intraoperative factors analyzed included endotracheal tube diameter, percent of inspired oxygen, blood loss, blood and crystalloid replacement, total operative time, epidural analgesia, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.\nAlthough the operative mortality rate was only 1.7% (3 of 181), major pulmonary complications occurred in 29 (16%) patients, including two lung-related deaths. Pneumonia occurred in 17 (9%) patients, prolonged intubation greater than 24 hours occurred in nine (5%), and reintubation caused by pulmonary insufficiency occurred in three (2%). On univariate analysis, the following were associated with major pulmonary complications (p < 00.05): American Society of Anaesthesiologists class IV, age greater than 70 years, ideal body weight greater than 150%, forced vital capacity of 80% or less predicted, forced expiratory flow rate (25 to 75) of 60% or less predicted, crystalloid replacement greater than 6 L, and total operative time greater than 5 hours.\nThe presence of these pulmonary risk factors, notably increased age and weight, decreased forced vital capacity and forced expiratory flow rate (25 to 75), and expected prolonged operative time, influences our decision not to proceed with surgery for small aortic aneurysms or for AIOD causing claudication. Patients at high pulmonary risk with AIOD who require revascularization for limb salvage would be more likely to undergo extraanatomic bypass. Pulmonary risk factors may play as important a role as cardiac factors in elective aortic surgery.",

Patients were placed into three groups. Group I (n = 31) had normal DSEs. Group II (n = 25) had resting wall motion abnormalities without dobutamine-induced changes of ischemia. Group III (n = 25) had evidence of dobutamine-induced ischemia. Patient analysis revealed that of 46 patients with clinical indicators of coronary artery disease (CAD), only 23 had DSEs with inducible ischemia. Two of 35 patients without clinical indicators of CAD had DSEs with inducible ischemia.\nThe 56 patients in group I and II underwent aortic reconstruction without cardiac complications or death. Of the 25 patients in group III, surgery was deferred in five (two patients with claudication and three with aneurysms < or = 5 cm), and four underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. Outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting included one death from stroke, one aneurysm rupture, and two uncomplicated aortic reconstructions. The remaining 16 patients in group III underwent aortic surgery, with three postoperative myocardial infarctions (MI) and no deaths.\nUsing DSE for preoperative assessment of cardiac risk allowed us to operate on 74 of 81 patients being considered for elective aortic reconstruction, with no operative deaths and a 4.1% rate of perioperative MI. Dobutamine stress echocardiography has the ability to identify patients with asymptomatic stress-induced ischemic myocardium and its increased risk for perioperative MI (p < 0.001). Equally important, for patients with clinical indicators of CAD but without DSE-inducible ischemia, no further cardiac evaluation is necessary.",

Affected patients usually present with unilateral leg edema. The condition is most often seen in women, in whom it may also be a cause of vulvar varicosities. Presented here is a case of idiopathic iliac vein obstruction associated with an ipsilateral varicocele in a young man. This varicocele was caused by multiple collateral venous channels and was resistant to surgical high ligation. This case illustrates an unusual cause of varicocele formation and an anatomic reason for failure of standard surgical therapy.",

Treatment of these patients can be more complicated than treatment of trauma in adults and must include maintenance of symmetric limb growth, compensatory growth of the vascular graft and its anastomoses, and the need for very long-term graft patency. This report describes the care of a 5-year-old child who was impaled by a hot metal pipe and sustained a penetrating thermal injury to the distal external iliac artery and vein.

    "abstract": "Intravascular ultrasonography, balloon angioplasty, stent placement, and endovascular septal fenestration have been used in the evaluation and treatment of vascular complications of acute and chronic aortic dissection in five patients. There were three men and two women with an average age of 52 years (range 39 to 64 years). There were three chronic type A dissections, one acute type B, and one subacute type B dissection. Intravascular ultrasonography was used in all five cases. The three patients with chronic type A dissections underwent unilateral renal artery angioplasty (RA PTA) and stent placement; one patient with an acute type B dissection and associated fibromuscular dysplasia underwent bilateral RA PTA without stent placement. These procedures were performed to ameliorate severe hypertension. The final patient, with a subacute type B dissection, underwent iliac artery stenting to correct severe lower extremity ischemia. During a second intervention, this patient, who also had bowel ischemia and nonresolving acute renal failure, underwent balloon dilatation of a preexisting septal fenestration to augment visceral blood supply and bilateral RA PTA and stent placement in an effort to improve renal function. This patient eventually died of gut ischemia. After RA PTA and stent placement, one patient had a major intrarenal hemorrhage that required coil embolization and transfusion. In the four survivors, RA PTA and stent placement resulted in immediate improvement in blood pressure control. This response has been sustained during follow-up intervals ranging from 8 to 18 months (average 10 months). Intravascular ultrasonography can clearly demonstrate the pathologic anatomy associated with aortic dissection (even when angiography is ambiguous) and is essential for guiding therapeutic endovascular interventions. Further exploration of the efficacy of these endovascular techniques is warranted in this high-risk group of patients with aortic dissection who have appropriate clinical indications.",

    "abstract": "Fifty consecutive patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm resection were studied prospectively for the presence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) after surgery.\nBilateral venography was performed 5 days after surgery in all patients. There were 42 men and 8 women, with a mean age of 70 years (range 60 to 83 years). No patients received DVT prophylaxis before surgery.\nNine (18%) of 50 patients had a venogram positive for acute DVT. Nine (21%) of 42 men and none of eight women had DVT. Six patients had DVT in the left leg and three patients in the right leg. No patients had symptoms to suggest DVT. Seven (78%) of the nine patients with DVT had thrombi in the calf veins and two patients (22%) had thrombi in the more proximal venous segments, representing 14% and 4% of the entire series, respectively. No clinically evident pulmonary emboli were observed.\nEighteen percent of 50 consecutive patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm resection had DVT. Because of this high incidence, a study should be undertaken to determine whether DVT prophylaxis can lower the incidence of DVT after abdominal aortic aneurysm resection.",

    "abstract": "It is generally accepted that when necrosis extends proximal to the transmetatarsal level a viable and functional foot can no longer be preserved and a major (above- or below-knee) amputation must be performed. However, with continuing advances in operations for limb salvage we felt the need to reexamine this concept.\nIn 1983 we initiated a prospective study to evaluate the role of extended foot amputations. All ambulatory patients with necrosis extending proximal to the transmetatarsal level (but not involving the whole foot) were included in the study. Among the 21 patients studied amputations ranged from open guillotine transmetatarsal amputation to removal of the medial or lateral three fifths of the foot. Five of these patients had adequate pedal circulation by clinical and laboratory criteria. The remaining 16 required vascular reconstruction to improve pedal flow.\nEighteen (86%) of 21 patients had complete healing of the foot amputations and were ambulatory at the time of discharge from the hospital. Two patients required early above- or below-knee amputations. Three additional patients sustained limb loss in the follow-up period. The cumulative graft patency rate was 94% at 12 months. The cumulative limb salvage rate at 24 months was 84%. The operative mortality rate was 1 (5%) of 21.\nOur experience in a small number of patients suggests that functional foot salvage is possible even when necrosis or gangrene extends proximal to the transmetatarsal level.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate in vivo the long-term development, differentiation, and proliferation of the subendothelial tissue on Dacron prostheses seeded with microvascular cells (MVC).\nAutologous MVC from omental adipose tissue were seeded on 4 mm Dacron prostheses and the prostheses interposed in the carotid arteries of mongrel dogs for 5, 13, and 26 weeks.\nLight and electron microscopic evaluation of patent seeded prostheses demonstrated an almost complete monolayer of endothelial cells and well-organized subendothelial tissue, whereas patent control prostheses were mainly covered by red and white thrombi, which were partially replaced by organized tissue with increased implantation time. The measurements of the thickness of the luminal cell layer in seeded and control grafts showed no statistically significant increase between 5 and 26 weeks of implantation. The subendothelial tissue of seeded prostheses demonstrated a time-dependent maturation of highly synthesizing myofibroblasts embedded in a collagen matrix to cells with features of smooth muscle cells located in a collagen-elastin matrix. In control grafts examined after 26 weeks the spontaneous endothelialization was accompanied by a delayed or incomplete maturation of subendothelial tissue.\nOur study indicates that MVC seeded onto Dacron prostheses are able to generate a vascular wall that does not continue to proliferate after prolonged implantation and that increasingly resembles the wall of a normal artery in cell differentiation and intercellular matrix.",

    "abstract": "Revascularization of renal arteries to salvage glomerular function in patients with chronic renal failure is performed infrequently. However, during the past 12 months we have encountered three patients over 60 years of age known to have chronic renal failure who were on dialysis for 2 weeks, 3 weeks, and 2 months, respectively. All three patients were hypertensive, requiring between four and five antihypertensive medications. One patient was ventilator dependent in intractable cardiac failure with pulmonary artery systolic pressures ranging from 60 to 70 mm Hg. Standard biplanar arteriography revealed occlusion of the left renal artery with distal reconstitution in two patients and a 99% stenosis of the right renal artery in the remaining patient. The contralateral renal artery was totally occluded in two patients and diffusely stenotic in one. The recipient kidneys measured 8, 10, and 11 cm in length. Kidney function was assessed by renal scintigraphy and creatinine clearance. Two splenorenal bypasses and one hepatorenal bypass with 6 mm polytetrafluoroethylene graft were performed successfully. After surgery, renal function improved in all patients with two of three patients resuming normal function as evidenced by reduction of serum creatinine levels to 0.9 and 1.3 mg/dl. The third patient recovered to have a creatinine level of 3.2 mg/dl. All patients were discharged home within 1 month with a daily urine output greater than 1500 ml. At discharge, each patient required only two antihypertensive medications to control blood pressure. Duplex scanning 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery confirmed patency of all reconstructions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "As part of a prospective clinical trial on the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, we studied the risk factors for death in 444 male patients.\nAt entry to the trial, patients were judged to be healthy enough to be randomized to operative intervention and were judged to be free of any disease that would preclude a minimal 5-year life expectancy after randomization.\nPatients were treated with aspirin and optimal medical care and were monitored for an average of 4 years. Combined mortality rate was 37% (9% per year) for the medical group (38%) and surgical group (35%). Eight factors were identified that were significantly associated with increased mortality rates: coronary artery disease (p = 0.044), history of angina (p = 0.047), congestive heart failure (CHF) (p = 0.012), abnormal electrocardiography results at entry (p = 0.005), peripheral vascular disease (p = 0.019), claudication (p = 0.044), diabetes (p = 0.008), and history of hypertension (p = 0.044). The increase in risk indicated by the odds ratios (OR) were moderate (OR < 2.00) for each of the clinical risk factors except for CHF. Sixteen of 27 patients (59%) with a history of CHF at entry to the study died during follow-up (OR = 2.67). Arteriographic predictors of increased mortality rates included bilateral carotid artery stenosis and intracranial vascular disease (ICVD). With bilateral stenosis, 42% (80 of 190 patients) died compared with 33% (83 of 252 patients) with unilateral stenosis (p = 0.062). With ICVD, 43% (56 of 130 patients) died compared with 34% (107 of 314 patients) of those without ICVD (p = 0.073). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that three risk factors were significantly associated with an increased risk of death: diabetes, abnormal electrocardiography results, and claudication. Patients with two or three of these risk factors demonstrated annual mortality rates of 11.3% and 13%, respectively. This was significantly higher than patients with none of these risks (OR = 2.95 and OR = 4.06, respectively).\nAdult male patients with high-grade asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis demonstrate a mortality rate of 37% at a mean follow-up of 4 years. Although age was not a risk for increased mortality rates in this population, diabetes, abnormal electrocardiography results, and claudication were significant. Patients with two or three of these risk factors were at high risk of death and may require aggressive treatment of their concurrent medical diseases.",
