    "abstract": "Experiments were designed to determine whether endothelium isolated from adipose tissue and sodded onto expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts release endothelium-derived vasoactive factors.\nThin-walled expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (6 mm internal diameter, 6 cm length, 30 microm pore size), one sodded with autogenous endothelial cells, the other unsodded, were implanted bilaterally in carotid arteries of 30 male mongrel dogs. Dogs were treated with 325 mg aspirin daily. After 6 weeks grafts were excised and perfused in a bioassay system. Effluent from the grafts stimulated with either acetylcholine, thrombin, adenosine 5-diphosphate, or the calcium ionophore A23187 was superfused over rings of canine femoral arteries without endothelium contracted with phenylephrine. Effluent from the grafts was analyzed by radioimmunoassay for thromboxane B2, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha, endothelin-1, and C-type natriuretic peptide.\nNinety percent of the sodded grafts and 87% of the unsodded grafts were patent after 6 weeks. Bioassay rings superfused with effluent from sodded grafts stimulated with acetylcholine relaxed significantly more than rings superfused with effluent from similarly stimulated unsodded grafts. Biochemical analysis of the effluent showed an increase in 6-keto prostaglandin F1alpha and C-type natriuretic peptide and a decrease in endothelin-1 and thromboxane B2 release from the sodded compared with the unsodded grafts. Scanning electron microscopy showed a continuous layer of endothelial cells lining only the sodded grafts. Staining for alpha-actin and heavy-chain myosin showed a differentiated layer of smooth muscle below the endothelial layer on the sodded grafts. Finally, there was positive staining for C-type natriuretic peptide and endothelin-1 in the endothelium of the sodded grafts.\nThese results indicate that endothelial cells of sodded expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts produce endothelium-derived vasoactive factors. In addition, receptor-coupled synthesis/release of these factors is retained in sodded endothelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair has been advocated as a \"minimally invasive\" alternative to conventional aneurysm surgery. However, because of manipulation within the aneurysm sac, endovascular techniques may result in massive microembolization.\nIn this study lower limb microemboli were quantified in 29 patients undergoing conventional (11 straight and 7 bifurcated grafts) and endovascular aneurysm repair (8 aortoiliac, 1 straight, and 2 bifurcated grafts) by insonation of the superficial femoral artery with a 2 MHz Doppler probe. Emboli were detected as high-intensity, short-duration signals on the background Doppler trace. Differentiation of gaseous emboli from particulate emboli was achieved by calculation of the sample volume length (emboli velocity x duration = sample volume length) for each embolus (N = 4927). Previous experiments had determined that a sample volume length < 1.4 cm represented particulate embolization.\nThe number of gaseous, particulate, and total emboli were significantly greater in the endovascular group compared with the conventional group (p < 0.05).\nThese data demonstrate that peripheral microembolization is significantly higher during endovascular aneurysm repair than during conventional surgery. Methods to reduce embolization must be developed before endovascular aortic surgery is widely adopted.",

    "abstract": "The surgical treatment for patients with a subclavian steal is controversial, especially for patients with coexisting severe carotid stenosis. This study determines the long-term efficacy of axillo-axillary bypass grafts in patients with and without a simultaneous carotid endarterectomy.\nThe axillo-axillary bypass was done in 39 patients who were monitored for 5.8 +/- 3.9 years. Fifteen of these patients with severe carotid artery disease had a carotid endarterectomy done simultaneously. Twenty-four patients had an axillo-axillary bypass alone; four of these patients later had a carotid endarterectomy at 0.5 to 10 years. Graft patency was evaluated at intervals of 6 to 12 months by clinical evaluation and noninvasive vascular studies.\nTen-year primary and secondary patency rates for all axillo-axillary bypass grafts were 88% and 91%, respectively. When carotid endarterectomy was done with axillo-axillary bypass, these patency rates were 86% and 93%, respectively. Patients with only axillo-axillary grafts had 10-year primary and secondary patency rates of 89% and 89%, respectively. Most patients had complete relief from symptoms of arm ischemia (90%) and vertebrobasilar insufficiency (85%). No perioperative mortality or permanent neurologic deficit occurred.\nAxillo-axillary bypass is a safe and effective method for revascularization of the subclavian artery and should be considered for patients at high risk.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair with use of an aortouniiliac graft secured with self-expanding (Gianturco) stents.\nThirty patients with a median age of 72 years (age range, 52 to 86 years) and aneurysm diameter of 6.0 cm (range, 4.0 to 9.0 cm) were treated with an aortouniiliac endovascular graft. Of these 30 procedures, 28 were carried out electively and two as emergencies for leaking aneurysm. Of the 30 patients, 21 (70%) were considered to be at high risk for open surgery. A modified Gianturco stent, Dacron graft, and Wallstent were used for these procedures.\nEndovascular repair was successfully carried out in 25 of 30 (83.3%) patients. All these patients were mobile and had resumed a normal diet within 48 hours of the procedure.

    "abstract": "Elevations of plasmin have been implicated in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) because of its ability to digest extracellular matrix proteins. Plasminogen activators regulate the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is more important in modulation of fibrinolysis, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is predominant in tissue remodeling. The purpose of this study was to determine the levels of plasminogen activators in diseased aorta because they may be responsible for the increased plasmin levels previously described in AAA.\nLevels of tPA and uPA in AAA, occlusive, and normal (organ donor) aorta were studied in tissue explant supernatants. Supernatant tPA and uPA levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Northern analysis was used to quantitate uPA messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in aortic tissue.\nLevels of tPA in the supernatants were similar in occlusive (20 +/- 4 ng/ml) and AAA (23 +/- 8) aorta, but threefold higher than in normal aorta (7 +/- 5; p < 0.005 for normal vs occlusive and p < 0.001 for normal vs AAA). In contrast, uPA supernatant levels were differentially expressed, with the highest level existing in AAA (9.7 +/- 2.7 ng/ml), followed by occlusive (4.9 +/- 3.5), and the lowest levels in normal aorta (1.2 +/- 0.7; p < 0.05 for normal vs occlusive, p < 0.001 for normal vs AAA, and p < 0.005 for occlusive vs AAA). Inhibition of protein or RNA synthesis by addition of cyclohexamide or actinomycin D, respectively, revealed no significant difference between treated and control supernatants, suggesting that the increases were caused by protein release rather than active synthesis. Levels of uPA mRNA followed the same trend as the supernatant uPA levels (AAA 1.07 +/- 0.54, occlusive 0.54 +/- 0.08, and normal aorta 0.01 +/- 0.01).\nLevels of tPA were similar in aneurysmal and occlusive aorta, but exhibited a threefold increase over normal aorta, suggesting that the elevations of tPA are associated with the arteriosclerosis present in both aneurysmal and occlusive disease. Differences in uPA levels were significant between all three groups, with the highest levels in AAA and the lowest levels in normal specimens. Northern analysis of uPA mRNA followed the same trend, suggesting that the increase in uPA may be regulated at the level of transcription. As uPA plays an important role in tissue remodeling, our findings may also reflect the relative tissue repair activities in these three types of specimens and may explain the previously reported increased levels of plasmin seen in AAA.",

    "abstract": "It is reported that 25% to 50% of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) have severe coronary artery disease (CAD) and should undergo an aggressive cardiac workup before AAA repair. In contrast, it has been our policy that patients referred for AAA repairs undergo no cardiac testing before surgery.\nThis report reviews the last 113 consecutive patients who underwent elective AAA repair by the senior author using this policy. Seventy-four patients (group A) had only an electrocardiogram before surgery. The remaining 39 patients (group B) were referred having already had additional testing that included a thallium stress test (n = 20), echocardiogram (n = 18), multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scan (n = 3), cardiac catheterization (n = 8), or some combination of these.\nThere was no statistical difference between group A and group B with regard to age, sex, tobacco use or history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke (CVA), hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Group B more commonly had a history of myocardial infarction (41% vs 19%, p < 0.03) and congestive heart failure (23% vs 7%, p < 0.03). During surgery there was no significant differences in blood loss, transfusion requirements, or operative times. There were no myocardial infarctions in group A and two (5.1%) in group B, which was not significantly different. Other complications, such as CVA, renal failure, pulmonary failure, pneumonia, wound infection, and hemorrhage, were not significantly different between the two groups. Postoperative hospital stay was not significantly different. There were three deaths in the entire series (2.7%), and only one in group B was cardiac-related in a patient with known end-stage cardiac disease and a symptomatic 8 cm AAA.\nThese data indicate that most patients with AAA can safely undergo repair with no cardiac workup and that cardiac workup before AAA repair contributes little information that impacts on treatment or final clinical outcome. We conclude that cardiac testing in preparation for AAA repair is not usually necessary and that intraoperative hemodynamic management may be the most important variable in determining outcome.",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiographic (MRA) studies are the principal noninvasive methods for evaluation of extracranial occlusive disease in patients at risk for stroke, but each has limited ability to diagnose aortic arch and arch vessel disease. Recent favorable reports of the nonnephrotoxic contrast agent Gadolinium (Gd) being used to enhance MRA images of the abdominal aorta prompted us to examine its utility for the aortic arch vessels. Prospectively, 28 patients with suspected carotid or arch vessel disease were imaged by contrast arteriographic examination and MRA + Gd of the aortic arch within 30 days of each other. One (for contrast arteriograms) or two (for MRA) blinded readers measured stenoses with the contrast arteriograms as the standard. A total of 196 arch vessels containing 58 stenoses and four occlusions (by arteriogram) were examined with each method. Interobserver agreement for interpretation of MRA studies was substantial (kappa = 0.68). MRA detected all anatomic anomalies (e.g., bovine arch). The correlation of MRA with arteriographic scans for arch vessel stenoses > 50% was sensitivity, 73% (readers 1 and 2); specificity, 98% (reader 1), 89% (reader 2); positive predictive value, 73% (reader 1), 89% (reader 2); negative predictive value, 98% (readers 1 and 2); accuracy, 97% (reader 1), 98% (reader 2). MRA + Gd is an accurate new noninvasive imaging method for detection of significant aortic arch disease. In its current state of development, however, it cannot obviate the need for contrast arteriographic examination.",

The purpose of this study was to assess whether a platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, c7E3, would inhibit platelet aggregation in the presence of HAAb. If aggregation is inhibited by c7E3, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) would be done to determine whether c7E3 interfered with the binding of heparin and the HAAb.\nHAAb-positive plasmas from 21 patients (determined by platelet aggregation assays) were studied. Normal donor platelet-rich plasmas (PRP) were incubated (1 minute) with either saline solution or 3 microg/ml of c7E3. Platelet-poor plasma from patients with HAAb and one of three sources of heparin (25 microl, 10 U/ml; porcine heparin, bovine heparin, and low molecular weight heparin [enoxaparin]) were added to the PRP mixture. Aggregation was determined using a platelet aggregometer by measuring time to aggregation, the slope of the aggregation curve, and the percent change in optical density.\nPlatelet aggregation occured in 100%, 100%, and 95% of the saline solution incubations exposed to porcine heparin, bovine heparin, and enoxaparin, respectively. Incubation with c7E3 caused 100% inhibition of platelet aggregation in plasma exposed to porcine heparin, bovine heparin, and enoxaparin. The optical density curves obtained from the ELISA, which were dependent on the binding of HAAb to heparin, were not significantly different when c7E3 was compared to buffer alone.\nThe GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, c7E3, inhibits HAAb-induced platelet aggregation via a mechanism that does not appear to interfere with the binding between heparin and HAAb. Clinical trials are warranted to assess whether GP IIb/IIIa antagonists may allow patients with HAAb to safely receive heparin.",

    "abstract": "Previous reports demonstrate initial technical success with transluminally placed endovascular grafts (TPEG) for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. However, long-term changes in the size of the aorta and aneurysmal segments are unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine aortic dimensions at several levels by computed tomographic (CT) scans 1 year after TPEG.\nThirty-four patients underwent TPEG with 1-year CT scans. Patients were divided into three groups: group I, no perigraft leak; group II, early perigraft leak that sealed during the first year; and group III, persistent perigraft leak. Aortic minor and major diameters, perimeter, and area were measured at four locations: the celiac aorta, proximal neck, maximal aneurysm size, and distal neck.\nThere were 32 men and two women, with a mean age of 73 +/- 8 years. In group I there were 20 patients (58%), and groups II and III had seven patients (21%) each. The overall mean aneurysm minor diameter decreased from 4.79 +/- 0.68 cm at implantation to 4.39 +/- 0.86 cm at 1 year (p < 0.0001). The aneurysm sac decreased by 0.63 +/- 0.58 cm in group I, and by 0.34 +/- 0.24 cm in group II. In group III, however, the aneurysm sac increased by 0.19 +/- 0.21 cm. Aneurysm size change did not correlate with inferior mesenteric or lumbar artery patency. The dimensions of the celiac aorta and proximal neck did not change significantly. However, diameter of the distal neck enlarged by 0.12 +/- 0.27 cm (p < 0.01).\nTPEG exclusion is associated with reduction of aneurysm size 1 year after implantation. Expansion of the aneurysms occurred with persistent perigraft leak. The aortic size at the celiac artery and proximal neck did not change. Dilation of the distal neck was minor but requires further long-term follow-up to determine clinical significance.",

    "abstract": "Prosthetic infection after aortic reconstructive surgery historically has been treated with extraanatomical bypass, graft excision, and aortic stump closure, but at the cost of substantial mortality and amputation rates. Alternatives to this strategy include in situ prosthetic replacement in the infected area, as well as autogenous reconstructions. Inherent to all of these procedures, however, is either the creation of an aortic stump, which carries a significant risk of subsequent blowout, or the placement of a bypass conduit in the infected field, thereby maintaining the potential for subsequent infectious complications. To avoid such problems, we have used retroperitoneal in-line aortic bypass with polytetrafluoroethylene through dean tissue planes.\nSince 1987 we have treated 16 graft infections in this manner. The surgical approach consisted of obtaining retroperitoneal proximal aortic control outside of the infected field (above or below the renal arteries), followed by infrarenal division and oversewing of the distal aorta. A polytetrafluoroethylene bifurcated graft was then sewn to the proximal aorta and tunnelled through the psoas sheath laterally to the profunda femoris artery on the ipsilateral side and via the space of Retzius to the contralateral appropriate femoral vessel, so as to avoid any contact with the infected areas. After the closure of the wounds, a plastic barrier was placed over all incisions and the patient was placed supine. The old infected graft was removed transperitoneally. Extensive cultures were taken at various sites to demonstrate no cross-contamination.\nAll patients were followed-up clinically and with tagged white cell scans at 6-month intervals. There were no immediate postoperative deaths and no amputations. One patient had a myocardial infarction and died at 5 months, and a second patient died at 2 months. Of the remaining 14 patients, none had recurrent sepsis and all have had negative Indium-labeled white cell scans in follow-up. Eleven (78%) are still alive, with a mean follow-up of 32 months (range, 20 to 106 months).\nIn-line aortic bypass for treatment of aortic graft infections yields excellent results and has become our treatment of choice in dealing with this difficult problem.",

    "abstract": "The North American Subfascial Endoscopic Perforator Surgery (NASEPS) Registry was established to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of minimally invasive endoscopic Linton operations for treatment of chronic venous insufficiency.\nRetrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 151 patients who underwent attempt at 158 SEPS in 17 medical centers in the United States and Canada between June 1993 and February 1996.\nSEPS was completed on 155 limbs of 148 patients, 81 male and 67 female (mean age, 56 years; range, 27 to 87 years). Three procedures were aborted. Seven patients had bilateral procedures (data from one limb were analyzed). One hundred four limbs (70%) had active ulcers, and 22 (15%) had healed ulcers. A single endoscopic port without insufflation was used in 66 procedures (45%) and laparoscopic instrumentation, with two or three ports, in 82 (55%), with CO2 insufflation in 78 (53%). A tourniquet was used on 112 patients (76%). Concomitant venous procedures were performed in 106 patients (72%; saphenous stripping in 71, high ligation in 17, varicosity avulsion in 85). No early deaths or thromboembolism occurred. Complications included wound infections (9), superficial thrombophlebitis (5), cellulitis (4), and saphenous neuralgia (10). Seven patients with wound infection had open ulcers; nine of 10 with neuralgia had concomitant procedures. A roll-on tourniquet caused skin necrosis in one patient. The clinical score improved from 9.4 to 2.9 after surgery (p < 0.0001). Mean follow-up was 5.4 months; 31 patients had > or = 6 months follow-up. Ulcers healed in 88% (75 of 85); recurrence or new ulcer was reported in 3% (4 of 120).\nThe SEPS modified Linton operation appears safe, with no postoperative deaths or early thromboembolism. Wound infection after SEPS remains important. Early results indicate rapid ulcer healing. Prospective evaluation of long-term results is warranted.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed our experience with a clinical pathway instituted in December 1993 for all nonurgent abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery.\nWe analyzed a reference group of 49 consecutive pre-pathway AAA patients (group I) and the 44 patients enrolled in the first year of the pathway (group II). On the basis of the interim review of data collected during the first year, pathway modifications were made, and 34 patients enrolled after these modifications (group III) were also analyzed.\nComparison of groups I and II showed that institution of the pathway resulted in a marginally significant reduction in mean charges of 14.7% (p = 0.09), and a slight fall in mean length of stay (LOS) (13.8 vs 13.1 days, NS) and mortality rate (4.1% vs 2.3%, NS). For group II, a significant correlate (p < 0.05) of increased charges was fluid overload as diagnosed by chest radiograph. This recognition led to active efforts to reduce perioperative fluid administration. Comparison of groups II and III revealed that the practice modifications led to marked reduction in the incidence of fluid overload (73% vs 24%; p < 0.01), mean charges (30.4% reduction; p < 0.05), mean LOS (13.1 vs 10.2 days; p < 0.05), and median LOS (11 vs 8 days). Multiple regression analysis of all pathway patients showed that preoperative renal insufficiency is a significant predictor of both increased LOS (p < 0.01) and charges (p < 0.01), but that age, sex, and coronary disease were not predictive. Of the postoperative parameters analyzed, important correlates of increased charges were acute renal failure (p < 0.01) and fluid overload (p < 0.01).\nInstitution of a clinical pathway for AAA repair resulted in significant charge reduction and a slight reduction in stay. Practice modifications based on interim data analysis yielded further significant reductions in charges and LOS, with overall per-patient charge savings (group I vs III) of 40.6% (p < 0.05) and overall LOS reduction of 3.5 days (p < 0.05). The reduction in actual charges was seen despite an overall increase in the hospital rate structure. Comparing groups I, II, and III, we found no indication of increasing mortality rate. Ongoing analysis has identified correlates of increased charges, potentially permitting identification of high-cost subgroups and more focused cost-control efforts. Rather than restricting management, clinical pathways with periodic data analysis may improve quality of care.",

Indications for stent placement after suboptimal PTA included flow-limiting dissection, residual pressure gradient (>15 mm Hg) or stenosis (>30%), or failure to establish initial patency. Lesion length ranged from 6 to 35 cm (mean, 16.5 cm). Endpoints for primary patency were: restenosis of >50%, reocclusion, or diminution of the postprocedure ankle-brachial index greater than 0.15.\nThe mean ankle-brachial index improved from 0.48 +/- 0.19 to 0.71 +/- 0.23 (p = 0.001). Primary patency rates by Kaplan-Meier estimates at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year were 88%, 47%, and 22%, respectively. Secondary patency rates were 94% at 1 month, 59% at 6 months, and 46% at 1 year. The median time to reaching an endpoint of restenosis or reocclusion was 6 months primarily and 9 months secondarily. Clinical improvement at the time of latest follow-up occurred in 56% of patients (mean, 13.8 months). Periprocedural complications occurred in 24.5% of patients with the first intervention. The only factor that favorably influenced outcome was improvement in clinical category after the procedure (p = 0.001).\nThere was a high incidence of restenosis and reocclusion with long-segment SFA disease that required stents to achieve initial success. Despite close surveillance and reintervention, anatomic patency at 1 year was poor. However, clinical benefit was maintained in the majority of patients. The outcome was similar in the claudication population compared with those who had limb-threatening ischemia. Percutaneous revascularization of long-segment SFA disease requiring stents should be reserved for patients with critical limb ischemia for which no reasonable surgical alternative exists.",

    "abstract": "Vascular reconstructions are prone to fail as a result of the development of stenotic lesions, which have historically been attributed to myointimal hyperplasia. In animal models, these lesions are associated with marked proliferative smooth muscle cell (SMC) response to vascular injury. However, recent studies using sensitive immunocytochemical techniques in human lesions have generally failed to detect significant cellular proliferation. To clarify the role of cellular proliferation in humans, we characterized the cellular composition and proliferative index of 14 early infrainguinal vein graft stenoses.\nAll infrainguinal vein grafts at our institution are prospectively enrolled in a duplex surveillance protocol, the details of which have been previously reported. Among 98 grafts placed within the last year, 11 patients were identified with 14 progressive, focal, high-grade lesions that met previously established threshold criteria for prophylactic revision to prevent graft thrombosis. Lesions were first detected from 1 week to 7 months after surgery and were removed and replaced with segmental interposition grafts (1.5 to 10 months). Freshly excised lesions were placed in Methyl Carnoy's fixative, paraffin embedded, and serially sectioned. The cellular composition of each lesion was determined with cell-specific immunochemical reagents: alpha SMC actin, von Willebrand factor (endothelial cell), CD 68 (macrophage), and CD 45RB (monocyte). Actively proliferating cells were identified using antibody to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The identity of PCNA-positive cells was determined by double-label immunocytochemical staining, and the proliferative index (PCNA-positive cells/total cells x 100) was calculated by computer-assisted counts of representative gridded cross-sections of each lesion.\nAll excised lesions demonstrated marked thickening with severe luminal encroachment and were highly cellular, with a predominance of alpha SMC actin+. Endothelial cells on the blood flow surface were present to a variable degree, and seven lesions exhibited striking numbers of macrophages and monocytes. The latter cell types were most abundant near microvessels in the deep neointima and adventitia. Active cellular proliferation was identified primarily in SMCs, with a mean PCNA index of 1.34%. However, significant PCNA reactivity was not limited to SMCs, but was also identified in macrophages and monocytes, particularly in lesions greater than 3 months old.\nPrevious immunocytochemical studies of human coronary restenosis atherectomy specimens have generally detected low rates of cellular proliferation (0.5%), but these lesions may not truly represent myointimal hyperplasia, rather a mixture of atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and \"restenosis.\" In contrast, the present study of early human vein graft lesions detected by duplex surveillance indicates that significant cellular proliferation occurs, although rates are lower than those obtained in animals such as the rat carotid injury model. In addition, although SMCs are the predominant proliferating cell type in human vein grafts, our identification of proliferating monocytes and macrophages raises the question of the contribution of an inflammatory component to the development of human lesions. The present study represents the first report of PCNA determination in a series of human infrainguinal vein grafting procedures.",

Endothelial cells on the blood flow surface were present to a variable degree, and seven lesions exhibited striking numbers of macrophages and monocytes. The latter cell types were most abundant near microvessels in the deep neointima and adventitia. Active cellular proliferation was identified primarily in SMCs, with a mean PCNA index of 1.34%. However, significant PCNA reactivity was not limited to SMCs, but was also identified in macrophages and monocytes, particularly in lesions greater than 3 months old.",

    "abstract": "The value of duplex surveillance and the significance of contralateral carotid disease after endarterectomy have been assessed.\nThree hundred five patients were observed prospectively after carotid endarterectomy for a median time of 36 months (range, 6 to 96 months), with duplex surveillance performed at 1 day; 1 week; 3, 6, 9, and 12 months; and then each year after endarterectomy.\nThirty patients (10%) had ipsilateral symptoms (13 strokes, 17 transient ischemic attacks [TIAs]) at a median time of 6 months (range, 0 to 60 months). Life table analysis demonstrated that ipsilateral stroke was equally common for patients who had > or = 50% restenosis (3% at 36 months) and those who did not (6% at 36 months, p > 0.5). Twenty-three patients (8%) developed symptoms (stroke 5, TIA 14) attributable to the contralateral carotid artery at a median time of 9 months (range, 0 to 36 months) after endarterectomy. By life table analysis, 40% of patients with 70% to 99%, 6% with 50% to 69%, 1% with < 50% contralateral internal carotid stenosis, and 5% with contralateral carotid occlusion at the time of endarterectomy had a contralateral TIA in the 36 months after endarterectomy (p < 0.01). However, contralateral stroke was not significantly more common for patients with severe contralateral internal carotid stenosis demonstrated at the time of endarterectomy (< 50% stenosis, 0%; 50% to 69%, 3%; 70% to 99%, 7%; occlusion, 6% stroke rate at 36 months). Seven of the 32 patients who developed progression of contralateral disease had a TIA, compared with 11 of 227 patients who did not develop progression of contralateral disease (p < 0.01). None of the 12 patients who progressed from a < 70% to a 70% to 99% contralateral stenosis had a stroke.\nAfter carotid endarterectomy restenosis is rarely associated with symptoms; contralateral stroke is rare and is not associated with progressive internal carotid artery disease suitable for endarterectomy. This study has shown no benefit from long-term duplex surveillance after carotid endarterectomy. Selective clinical follow-up of patients who have high-grade contralateral stenoses would appear more appropriate.",

    "abstract": "The short and long-term anatomic results of percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) in the treatment of atherosclerotic renovascular disease have been poorly documented because of a lack of follow-up arteriography. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anatomic results of PTRA with serial duplex examinations.\nThe records of 41 patients who underwent 52 primary PTRA procedures and had subsequent duplex follow-up of at least 6 months were reviewed. After PTRA, renal arteries were classified as normal, < 60% stenosis, > or = 60% stenosis, or occluded on the basis of previously validated duplex criteria.\nThe study group included 26 men and 15 women with a mean age of 65 years, who were observed for a mean interval of 34 months. Endovascular stents were placed in 12 of the 52 arteries. The initial post-PTRA renal artery stenosis classification (based on arteriography or duplex scan) was normal in 23, < 60% in 19, and > or = 60% in 10. The cumulative incidence of restenosis from normal to > or = 60% was 13% at 1 year and 19% at 2 years. The cumulative incidence of restenosis from < 60% to > or = 60% was 44% at 1 year and 55% at 2 years. The cumulative incidence of progression from > or = 60% to occlusion was 10% at 2 years. Although 83% of the 12 stented arteries and only 33% of the 40 nonstented arteries were normal immediately after PTRA, after 1 year the stented renal arteries showed a 44% restenosis rate, whereas the nonstented renal arteries showed a 18% restenosis rate (p = 0.087).\nRestenosis after PTRA for atherosclerotic disease is relatively common and correlates with the initial anatomic result. Although PTRA with stent placement yields superior immediate technical results, the high early restenosis rate is disturbing.",

However, the prevalence of PE in the subgroup of patients with respiratory symptoms and isolated calf vein thrombosis (CVT) is unknown. Such information is important in determining whether patients with CVT only and respiratory symptoms should undergo evaluation for PE. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of PE in patients with respiratory symptoms and isolated CVT.\nFrom 1992 through 1994, all patients assessed by duplex scanning for lower extremity DVT were reviewed, and those found to have isolated CVT and lower extremity or respiratory symptoms were identified. Patients who had respiratory symptoms or later developed respiratory symptoms in addition to lower extremity symptoms underwent pulmonary angiography or ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scanning. Positive results on pulmonary arteriograms or \"high probability\" V/Q scans were considered diagnostic of PE.\nThere were 105 patients with isolated CVT and symptoms. Twenty-six patients had respiratory symptoms; nine (35%) had PE and two died. Seventy-nine patients had only lower extremity complaints; five later developed respiratory symptoms. All five had PE and none had progression of CVT on repeat duplex scanning. Neither age, gender, prior DVT/PE, obesity, pregnancy, medication, known malignancy, smoking, recent surgery, or trauma predicted PE.\nPatients with respiratory symptoms and duplex diagnosed isolated CVT have a high prevalence of PE and require pulmonary angiographic or V/Q scanning to rule out PE.",

We focused on gender mix, type of procedure, and secular trends in utilization.\nA total of 1155 procedures were performed, including 733 arterial surgical procedures, 59 balloon angioplasty procedures, and 363 amputations (288 major and 75 minor). Emergency procedures were performed in 12%. Suprainguinal inflow procedures were the most common arterial reconstruction (60%) compared with infrainguinal procedures (40%). The incidence of all revascularization procedures increased in the first decade but reached a plateau after 1985. Utilization rates of revascularization procedures from 1988 to 1992 were higher for men (141.9/100,000 person-years [p-yr]) than women (57.4/100,000 p-yr.). Angioplasty (17.0/100,000 p-yr) rates lagged behind surgery until 1985, but tripled in the past 10 years and have not yet reached a plateau. Although minor amputation rates remain unchanged in 20 years, major amputation rates have been reduced by 50% from 36.7/100,000 p-yr between 1973 and 1977 to 19.0/100,000 p-yr from 1988 to 1992.\nFrom this long-term population-based analysis (1973 to 1992), we conclude that increased vascular surgery and balloon angioplasty rates have coincided with a significant reduction in major amputation rates in the past 10 years.",

    "abstract": "There are excellent arguments in favor of the preferential use of prosthetic grafts above the knee for the treatment of infrainguinal occlusive disease. This approach has been popularized on the basis of the seemingly acceptable results when using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). However, in many centers, knitted Dacron polyester has been used in these patients, and there are several studies that show equivalent and, in some, superior results with Dacron when compared with PTFE. The purpose of this study was to examine these results in a definitive way.\nA randomized prospective trial in eight clinical academic centers in the United States and Canada was initiated in 1991. Two hundred forty-four patients eligible for such a study, by virtue of criteria extant in each institution at the time, were centrally randomized. They underwent placement of either a knitted Dacron polyester graft impregnated with collagen or a thin-wall expanded reenforced PTFE graft to the above-knee popliteal artery, usually from the common femoral artery. They were frequently observed by protocol for as long as 5 years by a physical examination noninvasive hemodynamic study, including duplex scanning in many instances. Continuing patency was noted, as were other potential adverse outcome events. The data were analyzed by the log-rank test for cumulative patency and expressed as Kaplan-Meier curves. Data were further analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards model.\nThere were no differences in graft groups in demographic or comorbid factors. The procedural mortality rate was zero, and the morbidity rate was low (6.5%). The long-term patient survival rate was excellent (77% at 3 years). At the end of these years, no statistical significance in primary or secondary patency rates was observed between the two grafts (primary patency rate, 62% +/- 14.4% for Dacron; 57% +/- 15.5% for PTFE). No unexpected adverse outcomes on limb status were noted. Patency rates in both graft groups were inferior in patients who received small grafts (5 to 6 mm vs 7 to 8 mm; hazards ratio, 4.15) and younger (<65 years) smoking patients.\nThe fact that these two prosthetic grafts performed in equivalent fashion in a controlled, well-conducted prospective study is not surprising in spite of the previous work that suggested differences. If the preferential use of synthetic bypass grafts above the knee is to be used, it should be restricted to older nonsmokers with favorable anatomy. In that instance, the choice of graft material will depend on handling characteristics and cost. Above-knee prostheses should be only selectively used in younger, smoking patients, and graft size should be carefully considered in patients who undergo this operation.",

    "abstract": "The role of complex venous reconstructions (CVRs) in patients with major trauma remains a controversial topic. This study evaluates the patency and clinical outcome of CVRs in a major urban trauma center.\nBetween 1979 and 1994 the records of 92 patients with 100 injuries to the iliac, femoral, and popliteal venous system were reviewed. The incidence of edema, pulmonary embolism, and limb loss was documented in 75 men and 17 women (mean age of 27 years, range 14 to 59 years). The 30-day patencies were assessed in all patients with either impedance plethysmography (n = 16), venography (n = 40), or duplex scan (n = 36). Long-term patencies were assessed in 14 patients monitored for 0.5 to 9 years (mean 3.2 years).\nMechanisms of injury consisted of 58 gunshot wounds, 23 stab wounds, 6 shotgun wounds, and 5 blunt injuries. There were 112 associated injuries, 41 of which were concomitant arterial injuries. Forty-five of the 100 venous injuries were repaired with CVRs and included 6 (13%) spiral vein grafts, 8 (18%) panel vein grafts, 8 (18%) reversed saphenous vein interposition grafts, 8 (18%) end-to-end repairs, and 15 (33%) vein patch repairs. Thirty-day patency rates for these repairs were 50%, 50%, 75%, 88%, and 87%, respectively, and an overall patency rate of 73% was observed. The remaining 55 injuries were treated with ligation (n = 27) or lateral venorrhaphy (n = 28). The cumulative 30-day patency rate for all venous repairs was 81% (59 of 73). Fourteen patients, nine of whom had CVRs, were available for long-term follow-up. In this group CVRs demonstrated a 100% patency. One patient with a spiral vein graft repair of the common femoral vein had severe reflux causing intermittent edema and mild lipodermatosclerosis. No pulmonary emboli, limb loss, or deaths were identified in patients undergoing CVRs.\nPatients with CVRs had a 30-day patency rate of 73%. Of this group panel and spiral vein grafts were less successful, exhibiting only a 50% 30-day patency rate, whereas end-to-end and vein patch repairs were successful in 88% and 87% of cases, respectively. Our overall evaluation suggests that use of CVRs results in successful venous repair; however, the postoperative patency of interposition panel and spiral grafts suggests selective use of these techniques.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial-derived vasorelaxants such as prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO) induce vascular smooth muscle relaxation through activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent cellular signalling pathways. However, the specific events that lead to dissociation of actin and myosin and relaxation are not known. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the late phase signaling events that modulate vascular smooth muscle relaxation.\nFresh bovine carotid artery smooth muscle (BCASM) contractile responses were determined in a muscle bath under Ca(2+)-containing and Ca(2+)-free conditions. Physiologic responses were correlated with phosphorylation events using whole cell phosphorylation and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.\nCyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation can occur without detectable changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. However, vascular smooth muscles that had been precontracted with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin were refractory to relaxation. Vascular smooth muscle relaxation was associated with an increase in the phosphorylation of two 20 kDa proteins under Ca(2+)-containing and Ca(2+)-free conditions.\nThese results suggest that Ca(2+)-independent mechanisms may also modulate vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Two possible late phase signaling mechanisms include phosphatase activation and an increase in the phosphorylation of two 20 kDa phosphoproteins.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a prospective study to clarify the clinical utility of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in the treatment of patients with lower extremity arterial occlusive disease.\nDuring the interval of September 1993 through March 1995, 79 patients (43% claudicants, 57% limb-threatening ischemia) were studied with both MRA and contrast arteriography (ANGIO) and underwent intervention with either balloon angioplasty (9%), surgical inflow (28%), or outflow (63%) procedures. MRA and ANGIO were interpreted by separate blinded vascular radiologists, and arterial segments from the pelvis to the foot were graded as normal or with increasing degrees of mild (25% to 50%), moderate (51% to 75%), or severe (75% to 99%) stenosis or occlusion. Treatment plans were formulated by the attending surgeon and were based initially on hemodynamic, clinical, and MRA data and thereafter with ANGIO. Additional study surgeons formulated independent and specific treatment plans based on MRA or ANGIO alone. Indexes of agreement (beyond chance) for arterial segments depicted by MRA and ANGIO were assessed (kappa value), and treatment plans formulated were compared (chi-square).\nPrecise agreement (%) and the percent of major discrepancies (segment classified as normal/mild stenosis on one study and severe stenosis/occlusion on the other) between MRA and ANGIO for respective arterial segments was as follows: common and external iliacs (n = 256) 77/3.5; superficial femoral and above-knee popliteal (n = 255) 73/6.7; below-knee popliteal (n = 131) 84/3.8; infrapopliteal runoff vessels (n = 864) 74/12.4; pedal vessels (n = 111) 69/19.8 Kappa values indicated moderate agreement (between MRA and ANGIO) beyond chance for all arterial segments. Treatment plans formulated by the attending surgeon, the MRA surgeon, and the ANGIO surgeon agreed in more than 85% of cases. Inability of MRA to assess the significance of inflow disease and inadequate detail of tibial/pedal vessels were the principal deficiencies of MRA in those cases where it was considered an inadequate examination.\nThese findings suggest MRA and ANGIO are nearly equivalent examinations in the demonstration of infrainguinal vascular anatomy. MRA is an adequate preoperative imaging study (and may replace ANGIO), particularly in those circumstances when the risk of ANGIO is increased or when clinical and hemodynamic evaluation predict the likelihood of straightforward aortofemoral or femoral-popliteal reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "The numerous options currently available for treatment of aortoiliac occlusive disease have led to considerable controversy in regard to the optimal method of revascularization in such patients. Differences of opinion exist not only with respect to certain technical aspects of direct anatomic aortic reconstruction, which has traditionally been regarded as the \"gold standard\" treatment, but even more importantly as to whether alternative methods including a variety of catheter-based endoluminal therapies and extraanatomic grafts may offer nearly equivalent results with less risk and possible cost advantages. Although little truly definitive data is available, a review of published information can help clarify many of these management dilemmas. In the final analysis, the various methods may not be as competitive with one another as first seems apparent. Each has its own specific advantages and disadvantages and when used, in appropriate circumstances can provide excellent results. Indeed, it is this broad spectrum of options that can be matched to each patient's own unique anatomic and risk characteristics that make treatment of aortoiliac disease one of the most successful areas of contemporary vascular surgery practice.",

The purpose of this study was to explore whether patients with inflammatory AAAs express disease-relevant genes associated with the HLA-DR region on the short arm of chromosome 6.\nThirty-seven patients with histomorphologic findings of inflammatory AAA at operation were genotyped for the polymorphism of the HLA-DR B1 and HLA DQ B1 alleles and compared to ethnically matched, healthy control subjects (n = 90).\nDistribution of HLA-DR B1 alleles was nonrandom in patients with inflammatory AAAs versus control subjects. The HLA-DR B1 alleles B1*15 and B1*0404 were enriched in patients with inflammatory AAAs compared with control subjects (47% versus 27%, and 14% versus 3%; p < 0.05, respectively). Analysis of functionally relevant amino acid polymorphisms encoded by the HLA-DR B1 gene showed relevance at amino acid position 70. HLA-DR B1 alleles overrepresented in patients with inflammatory AAAs express a glutamine substitution at position 70, whereas alleles disfavored in the patient cohort express a negatively charged aspartic acid. Distribution of HLA-DQ B1 alleles were indistinguishable in patients and control subjects.\nThese data indicate that a genetic risk determinant can be mapped to the HLA-DR B1 locus in patients with inflammatory AAAs. This association suggests a critical contribution of antigen binding in the pathogenesis of this disease.",

    "abstract": "In vivo, the coagulation pathway is triggered by formation of a high-affinity complex between the tissue factor of the injured vascular wall and the activated form of blood coagulation factor VII (VIIa). We used a rabbit model of arterial thrombosis to examine the antithrombotic effect of topically administered active site-inactivated recombinant human factor VIIa (VIIai), which binds to tissue factor but is unable to initiate coagulation.\nSegments of both central arteries of rabbits' ears were isolated between vascular clamps, followed by arteriotomies and deep-vessel wall trauma. In each rabbit, the injured vessel segments were superfused with either VIIai (0.5 mg in 200 microliters vehicle) or vehicle alone in a blinded random manner (n = 20). The vessels were then closed with running sutures and reperfused. The effect of intravenously infused VIIai (4 mg/kg) or vehicle was studied in a separate series.\nThe administration of VIIai increased patency rates from 40% and 30% in the vehicle group at 30 and 120 minutes after reperfusion, respectively, to 85% and 75% in the VIIai group (p = 0.008 and p = 0.004). No antihemostatic side effects occurred: median arteriotomy bleeding times were 2 minutes in the vehicle group and 1 1/2 minutes in the VIIai group (p = 1). By contrast, intravenous infusion of VIIai produced no antithrombotic effect.\nWe have shown that topical administration of VIIai at arterial trauma sites produces an antithrombotic effect without the expense of a hemostatic defect. This mode of treatment seems to be highly attractive in the prevention of thrombotic complications in surgery on blood vessels.",

    "abstract": "Patients with aneurysmal disease involving both the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta have historically required simultaneous or sequential conventional operations, but the morbidity rate is high with either approach in these patients, who often exhibit coexisting cardiopulmonary disease. Transluminally placed endovascular grafts have recently been developed for repair of aortic aneurysms, and we have implemented these techniques to eliminate the need for a thoracotomy in patients with multilevel aortic disease.\nSince January 1994, 18 patients have undergone conventional abdominal aortic replacement with endovascular stent-graft placement into the descending thoracic aorta under fluoroscopic guidance through a 10 mm Dacron side limb off the abdominal graft. Abdominal aortic replacement required a tube graft in eight patients and bifurcated grafts in 10 patients. Thoracic stent-grafts (custom fabricated, woven Dacron covered, self-expandable stents) averaged 12.2 +/- 4.2 cm (mean +/- SD) in length.\nOne patient died, resulting in a hospital mortality rate of 6%. No patients required further surgical intervention to treat their aortic disease. Seventeen patients (94%) are currently well 14 +/- 8 months after surgery (range, 3 to 29 months) with completely excluded thoracic aortic disease, no stent migration, and no change in stent configuration documented by serial radiologic examinations.\nSimultaneous abdominal aortic replacement and deployment of a thoracic stent-graft can safely exclude multilevel aortic aneurysmal disease and may be a valuable treatment option for these otherwise high-risk patients.",

We retrospectively studied clinical characteristics of premature CAS and the safety and durability of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in 56 patients 50 years of age or younger (mean, 46.4 years; 34 (60%) males; group I) who underwent primary CEA at the Cleveland Clinic between 1983 and 1993.\nThe patients were identified from the Vascular Surgery Registry and were compared with 202 randomly selected patients 60 years of age and older (mean, 69.3 years; group II) who were frequency-matched by gender and the year of primary CEA. Carotid shunting was used routinely, and the arteriotomy was patched in the majority of cases. Patients were followed-up for mean of 47.2 months (group I) and 46.0 months (group II).\nNo significant differences were found in the indications for CEA (symptomatic CAS, 49% in group I vs 48% in group II) or the prevalence of diabetes, coronary diseases, and lower extremity arterial disease. Younger adults were more likely to have a history of smoking (93% vs 76%; p = 0.005), hypertension (71% vs 52%; p = 0.006), premature menopause (57% vs 18%; p < 0.001) and had lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.03). There were no in-hospital deaths. Perioperative strokes in the distribution of the operated artery occurred within 24 hours in one younger patient (1.8%) and in one older patient (0.5%). This was attributed to early carotid thrombosis in the young patient. Major late postoperative neurologic complications were documented in one young patient (1.8%) and six older patients (3%). Patients in group I were at significantly higher risk for recurrent carotid stenosis (risk ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 7.3; p = 0.010); younger individuals remained at significantly higher risk for recurrent stenosis even after adjusting for smoking and hypertension (risk ratio, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 9.4; p = 0.006). By life-table analysis, younger adults tended to have a higher rate of late reoperations (p = 0.065).\nCEA can be safely performed in young adults with premature CAS, although younger individuals appear to have higher rates of recurrent carotid stenosis compared with older counterparts.",

Isolated segments of rat common carotid artery were infected with an adenoviral vector encoding an antisense bFGF transcript at concentrations of 2 x 10(9), 1 x 10(10), or 1 x 10(11) pfu/ml. Control rats were treated with either a control adenovirus encoding the beta-galactosidase gene, (Ad.lacZ), at 1 x 10(10), or 1 x 10(11) pfu/ml, or phosphate-buffered saline solution (vehicle). Two weeks after injury the rats were killed and perfusion-fixed. Cross-sectional areas of the carotid arterial intima and media were measured by planimetry, and the intima/media ratio (I/M) was calculated for each vessel.\nThe mean I/M for each Ad.ASbFGF group and controls were compared and the significance assessed by analysis of variance. At two weeks after injury, the highest dose of Ad.ASbFGF, 1 x 10(11) pfu/ml, resulted in a near total inhibition of thickening (I/M = 0.14 +/- 0.04, mean +/- SEM) when compared with phosphate-buffered saline solution alone (I/M = 0.99 +/- 0.07), or Ad.lacZ 1 x 10(10) pfu/ml (I/M = 1.01 +/- 0.10) control treatments (p < 0.01). A tenfold lower dose of Ad.ASbFGF, 1 x 10(10) pfu/ml, also caused significant reduction in intimal thickening (I/M = 0.39 +/- 0.07, p < 0.01). Treatment with 2 x 10(9) pfu/ml Ad.ASbFGF did not significantly limit intimal thickening (I/M = 0.72 +/- 0.12).\nInhibition of bFGF synthesis in vivo using an antisense RNA strategy significantly inhibits intimal thickening after arterial balloon injury. This study suggests that continued bFGF synthesis contributes to intimal thickening after arterial injury, and that antisense bFGF may represent an effective strategy in limiting restenosis after angioplasty.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to test the effectiveness of a formal supervised exercise program against a home-based exercise program for both walking ability and quality of life endpoints.\nPatients with arterial claudication were randomized to either a 12-week supervised exercise program (SUPEX) with weekly lectures relating to peripheral vascular disease or to a home exercise group (HOMEX) who attended an identical lecture program and received weekly exercise instruction. The study population included 29 men and 26 women, with a mean age of 69.1 +/- 8.1 years. Forty-seven patients completed the 12-week program, 46 were available for testing at completion, and 38 for 6-month testing. Claudication pain time (CPT) and maximum walking time (MWT) on a progressive treadmill exercise test were assessed at baseline, program completion, and 6 months. The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) was administered at these intervals to assess effects on quality of life.\nEach group improved (p < 0.001) in both CPT and MWT at the completion of the 12-week program, which was sustained at the 6-month follow-up. Increase in HOMEX CPT from baseline (3.6 +/- 2.73 minutes) to 6-month follow-up (6.6 +/- 3.17 minutes) was less than for the SUPEX group (3.8 +/- 2.74 to 11.2 +/- 4.02 minutes, respectively); similar results were obtained for MWT. At both completion and 6 months, there was a significant intergroup difference for CPT and MWT (p < 0.004) favoring SUPEX. For both groups, measures of health perception based on the SF-36 demonstrated improvement (p < 0.002) in Physical Function Subscale, Bodily Pain Subscale, and Physical Composite Score. There were no between-group differences on the subsets of the SF-36 at the three assessment intervals.\nSupervised exercise programs provide superior increased walking ability in the noninterventional therapy of arterial claudication, and both supervised and home based exercise therapy result in improved SF-36 functional measures. The lack of intergroup differences in these measures may be a result of the high degree of interaction with healthcare providers in the HOMEX group. Although a supervised program results in optimal walking benefits, a highly structured home-based program provides similar functional improvement and may be a satisfactory alternative for patients with lesser walking requirements.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy for treating asymptomatic patients with > or = 60% internal carotid stenosis, based on outcomes reported in the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS).\nA cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a Markov decision model in which the probabilities for base-case analysis (average age, 67 years; 66% male; perioperative stroke plus death rate, 2.3%; ipsilateral stroke rate during medical management, 2.3% per year) were based on ACAS. The model assumed that patients who had TIAs or minor strokes during medical management crossed over to surgical treatment, and used the NASCET data to model the outcome of these now-symptomatic patients. Average cost of surgery ($8500), major stroke ($34,000 plus $18,000 per year), and other costs were based on local cost determinations plus a review of the published literature. Cost-effectiveness was calculated as the incremental cost of surgery per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved when compared with medical treatment, discounting at 5% per year. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of key variables on cost-effectiveness.\nIn the base-case analysis, surgical treatment improved quality-adjusted life expectancy from 7.87 to 8.12 QALYs, at an incremental lifetime cost of $2041. This yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $8,000 per QALY saved by surgical compared with medical treatment. The high cost of care after major stroke during medical management largely offset the initial cost of endarterectomy in the surgical group. Furthermore, 26% of medically managed patients eventually underwent endarterectomy because of symptom development, which also decreased the cost differential. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the relative cost of surgical treatment increased substantially with increasing age, increasing perioperative stroke rate, and decreasing stroke rate during medical management.\nFor the typical asymptomatic patient in ACAS with > or = 60% carotid stenosis, our results indicate that carotid endarterectomy is cost-effective when compared with other commonly accepted health care practices. Surgery does not appear cost-effective in very elderly patients, in settings where the operative stroke risk is high, or in patients with very low stroke risk without surgery.",

    "abstract": "Functional outcome after infrainguinal bypass (IB) has recently been assessed with global health status questionnaires but not by criteria specific to the objectives of IB (i.e., maintenance of independent living and ambulation). Preoperative and postoperative living situation and ambulatory status were evaluated in patients who underwent IB for limb salvage (LS) indications.\nFor patients in whom IB was performed for LS from January 1980 to July 1995, living situation (independent or dependent) and ambulatory status were assessed before the onset of the need for LS surgery and 6 months after surgery. The importance of risk factors (age, sex, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, renal insufficiency or failure, previous leg bypass, indication for surgery, postoperative morbidity, graft patency) was assessed by multivariate analysis.\nIB for LS was performed in 513 patients. Before the development of the indication for LS surgery, 92% lived independently and 91% were ambulatory. The operative mortality rate was 2.7%. At 6 months, 86% were alive and the assisted primary graft patency rate was 92%. Ninety-nine percent of survivors who lived independently before developing the need for LS surgery remained independent 6 months after surgery, and 97% of those who were ambulatory before developing the need for LS surgery were ambulatory 6 months after surgery. Only one of 25 survivors (4%) who were not living independently before surgery achieved independent living 6 months after surgery. Twenty-one percent of nonambulatory patients (6 of 29) became ambulatory. Multivariate analysis confirmed the importance of preoperative living situation and ambulatory status in predicting outcome at 6 months (p < 0.0001). Amputation and loss of primary patency were predictive of poor ambulatory status at 6 months (p < 0.0001, p = 0.025, respectively). The overall 5-year survival rate was 48.1%.\nPreoperative independence and ambulation best predict postoperative independence and ambulation after IB for LS indications. IB procedures performed for limb salvage have a low operative mortality rate and maintain independent living and ambulation in 99% and 97% of patients, respectively. Poor overall long-term outcome and survival in LS patients results from intercurrent illness and not from IB.",

    "abstract": "Graft-related complications must be factored into the long-term morbidity and mortality rates of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. However, the true incidence may be underestimated because some patients do not return to the original surgical center when a problem arises.\nTo minimize referral bias and loss to follow-up, we studied all patients who underwent AAA repair between 1957 and 1990 in a geographically defined community where all AAA operations were performed and followed by a single surgical practice. All patients who remained alive were asked to have their aortic grafts imaged.\nAmong 307 patients who underwent AAA repair, 29 patients (9.4%) had a graft-related complication. At a mean follow-up of 5.8 years (range, < 30 days to 36 years), the most common complication was anastomotic pseudoaneurysm (3.0%), followed by graft thrombosis (2.0%), graft-enteric erosion/fistula (1.6%), graft infection (1.3%), anastomotic hemorrhage (1.3%), colon ischemia (0.7%), and atheroembolism (0.3%). Complications were recognized within 30 days after surgery in eight patients (2.6%) and at late follow-up in 21 patients (6.8%). These complications were observed at a median follow-up of 6.1 years for anastomotic pseudoaneurysm, 4.3 years for graft-enteric erosion, and 0.15 years for graft infection. Kaplan-Meier 5- and 10-year survival free estimates were 98% and 96% for anastomotic pseudoaneurysm, 98% and 95% for combined graft-enteric erosion/infection, and 98% and 97% for graft thrombosis.\nThis 36-year population-based study confirms that the vast majority of patients who undergo standard surgical repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm remain free of any significant graft-related complication during their remaining lifetime.",

    "abstract": "Autogenous aortoiliac/femoral reconstruction with superficial femoral-popliteal veins (SFPVs) has been successfully used to treat prosthetic infection and failure, but outcome data are scant. In this prospective, observational study, we hypothesized that (1) replacement of the aortoiliac/femoral system with SFPVs could be performed with perioperative morbidity and mortality rates equal to those of conventional methods; (2) long-term patency rates would be excellent; (3) limb salvage rates would be correspondingly high; (4) aneurysmal degeneration would not occur, and (5) venous morbidity would be minimal.\nSince 1990, 41 patients have undergone complete or partial aortoiliac/femoral reconstruction with 63 SFPVs with a mean (+/-SD) follow-up time of 32 +/- 21 months. With the exception of two patients lost to follow-up, all have been observed at 6-month intervals with clinical examination and noninvasive tests.\nThere were no immediate operative deaths, but three patients (7.3%) died of multisystem organ failure after 1 month. Forty-nine percent of patients had significant perioperative complications including amputation (5%), compartment syndrome (12.3%), and pulmonary embolism (2.4%). Most patients (85%) had multilevel occlusive disease, and the mean SVS/ISCVS runoff score for the group was 4.9 +/- 2.6 (1 = normal, 10 = no runoff). Fifty-eight percent of all distal anastomoses were end-to-end, and in 68% of limbs the profunda femoris artery or superficial femoral artery was the sole runoff vessel. At 5 years, the cumulative secondary patency rate was 100%; primary patency rate, 83%; limb retention rate, 86%; and survival rate, 69%. Four patients had permanent limb edema controlled by compression stockings but none have had venous ulceration. There has been no aneurysmal dilation of SFPV grafts, and mean diameter shown by serial duplex imaging at 6 months (10.8 +/- 1.1 mm) was not significantly different from that at 60 months (7.8 +/- 1.1 mm).\nAortoiliac/femoral reconstruction with SFPVs is a successful and durable option for infection and other complex aortic problems.",

    "abstract": "An increased incidence of bleeding complications has been observed after supraceliac aortic clamping (SCC). This study was performed to identify possible hemostatic abnormalities that contribute to this problem.\nA prospective cohort study over a 3-month period was performed by comparing hemostatic parameters in 10 consecutive patients who required elective SCC with those of eight concurrent randomly selected control subjects who required infrarenal clamping (IRC) for abdominal aortic reconstruction. Measures of coagulation, fibrinolysis, platelet function, temperature, hemodilution, and hepatic function were performed at selected times before, during, and after operation.\nAneurysm size, fibrinogen, D-dimers, prothrombin, partial thromboplastin time, platelet counts, bleeding times, hemodilution, and temperature were comparable in both groups. Patients in the SCC group, however, consistently developed a primary fibrinolytic state within 20 minutes after supraceliac clamping, reflected by significantly decreased euglobulin clot lysis times (ECLT; p < 0.0001), elevated tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) levels (p < 0.0006), elevated t-PA-to-plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ratios (p < 0.0001), and reduced alpha 2-antiplasmin levels (p < 0.002). SCC produced hepatocellular injury documented by elevations in both aspartate transaminase (p < 0.0001) and lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0.009).\nSCC rapidly induces a primary fibrinolytic state manifested by increased circulating t-PA, reduced alpha 2-antiplasmin, and increased fibrinolytic activator-to-inhibitor ratios. These effects may be a result of hepatic hypoperfusion caused by SCC leading to insufficient clearance of t-PA. Antifibrinolytic agents may be of benefit if bleeding develops after aortic procedures that require supraceliac clamping.",

    "abstract": "This report summarizes our experience with epidural cooling (EC) to achieve regional spinal cord hypothermia and thereby decrease the risk of spinal cord ischemic injury during the course of descending thoracic aneurysm (TA) and thoracoabdominal aneurysm (TAA) repair.\nDuring the interval July 1993 to Dec. 1995, 70 patients underwent TA (n = 9, 13%) or TAA (n = 61) (type I, 24 [34%], type II, 11 [15%], type III, 26 [37%]) repair using the EC technique. The latter was accomplished by continuous infusion of normal saline (4 degrees C) into a T11-12 epidural catheter; an intrathecal catheter was placed at the L3-4 level for monitoring of cerebrospinal fluid temperature (CSFT) and pressure (CSFP). All operations (one exception, atriofemoral bypass) were performed with the clamp-and-sew technique, and 50% of patients had preservation of intercostal vessels at proximal or distal anastomoses (30%) or by separate inclusion button (20%). Neurologic outcome was compared with a published predictive model for the incidence of neurologic deficits after TAA repair and with a matched (Type IV excluded) consecutive, control group (n = 55) who underwent TAA repair in the period 1990 to 1993 before use of EC.\nEC was successful in all patients, with a 1442 +/- 718 ml mean (range, 200 to 3500 ml) volume of infusate; CSFT was reduced to a mean of 24 degrees +/- 3 degrees C during aortic cross-clamping with maintenance of core temperature of 34 degrees +/- 0.8 +/- C. Mean CSFP increased from baseline values of 13 +/- 8 mm Hg to 31 +/- 6 mm Hg during cross-clamp. Seven patients (10%) died within 60 days of surgery, but all survived long enough for evaluation of neurologic deficits. The EC group and control group were well-matched with respect to mean age, incidence of acute presentations/aortic dissection/aneurysm rupture, TAA type distribution, and aortic cross-clamp times. Two lower extremity neurologic deficits (2.9%) were observed in the EC patients and 13 (23%) in the control group (p < 0.0001). Observed and predicted deficits in the EC patients were 2.9% and 20.0% (p = 0.001), and for the control group 23% and 17.8% (p = 0.48). In considering EC and control patients (n = 115), variables associated with postoperative neurologic deficit were prolonged (> 60 min) visceral aortic cross-clamp time (relative risk, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 16.5; p = 0.02) and lack of epidural cooling (relative risk, 9.8; 95% CI, 2 to 48; p = 0.005).\nEC is a safe and effective technique to increase the ischemic tolerance of the spinal cord during TA or TAA repair. When used in conjunction with a clamp-and-sew technique and a strategy of selective intercostal reanastomosis, EC has significantly reduced the incidence of neurologic deficits after TAA repair.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether the incidence of vein graft stenosis is related to bypass grafting technique and thus modification of postoperative surveillance protocols may be required.\nFrom 1991 to 1996, 338 infrainguinal vein bypasses constructed using in situ (n = 131), reversed (n = 120), nonreversed translocated (n = 48), or spliced/upper extremity vein (n = 39) grafting techniques were evaluated by intraoperative duplex scanning to optimize bypass construction and serially thereafter to detect developing vein graft stenoses. Bypass procedures were performed in 322 patients for critical limb ischemia (83%), claudication (13%), or popliteal aneurysm (4%). Using life-table analysis, graft patency and revision/failure rates were compared relative to grafting technique, need for operative revision, and intraoperative duplex scan results.\nThree-year primary and secondary graft patency rates were higher (p < 0.001) for in situ bypass grafts (85%/97%) compared with reversed (57%/83%), nonreversed translocated (62%/78%), or alternative (51%/76%) vein bypass grafts. During a mean follow-up interval of 19 months, the incidence of graft revision was higher for reversed saphenous (23%) and alternative (28%) vein bypass grafts compared with in situ (10%) or nonreversed (16%) saphenous vein bypass grafts. Despite a normal intraoperative graft duplex scan, the revision/failure rate of reversed vein grafts was 2.5 times greater than in situ/nonreversed translocated vein conduits (primary patency rate at 3 years, 60% vs 87%, p = 0.009). Bypass grafts modified at operation on the basis of duplex scanning were two times more likely to require postoperative revision than grafts with normal intraoperative scans.\nThe incidence of postoperative graft stenosis and need for revision varies with bypass grafting technique. Reversed vein bypasses and grafts modified at operation may be more prone than in situ vein bypass grafts to develop stenosis and thus require intensive surveillance. Infrainguinal vein graft failure and the need for revision may be reduced by the adoption of bypass grafting techniques that include valve lysis and intraoperative duplex scan assessment.",

During a mean follow-up interval of 19 months, the incidence of graft revision was higher for reversed saphenous (23%) and alternative (28%) vein bypass grafts compared with in situ (10%) or nonreversed (16%) saphenous vein bypass grafts. Despite a normal intraoperative graft duplex scan, the revision/failure rate of reversed vein grafts was 2.5 times greater than in situ/nonreversed translocated vein conduits (primary patency rate at 3 years, 60% vs 87%, p = 0.009). Bypass grafts modified at operation on the basis of duplex scanning were two times more likely to require postoperative revision than grafts with normal intraoperative scans.",

Associated spontaneous thrombotic complications are generally venous in nature, with arterial thrombosis occurring less frequently.

The hepatic artery aneurysm underwent successful embolization. Because of the patient's poor general condition, the superior mesenteric aneurysm was considered inoperable and has been kept under surveillance by ultrasonography. Arterial involvement in Von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis is a well-known but infrequent occurrence. Stenotic lesions predominate, with the renal arteries being the site of predilection. Aneurysmal defects are less common, and involvement of the visceral arteries is exceptional. Only three reports of superior mesenteric artery aneurysm in patients with Von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis were found in the literature, and hepatic artery aneurysm has never previously been described in this disease.",

Women who had operations for intact AAA had a 1.4 times greater risk of dying compared with men, and women who had operations for ruptured AAA had a 1.45 times greater risk of dying, after controlling for other predictors of death (95% confidence intervals, 1.14 to 1.73 and 1.10 to 1.90, respectively).\nIn a population-based statewide experience, women who had intact or ruptured AAA were less likely than men to undergo aortic reconstruction and, when they did, were less likely than men to survive to discharge.",

    "abstract": "This is an analysis of early postcarotid endarterectomy (CEA) wall thickness in patients who have undergone bilateral operations with vein and Dacron patch reconstructions.\nIn the past 5 years 23 patients had staged bilateral CEA within 2 months with an autologous greater saphenous vein patch on one side and a knitted Dacron patch on the other. Duplex scans with adequate B-mode resolution to measure common carotid bulb total wall thickness were performed in all 23 patients during the first post-CEA year and in 12 patients in the post-CEA second year.\nThere were no hemodynamically detectable restenoses by Doppler velocity criteria. All peak systolic velocities were < or = 110 cm/sec. In the first post-CEA year the total wall thickness of the 23 vein patch CEA was 1.7 +/- 1.0 mm (mean +/- 1 SD; range, 0.6 to 5.5 mm), and the total wall thickness of the 22 Dacron patch CEA was 1.7 +/- 1.1 mm (range, 0.6 to 6.1 mm, p = 0.93). In the second post-CEA year wall thickness was 2.1 +/- 1.8 mm (range, 0.6 to 5.8 mm) in the vein patch arteries and 2.0 +/- 1.5 mm (range, 0.6 to 5.4 mm, p = 0.91) in the Dacron patch arteries. Although wall thickness of both vein and Dacron patch CEA varied widely between patients, the within-patient absolute difference between the two sides was quite small, 0.1 +/- 0.3 mm in the first year and 0.2 +/- 0.5 mm in the second. With a 5% chance of a type I statistical error (alpha = 0.05) to detect a 0.5 mm difference in wall thickness between Dacron and vein patch CEA, the power of the paired t test is > 0.999, and the probability of a type II error, beta, is < 0.001 (power = 1-beta) in the first year. In the second year beta = 0.34. Wall thickness was bilaterally eccentric in 17 patients. The minimum thickness was in the patch wall, and the maximum was in the opposite endarterectomized wall. It was circumferentially uniform in five patients with < 1 mm wall thickness. The single patient with significant bilaterally concentric wall thickness in the first year was the only one who had a marked increase in wall thickness between the first and second years. Wall thickness > 2 mm was associated with continued smoking (p = 0.03).\nPost-CEA wall thickening is highly patient-dependent but is patch material-independent. Knitted Dacron and saphenous vein patch reconstructed carotid arteries develop almost identical wall thickness in a given patient in the first 2 years after endarterectomy. These results support the use of knitted Dacron as an acceptable alternative to greater saphenous for a CEA patch.",

In the first post-CEA year the total wall thickness of the 23 vein patch CEA was 1.7 +/- 1.0 mm (mean +/- 1 SD; range, 0.6 to 5.5 mm), and the total wall thickness of the 22 Dacron patch CEA was 1.7 +/- 1.1 mm (range, 0.6 to 6.1 mm, p = 0.93). In the second post-CEA year wall thickness was 2.1 +/- 1.8 mm (range, 0.6 to 5.8 mm) in the vein patch arteries and 2.0 +/- 1.5 mm (range, 0.6 to 5.4 mm, p = 0.91) in the Dacron patch arteries. Although wall thickness of both vein and Dacron patch CEA varied widely between patients, the within-patient absolute difference between the two sides was quite small, 0.1 +/- 0.3 mm in the first year and 0.2 +/- 0.5 mm in the second. With a 5% chance of a type I statistical error (alpha = 0.05) to detect a 0.5 mm difference in wall thickness between Dacron and vein patch CEA, the power of the paired t test is > 0.999, and the probability of a type II error, beta, is < 0.001 (power = 1-beta) in the first year. In the second year beta = 0.34. Wall thickness was bilaterally eccentric in 17 patients. The minimum thickness was in the patch wall, and the maximum was in the opposite endarterectomized wall. It was circumferentially uniform in five patients with < 1 mm wall thickness. The single patient with significant bilaterally concentric wall thickness in the first year was the only one who had a marked increase in wall thickness between the first and second years. Wall thickness > 2 mm was associated with continued smoking (p = 0.03).",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of everted cervical veins used as patches after carotid endarterectomy.\nA prospective nonrandomized comparative analysis was performed on patients with either everted cervical veins or saphenous veins as patches after carotid endarterectomy. Two hundred ninety-six patients underwent 329 carotid endarterectomies during an 8 1/2-year period (1987 to 1995). Saphenous vein patches were used in 125 (38%) cases and everted cervical veins in 167 (51%). These two groups were compared clinically and by sonographic surveillance. The mean follow-up of patients in this study was 27 +/- 11 months.\nNo significant differences were noted regarding postoperative morbid events between the everted cervical and saphenous vein patch groups. Even at 5 years the percentage of patients without stroke for both groups exceeded 95%. Duplex surveillance studies also showed comparable percentages of recurrent moderate (50% to 69%) and severe (70% to 99%) stenosis, 5.6% and 6.9%, respectively, for everted cervical vein and 5.4% and 6.5%, respectively, for saphenous vein. Cumulative recurrent stenosis-free rates at 5 and 6 years exceeded 82% for each of the patch study groups.\nBased on the results of this study everted cervical veins are useful adjuncts to carotid endarterectomy, when patch angioplasty is necessary or desirable. Their performance is comparable to that of saphenous veins. Cervical veins are usually available, even when the saphenous vein is absent or inadequate. In addition, good saphenous veins can be spared and lower extremity excisions avoided.",

    "abstract": "For the first time efficacy and safety of a new prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) regimen in the treatment of intermittent claudication were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial. The study involved 213 outpatients with a maximum walking distance of 50 to 200 m measured on the treadmill (3 km/hr, 12% grade). After a 2-week run-in phase they received a 2-hour intravenous infusion of 60 micrograms PGE1 or placebo 5 days a week for 4 weeks. It was followed by a 4-week interval treatment with the same medication administered only twice a week. Patients were monitored for 3 months when they received no study medication. In the PGE1 group the intention-to-treat analysis (n = 208) revealed an increase in walking distance after 4 weeks of 75% (placebo, 43%). At the end of the interval treatment the walking distance had improved to 101% (placebo, 60%). The results remained virtually constant during follow-up (PGE1, 104%, placebo, 63%). Between-group comparisons showed significant differences in favor of PGE1 for all three time points of measurement (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.05). PGE1 was well tolerated; the rate of adverse reactions related to the treatment was 12.8% (placebo, 7.7%). In summary, these results show that the new PGE1 regimen is effective and safe in the treatment of outpatients with intermittent claudication.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop a cost-effective canine graft healing model that gives information on various implant sites and controls for variable factors between graft locations and between animals and to compare the influence of implant site (retropleural, retroperitoneal, and subcutaneous areas) on arterial graft healing in the same subject under such controlled study conditions.\nFive mongrel dogs were studied for 8 weeks, and one was studied for 3 years. Each received three porous Dacron grafts during the same surgery: a carotid-femoral bypass (C-FB) and interposition grafts in the descending thoracic aorta and abdominal aorta. To produce comparable shear stress calibers of the C-FB and abdominal aorta grafts were 2 mm less than those of the descending thoracic aorta, and a distal arterio-venous fistula was created to further increase the C-FB flow. For comparable blood aggregation status platelet aggregation was preevaluated and adjusted with antiplatelet agents. Graft flow surfaces were assessed for thrombus-free surface and endothelial-like cell coverage scores. Tissue samples were studied with hematoxylin-eosin, factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor, smooth muscle alpha-actin staining, and scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.\nAll grafts were patent. Shear stress for the three grafts and platelet aggregation among the study subjects were comparable. Healing of descending thoracic aorta and abdominal aorta grafts was similar, but C-FB healing was slow, incomplete, and uneven, with a high incidence of seroma. Eight-week and 3-year results were comparable.\nThis model gives broad healing information about the areas where grafts are often implanted in humans. Eight weeks appears to be a sufficient period to reflect basic and general healing characteristics. Grafts heal better in the retropleural and retroperitoneal areas than in the subcutaneous tissues.",

    "abstract": "Although venous valve lesions have been cited as a mechanism of graft failure, the fate of venous valves in reversed saphenous vein (RSV) bypass grafts is unclear. The basis for this uncertainty is the difficulty in postoperative identification and follow-up of valve sites and the infrequent pathologic submission of vein graft lesions. This report describes the features of \"functional\" valves (FV) visualized in RSV grafts by ultrasonic duplex scanning.\nSixty-six RSV infrainguinal vein grafts were prospectively studied with duplex ultrasonography from January 1992 to December 1995. Grafts were studied at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months, then annually. FV identification was based on a characteristic ultrasound Doppler waveform and color flow pattern and visualization of the leaflets by B-mode imaging. The waveform consists of end-systolic valve closure followed by variable degrees of reflux. Immediate postoperative reactive hyperemia precludes detection, because flow reversal in the graft is needed for identification.\nSince August 1994, 14 FV have been identified in 11 (17%) of 66 RSV grafts. The mean time to FV recognition after implantation was 10 months (range, 1 to 52 months), and the average follow-up was 15 months. One valve was completely competent. Seven (50%) of the FV were associated with the development of a < 50% diameter reducing stenosis by Doppler velocity criteria. None of the FV has required intervention.\n\"Functional\" vein valves in RSV grafts are common and can be identified by ultrasonic duplex imaging. Awareness of the characteristics of FV during routine duplex graft surveillance will undoubtedly increase detection. The variable time course to identification of FV and duration of \"function\" warrants continued follow-up to determine the relationship of these valves to the development of stenotic lesions and graft failure.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of superficial femoral artery (SFA) stenosis morphologic characteristics and lesion location on the rate of atherosclerotic disease progression.\nWe identified 19 patients who required arteriography for treatment of critical leg ischemia and who had previously undergone arteriography of that leg when minimal or no symptoms were present. These initial incidental arteriographic evaluations were performed during evaluation of arterial disease in another vascular bed from 4 to 81 months (mean, 32 months) previously. Distinct SFA stenoses or occlusion on the final arteriogram (n = 98) were characterized by their location, length, stenosis severity, and morphologic appearance on the initial arteriogram. The contribution of patient-specific risk factors to disease progression was also assessed.\nStenosis progression occurred independently among multiple lesions within the same patient (negligible intraclass correlation coefficient, r = 0.06). Lesions in the adductor canal region were more likely to occlude than lesions elsewhere in the SFA (adjusted odds ratio = 10.7; p = 0.03). Severity of initial lesion stenosis also was predictive of occlusion (adjusted odds ratio = 1.8; p = 0.04). However, most progressing lesions (93%) actually arose in areas of initially mild disease (stenoses < 50%) despite more severe initial lesions elsewhere. Increasing age (p = 0.023) and previous contralateral leg bypass (p = 0.036) were also associated with increasing rates of lesion progression. Smooth-asymmetric lesions progressed 11% more slowly than other lesion types (p = 0.003).\nOur analysis of atherosclerotic SFA lesion progression in patients with critical ischemia shows that initial stenosis severity was associated with higher occlusion rates and that smooth-asymmetric lesions progressed more slowly than lesions with other morphologic characteristics. Severe stenoses usually arose from minimally diseased regions and progressed more rapidly than preexisting, more highly stenotic lesions. Most SFA occlusions resulted from disease progression in the adductor canal region whether or not antecedent lesions were seen on arteriography and whether or not more severe stenoses were initially present elsewhere. Increased age and history of previous contralateral bypass were patient-specific predictors of lesion progression.",

Lesions in the adductor canal region were more likely to occlude than lesions elsewhere in the SFA (adjusted odds ratio = 10.7; p = 0.03). Severity of initial lesion stenosis also was predictive of occlusion (adjusted odds ratio = 1.8; p = 0.04). However, most progressing lesions (93%) actually arose in areas of initially mild disease (stenoses < 50%) despite more severe initial lesions elsewhere. Increasing age (p = 0.023) and previous contralateral leg bypass (p = 0.036) were also associated with increasing rates of lesion progression. Smooth-asymmetric lesions progressed 11% more slowly than other lesion types (p = 0.003).",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggesting that genetic factors contribute to the development of common disorders can be obtained by demonstrating familial aggregation of the disease. This study investigated whether thoracic aortic dilations and dissections aggregate in families by comparing the prevalence of thoracic aortic aneurysms, thoracic aortic dissections, and sudden death in first-degree relatives of patients referred for thoracic aortic surgery.\nFamilies were ascertained through 158 nonsyndromic patients referred for surgical correction of either thoracic aortic aneurysms or dissections (probands) and their 843 first-degree relatives. A control group of 547 first-degree relatives was derived from 114 proband spouses. Groups were examined for statistical differences in the prevalence of thoracic aneurysms, thoracic aortic dissections, abdominal aortic aneurysms, sudden death, and myocardial infarctions.\nFirst-degree relatives of probands demonstrated a higher prevalence of thoracic aortic aneurysms and sudden death when compared with the control group. Relative risks of thoracic aortic aneurysm development in proband fathers, brothers, and sisters were 1.8, 10.9, and 1.8, respectively. A pattern of inheritance of the thoracic aortic aneurysms could not be determined.\nThis study indicates proband first-degree relatives are at higher risk of thoracic aortic aneurysms and sudden death compared with a control group. This study supports the role of genetic factors in the cause of thoracic aortic aneurysms and provides important information for identifying individuals at risk.",

    "abstract": "Seroepidemiologic studies have indicated an association between chronic Chlamydia pneumoniae infection and coronary heart disease. The organism, which is a common respiratory pathogen, has been demonstrated in atherosclerotic lesions of the aorta and coronary arteries. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are frequently associated with atherosclerosis, and inflammation may actually be an important factor in aneurysmal dilatation. Hence it could be assumed that C. pneumoniae may play a role in maintaining an inflammation and triggering the development of aortic aneurysms.\nSpecimens from abdominal aortic aneurysm were examined for the presence of C. pneumoniae by immunohistochemical analysis, the polymerase chain reaction amplifying omp 1 gene, transmission electron microscopy, and culture methods with histologically atherosclerosis-negative human aortic tissues used as a control group. Chlamydial lipopolysaccharide and C. pneumoniae specific antigens were found by immunohistochemistry in 12 and 8 of 12 aneurysm specimens, respectively, and C. pneumoniae DNA could be demonstrated in 6 of 6 aneurysm specimens studied. Furthermore electron microscopy revealed the presence of Chlamydia-like elementary bodies in three of four aneurysm specimens tested. None of the control samples gave positive reaction in the polymerase chain reaction, and C. pneumoniae antigens were not detected in any of them.\nC. pneumoniae is frequently found in the vessel wall of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The potential etiopathogenetic role of C. pneumoniae in the development of these aneurysms remains to be studied.",

    "abstract": "The geometry of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) reconstruction is a major determinant of carotid bifurcation hemodynamics that, in turn, may play a significant role in the likelihood of early postoperative thrombosis and early and late restenosis. The purpose of this study was to measure the geometry of various types of CEA reconstructions.\nSix carotid artery diameters and lengths were measured during surgery, before and after CEA. Three reconstruction methods were used in 562 CEA procedures: a greater saphenous vein patch in 389, a synthetic patch in 157, and primary closure in 16. Veins 6 mm or more in distended diameter were trimmed before use as a patch. Synthetic patches were 8 to 11 mm in width. Patch reconstruction was used when the length of the arteriotomy required to obtain a complete distal endarterectomy end point extended beyond the internal carotid artery bulb. Saphenous vein patches were used when it was available and adequate. Neither gender nor internal carotid artery diameter was used as a criteria for the selection of the reconstruction method.\nBefore endarterectomy, the 302 male carotid arteries had 7% to 15% greater linear dimensions than the 260 female arteries (p < 0.001). Both vein and synthetic patch reconstruction produced up to 16% changes in linear dimensions except for almost doubling of the length of the internal carotid bulb. Patching made the elliptical common carotid bulb significantly more round, but the maximum diameter of curvature of the carotid bulb remained unchanged. Primary closure slightly decreased the diameter of the internal carotid bulb.\nCEA patch reconstruction has two major effects on carotid geometry: an increase in internal carotid bulb length and a more round common carotid bulb. The former allows for a gradual transition from the terminal common carotid bulb to the uniform diameter more distal internal carotid artery. It also separates the two major causes of disturbed flow: the bifurcation and the step-down in internal carotid artery diameter. Primary closure has minimal effect on preoperative geometry.",

Patients found to be neurologically intact had no further follow-up. Patients with postoperative neuropraxia were entered into regular long-term follow-up to assess delayed recovery.\nTwenty-six (14.2%) nerve injuries were identified in 21 patients. There were 14 recurrent laryngeal, 8 hypoglossal, 2 marginal mandibular, and 2 greater auricular nerve dysfunctions. Two patients were lost to follow-up. Eighteen (9.8%) nerve injuries were transient, whereas two (1.1%) were permanent. Four patients are currently undergoing extended follow-up to assess delayed recovery. Two patients with recurrent laryngeal nerve dysfunction were found to have prolonged full recovery intervals: 20 months and 50 months, respectively.\nThe incidence of focal neuropraxia after carotid endarterectomy is presented. Most injuries are transient. However, permanent injuries can lead to significant disability. Extended follow-up will identify the small subset of patients with delayed complete nerve recovery.",

    "abstract": "Urokinase is used clinically for thrombolysis, but little is known of its direct effect on vascular endothelial cells. The following experiments were preformed to assess the in vitro effects of urokinase on vascular endothelial cell growth, adhesion molecule expression, and interaction with lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and platelets.\nCommercially available human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured with varying concentrations of urokinase (0 to 10,000 IU/ml) (clinical dosage, < or = 500 IU/ml). HUVEC viability was determined from 1 to 4 days. HUVECs were incubated with urokinase (0 to 2000 IU/ml) from 4 to 72 hours. Adherence of 51-chromium-labeled polymorphonuclear leukocytes, platelets, or lymphocytes was then quantitated. In separate experiments HUVEC adhesion molecule expression (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, or endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1) was determined by flow cytometry.\nThere was a decrease of HUVEC viability at suprapharmacologic urokinase concentrations of > or = 2000 IU/ml compared with nontreated control samples (0 IU/ml, 73% +/- 2%, 2000 IU/ml, 60.5% +/- 1.9%, p < 0.05) presumably because of drug toxicity. There was no significantly increased polymorphonuclear leukocyte, lymphocyte, or platelet adhesion to urokinase-treated HUVEC monolayes at any time point. This was also true for each adhesion molecule tested.\nUrokinase at clinically relevant concentrations (< or = 500 IU/ml) did not affect endothelial cell viability or growth, nor did it upregulate adhesion molecule expression or cellular adhesion associated with the cell vascular inflammatory response. It is therefore implied that the use of urokinase in vivo similarly would not initiate the vascular inflammatory response.",

Forty-nine patients (group T) 35 to 45 years of age who had carotid artery stenosis greater than 70%, formed the basis for the analysis. They were compared with two additional groups of patients older than 45 years of age selected from the entire series. Group 2 was randomly chosen to determine differences in risk factors, associated diseases, operative indications, preoperative findings, and outcome. Group 3 was matched with patients in group 1 for sex, risk factors, associated diseases, preoperative findings, and operative indications to assess the importance of age in determining the short- and long-term outcome of CE.\nPostoperative mortality, cerebrovascular accidents, and cardiac complications in patients of group 1 (2%, 2%, and 2%, respectively) were similar to those of the other groups (p = NS). During the follow-up (76.7 +/- 3.6 months; range, 1 to 120 months) the incidence of strokes and transient ischemic attacks in group 1 was lower than in group 2 (p < 0.05) but similar to group 3 (p = NS). Ten-year disease-free intervals were 75.7%, 58.7%, and 77.6%, respectively, for groups 1, 2, and 3. Mortality rate unrelated to cerebrovascular disease was similar between group 1 and group 3 (p = NS) but was higher in group 1 than in group 2 (p < 0.02). Ten-year survival rates were 46.1%, 71.7%, and 55.5%, respectively, for groups 1, 2, and 3.\nCE in patients younger than 45 years of age is a safe procedure with low operative risks and good disease-free intervals.

    "abstract": "The development of intimal hyperplasia is a major cause of early vein graft failure. The study examines the effects of locally delivered antisense oligonucleotides to the proto-oncogene c-myb on the development of vein graft intimal hyperplasia.\nCommon carotid vein bypass grafting procedures were performed on 60 New Zealand White rabbits. Seventeen grafts were controls, 14 had grafts coated with a commercial gel, 17 had grafts coated with gel containing 200 micrograms of an antisense c-myb oligonucleotide, and 6 rabbits each had grafts coated with gel containing one of two control oligonucleotides. Grafts were harvested 28 days after surgery, and sections were taken for dimensional analysis, morphologic evaluation, and vasomotor function. Grafts were also harvested at 1 day for oligonucleotide uptake/localization analysis and at 3 days for c-myb mRNA analysis.\nOligonucleotides were uniformly distributed within the media and adventitia by 1 day. A 38% reduction occurred in mean intimal thickness in the vein grafts coated with antisense to c-myb compared with the other groups. No difference in medial thickness was seen among groups. By scanning and transmission electron microscopy all vein grafts showed a confluent endothelium. In contrast to control vein grafts, which did not relax to acetylcholine, most of the gel and all of the gel/oligonucleotide-coated grafts relaxed by more than 40% of precontracted tension. Responses to a panel of contractile agents were unchanged in the treated groups compared with those in the control group.\nLocally delivered antisense oligonucleotides to proto-oncogene c-myb significantly reduces intimal hyperplasia with preservation of acetylcholine-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation in experimental vein grafts. These findings suggest that targeting a common regulatory pathway of vascular smooth muscle mitogenesis can be successful in reducing the early development of intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "This investigation was designed to test the hypothesis that transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) regulates lysyl oxidase secretion from vascular smooth muscle cells. Lysyl oxidase is an enzyme that catalyzes an essential step in collagen and elastin cross-linking in the extracellular matrix, and TGF-beta 1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of restenosis after vascular injury. The effect of TGF-beta 1 on lysyl oxidase in vascular smooth muscle cells has not been previously defined.\nRat aortic smooth muscle cells were grown in culture to confluence. Cells in passage 2 to 6 were incubated for 24 hours in media containing 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, or 10.0 ng/ml of TGF-beta 1. Lysyl oxidase activity in the media was quantitated with a tritium-release bioassay against an insoluble 3H-labeled aortic clastin substrate. Northern blot analyses were performed to determine steady-state levels of lysyl oxidase mRNA in the smooth muscle cells.\nLysyl oxidase activity in the media increased 1.5-fold above control levels after exposure to 10 ng/ml of TGF-beta 1 (p < 0.01). This increase in lysyl oxidase activity was associated with a concentration-dependent increase in steady-state levels of lysyl oxidase mRNA, being 4.3- and 6.2-fold above control levels after exposure to 1 and 10 ng/ml TGF-beta 1, respectively (p < 0.01). The observed increase in steady-state lysyl oxidase mRNA after exposure to TGF-beta 1 was also time-dependent over the 24-hour experimental period.\nTGF-beta 1 appears to regulate lysyl oxidase in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Increases in lysyl oxidase activity may be one of the mechanisms by which TGF-beta 1 contributes to arterial restenosis after vascular injury.",

    "abstract": "The retroperitoneal approach used in aortic replacement for infrarenal aortic aneurysm has become an important part of the vascular surgeon's armamentarium. Use of the exclusion and bypass technique, however, remains controversial. Although benefits may include reduced blood loss, less operative dissection, and a smoother intraoperative and postoperative course, critics of this technique have alluded to potential drawbacks. In this study the results of the exclusion technique and open endoaneurysmorrhaphy for surgical treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm were compared.\nOne hundred patients were randomized to either exclusion (EXC) or open endoaneurysmorrhaphy (OP) procedures. A posterolateral left retroperitoneal approach was used in all patients. During surgery, autotransfusion devices were used when needed. Doppler flow and pressures in the excluded aneurysm sac were determined during surgery in EXC to evaluate the completeness of the exclusion.\nPatient demographics were similar between the two groups. The mean age was 70 years (range, 53 to 89 years). The operative mortality rates were 0% and 1.9% (1 of 51) in the EXC and OP groups, respectively. Nonfatal postoperative complications occurred in 10.2% (5 of 49) of the EXC group and in 23.5% (12 of 51) of the OP group (p < 0.05). Aneurysm sacs were opened in two EXC procedures. Blood loss (mean +/- SD) was 703 +/- 570 ml in the EXC group and 1031 +/- 703 ml in the OP group (p < or = 0.01). The intensive care unit stay (mean +/- SD) was 1.9 +/- 1.2 days in the EXC group and 3.2 +/- 6.9 days in the OP group (p = NS). The hospital stay (mean +/- SD) was 9.8 +/- 5.8 days and 12.1 +/- 17 days in the EXC and OP groups, respectively (p = NS). There has been persistent flow in the excluded sac in two patients, with sac enlargement in one of these patients on postoperative follow-up by duplex scan or clinical examination.\nThe exclusion and bypass technique for repair of infrarenal aortic aneurysm appeared to be an acceptable technique and was associated with less operative blood loss and fewer postoperative complications than those of open aortic endoaneurysmorrhaphy. Exclusion bypass may contribute to a smoother perioperative course and postoperative treatment of these patients.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a new surgical procedure for interrupting incompetent perforating calf veins in patients with recalcitrant venous ulcers.\nEighteen patients with venous ulcerations in 26 limbs had incompetent perforators diagnosed by duplex scanning. All were taken to the operating room, where the fascial defects through which the perforators coursed were obliterated by a \"pursestring\" permanent suture placed on the leg fascia. Follow-up duplex scanning was carried out within 2 weeks of the procedure and every 6 months thereafter. The mean follow-up in this series was 22 months.\nInitial success in obliterating the perforators was noted in 24 (92.3%) of 26 legs. Three subsequent failures occurred within 6 months for a midterm success rate of 80.7%. No wound complications or infections occurred. All ulcers healed within 6 weeks of the procedure (mean, 23 days) in the successfully treated patients.\nMiniincisional ligation of incompetent perforating veins is easy to perform and has very encouraging early results.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of atherosclerotic arterial disease in diabetes mellitus characteristically involves the infragenicular arterial tree including the anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries. The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) is essential in the development of the atherosclerotic lesion. It has long been held that insulin plays a causative role in the formation of the atherosclerotic lesion in diabetes. We studied the role played by insulin in the proliferation of these cells in culture and the interaction of insulin with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1), a factor known for its possible inhibitory effects.\nWe have grown and characterized a line of VSMC harvested from atherosclerotic infragenicular arteries of human subjects undergoing below-knee amputation. The cultures were defined as being of VSMC origin by immunohistochemical staining with alpha-smooth muscle actin. Confluent cultures of passages 4 through 7 were seeded into six well plates at a density of 5000 cells/well. After serum deprivation the cells were exposed to insulin (100 ng/ml) alone or in combination with TGF beta 1 (6 ng/ml).\nOur findings indicate that a 48-hour incubation with insulin augments the proliferation of human infragenicular VSMC, producing a 207% increase in cell number when compared with control cells (11,328 +/- 686, n = 56 vs 3682 +/- 182, n = 87; p < 0.0001). The addition of TGF beta 1 in combination with insulin abolished the accelerated growth rate seen in test groups treated with insulin alone (3614 +/- 247, n = 32 vs 11,328 +/- 686, n = 56; p < 0.0001).\nThese results strongly suggest that insulin is a potent stimulant of human infragenicular VSMC proliferation. The mitogenic effect of insulin is inhibited by TGF beta 1, producing proliferation rates comparable to those observed in control cells incubated with serum-free media.",

    "abstract": "Although it has been widely accepted as the evidence supporting prophylactic carotid endarterectomy, aspects of the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study have left unease among clinicians who must decide which individuals without symptoms should undergo surgery. Additional confusion has been created by the fact that the several large randomized trials investigating the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy have classified and analyzed different categories of carotid stenosis. In an effort to provide more information on the natural history of asymptomatic, moderate carotid artery stenosis (50% to 79%), we have reviewed data on approximately 500 arteries.\nRecords of our vascular laboratory from 1990 to 1992 were reviewed. We identified 425 patients with asymptomatic, moderate carotid artery stenosis; 71 patients had bilateral stenoses in this category, resulting in 496 arteries for study.\nThe mean length of follow-up was 38 +/- 18 months. New ipsilateral strokes occurred in 16 (3.8%) patients. New ipsilateral transient ischemic attacks occurred in 25 (5.9%) patients. Documented progression of stenosis occurred in 48 (17%) of the 282 arteries for which a repeat duplex examination was available. Arteries that progressed to > 80% stenosis were significantly more likely to have caused strokes than those that remained in the 50% to 79% range (10.4% vs 2.1%, p < 0.02). Conversely, arteries that remained stable in the degree of stenosis were significantly more likely to have remained asymptomatic than those that progressed (92.7% vs 62.5%, p < 0.001). With life-table analysis the estimated cumulative ipsilateral stroke rate was 0.85% at 1 year, 3.6% at 3 years, and 5.4% at 5 years. The respective estimated cumulative transient ischemic attack rates were 1.9%, 5.5%, and 6.3%. The respective estimated cumulative rates for progression of stenosis were 4.9%, 16.7%, and 26.5%. Life-table comparison of ipsilateral stroke revealed a significantly higher cumulative rate among arteries that progressed in the degree of stenosis than among those that remained stable (p < 0.001).\nBased on the low rate of permanent neurologic events in these cases, prophylactic carotid endarterectomy for the asymptomatic, moderately stenotic internal carotid artery cannot currently be recommended. The only factor that appears to predict increased risk for future stroke is progression of stenosis. Careful follow-up with serial repeat duplex examinations must be performed in these patients. Until there are widely accepted duplex parameters that can provide all clinicians with accurate identification of arteries with narrowing corresponding to 60% stenosis as defined by the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study, all surgeons will need to be aware of specifically how their noninvasive laboratories are deriving their results. For the many laboratories that continue to use the University of Washington criteria, 80% should remain the level above which prophylactic carotid endarterectomy is warranted.",

Documented progression of stenosis occurred in 48 (17%) of the 282 arteries for which a repeat duplex examination was available. Arteries that progressed to > 80% stenosis were significantly more likely to have caused strokes than those that remained in the 50% to 79% range (10.4% vs 2.1%, p < 0.02). Conversely, arteries that remained stable in the degree of stenosis were significantly more likely to have remained asymptomatic than those that progressed (92.7% vs 62.5%, p < 0.001). With life-table analysis the estimated cumulative ipsilateral stroke rate was 0.85% at 1 year, 3.6% at 3 years, and 5.4% at 5 years. The respective estimated cumulative transient ischemic attack rates were 1.9%, 5.5%, and 6.3%. The respective estimated cumulative rates for progression of stenosis were 4.9%, 16.7%, and 26.5%. Life-table comparison of ipsilateral stroke revealed a significantly higher cumulative rate among arteries that progressed in the degree of stenosis than among those that remained stable (p < 0.001).",

    "abstract": "Although anticoagulation therapy for iliofemoral venous thrombosis prevents pulmonary embolism, it is not designed to avoid the postthrombotic syndrome. Mechanical removal of the thrombus in the form of venous thrombectomy should yield better long-term results. The purpose of our study was to analyze the clinical outcome and venous valvular function of limbs 5 to 13 years after iliofemoral venous thrombectomy.\nSeventy-seven lower extremities underwent venous thrombectomy for acute iliofemoral venous thrombosis and were monitored for a mean follow-up of 8 1/2 years (range, 5 to 13 years). Patency of the iliofemoral venous system, competence of the femoral popliteal valves, and clinical signs and symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency were evaluated in each case.\nSubsequent to early perioperative failure, patency remained stable over time at 84%. Valvular competence was preserved in 80% at 5 years; however, it decreased to 56% at 10 years. It is important that more than 90% of the limbs had no symptoms or mild symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency.\nVenous thrombectomy should be considered for primary treatment in selected cases of early iliofemoral venous thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "The purposes of this study were to determine whether available laparoscopic stapling devices could be used to interrupt the diseased human aorta, and to develop a videoscopic technique for retroperitoneal exposure and control of the infrarenal aorta in pigs. Our long-term goal is to develop a minimally invasive approach to the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms by exclusion and extraanatomic bypass.\nTen diseased, formalin-preserved human cadaver aortas underwent stapling using a laparoscopic stapling device. The aortas were then pressurized to superphysiologic levels to assess the integrity of the staple line. Ten swine underwent retroperitoneal video-assisted exploration with control and staple occlusion of the aorta and iliac artery.\nThe staple line was complete and remained intact after pressurization in nine of 10 cadaver aortas, despite the presence of complex calcified disease. One aorta had a 2-mm opening through the staple line. Through the left retroperitoneal approach, the infrarenal aorta and left iliac artery could be dissected and controlled. A modified pledgeted technique used for stapling resulted in hemostasis of the staple line and exclusion of flow without injury to adjacent structures.\nThe diseased human aorta can be occluded using available laparoscopic staplers. These swine experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the retroperitoneal approach for exclusion of infrarenal aortic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Wound infection after carotid endarterectomy is an extremely uncommon complication. This complication occurred in two of our patients in a series of 170 consecutive carotid endarterectomies over the last 3 years. There has been an increased use of prosthetic patch grafts to close carotid endarterectomy sites. However, the presence of infection in the setting of prosthetic graft material poses difficulties in management and may lead to life-threatening complications. Recent strategies for the management of wound infections (in cases where the artery/graft interface is intact) include the use of appropriate antibiotics, repeated wound debridement, and covering the tissue defect or the perigraft area with well-vascularized muscle flap. In this case report the use of sternocleidomastoid muscle flap as a coverage for the infected area is described. The use of sternocleidomastoid muscle flap helped control the infective process and secured the viability of the patched carotid arteries.",

    "abstract": "Forty-one months after we performed bilateral implantation of in vitro endothelialized femoropopliteal bypass grafts in a 69-year-old patient, we obtained a central graft segment for histologic and ultrastructural investigation.\nBefore implantation the grafts were confluently lined with autologous first passage mass cultures of pure cephalic vein endothelial cells. The precoating of the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis was done with fibrinolytically inhibited fibrin glue. Reoperation became necessary because of symptomatic unilateral atherosclerotic lesions located in the center of one of the two in vitro lined grafts. A 21 cm long graft segment was removed and replaced by a new in vitro endothelialized expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft.\nOn scanning electron microscopy a confluently covering mature endothelium was found throughout the whole length of the removed prosthesis. The endothelial identity was confirmed by a positive immunohistochemical CD 34, von Willebrand factor-staining, and the ultrastructural demonstration of Weibel Pallade bodies. The endothelium rested on a collagen IV positive basement membrane. Histologic cross sections revealed uniformly developed subintimal tissue of 1.21 +/- 0.19 mm thickness, which was separated from the intima by a distinct internal elastic membrane. The cells of this cell-rich matrix stained strongly positive for actin. Ultrastructurally, this matrix was dominated by highly contractile myofibroblasts loaded with peripherally located well-developed actin fillaments. A number of these cells also showed signs of secretory cells with a distinct endoplasmic reticulum and a Golgi complex. In areas of atherosclerotic lesions the subendothelial matrix was partially exposed, and the internal elastic membrane had to a certain extent disintegrated. Only in these areas KP-1 and MG-M1 positive foamy macrophages and CD 34 positive capillaries were found. The myofibroblasts of this diseased part of the subintimal tissue contained large lipid vacuoles.\nWe conclude that the confluent in vitro lining of synthetic vascular grafts with pure autologous endothelial cells facilitates graft healing, which may result in a hybrid structure with features of a native vessel.",

To treat an extensive dissection after balloon angioplasty, a 57-year-old man underwent placement of seven adjacent Palmaz stents. At 5-month follow-up, an angiographic and intravascular ultrasound examination revealed four distinct stenotic lesions (> or = 50%) at stent junctions. Intravascular ultrasound images obtained during the initial stent placement were compared with the corresponding images obtained at follow-up. A distinction was made between changes seen at stent junctions and stent edges (n = 8), those seen within each stent (n = 7), and those in the nonstented sections proximally and distally (n = 3). Intravascular ultrasound examination established that both intimal hyperplasia and stent area reduction (stent remodeling) resulted in lumen area reduction. The extent of the changes seen at the stent junctions were greater than that of changes seen within the stents: lumen area reduction, 67% versus 23%; stent area reduction, 26% versus 11%; and intimal hyperplasia, 10.8 versus 3.3 mm2; respectively. Changes in the nonstented sections were minimal (< 2%). The stent edge seen at the adductor canal showed elliptical deformation. Thus there is a higher risk of restenosis at the stent junctions. In addition to intimal hyperplasia, stent remodeling contributes to restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Long-term patency of cryopreserved vascular grafts is determined by maintained cellular and tissue viability, which implies preservation of various biochemical, smooth muscle, and endothelial functions. Therefore, it was investigated whether the presence of fetal calf serum (FCS) in the cryomedium improves the postthaw contractile and endothelial function of human arteries.\nRings from human mesenteric (HMA) and left circumflex coronary arteries (HCA) obtained from organ donors were randomized into three groups and studied either unfrozen or after storage for 3 to 6 weeks at -196 degrees C while suspended in Krebs-Henseleit solution without or with 20% FCS as the vehicles and 1.8 mol/L dimethyl sulfoxide and 0.1 mol/L sucrose as cryoprotecting agents. The samples were slowly frozen to -70 degrees C and then stored in liquid nitrogen. Before use, the tissues were thawed within 3 minutes in a 40 degrees C water bath.\nAfter thawing the sensitivity to various agonists and maximal responses to the endothelium-independent relaxing agent sodium nitroprusside were unchanged. However, after cryopreservation of HMA was performed without and with FCS, maximal contractile responses to noradrenaline were significantly reduced to 10.1 +/- 0.7 gm and 9.9 +/- 0.9 gm compared with 13.3 +/- 0.6 gm in unfrozen HMA (mean +/- SEM, n = 15). After cryopreservation of HCA was performed without and with FCS, maximal contractile responses to prostaglandin F2 alpha (6.9 +/- 0.4 gm in unfrozen HCA) were significantly reduced to 4.3 +/- 0.3 gm and 3.8 +/- 0.2 gm (mean +/- SEM, n = 6). In both types of arteries cryopreservation also attenuated significantly the endothelium-dependent relaxant responses to bradykinin during U46619 (10 nmol/L)-induced tone. In HMA the maximal bradykinin-induced relaxation (85% +/- 4%) was significantly diminished to 29% +/- 7% and 38% +/- 9% after cryopreservation without and with FCS (mean +/- SEM, n = 6). In HCA maximal bradykinin-induced relaxation (88% +/- 4%) was significantly diminished to 26% +/- 10% and 36% +/- 11% after cryopreservation without and with FCS (mean +/- SEM, n = 6). This result was reflected by a marked endothelial denudation in all groups of cryopreserved arteries. Neither functional nor morphologic preservation of the endothelial cell lining was significantly improved by FCS supplementation of the cryomedium.\nCryopreservation diminished contractile and endothelium-dependent relaxant responses of human arteries. The presence of FCS in the cryomedium did not modify these changes.",

    "abstract": "We have previously observed endothelium on two human vascular prostheses explanted under optimal conditions for flow surface preservation. In this study we sought to further verify the hypothesis that endothelialization can occur on clinical grafts and that it can be detected in specimens that have been promptly removed and properly preserved in a timely manner.\nWe studied 29 aortic grafts. Of these, 11 Dacron bypass grafts were in a condition suitable for analysis with light microscopy and immunocytochemistry staining, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy.\nThree grafts had endothelium beyond the pannus, identified by factor VIII/ vWF, Ulex europaeus agglutinin, and collagen IV positivity. Specimen A, a knitted 6-year implant, was preserved by embalming 3 hours after the patient's death and had a firmly attached outer capsule with fibroblasts, collagen, giant cells, and microvessels in the interstices. Specimen B, a woven 18-year implant, was retrieved at reoperation and immediately fixed in 10% formalin; it had no outer capsule and no tissue ingrowth. Specimen C, a woven 7-year implant, was removed and fixed 5 hours after the patient's death; it had a firmly attached outer capsule but no tissue ingrowth beyond the outer portion of the wall.\nThe rapidity with which the specimens were fixed probably enabled identification of endothelium. These findings suggest that endothelialization of synthetic arterial grafts may occur more frequently in human beings than previously recognized.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the contributions of coagulation factors IIa (thrombin) and Xa to small-diameter prosthetic graft thrombogenicity in vivo.\nPreclotted and nonpreclotted (collagen-coated) polyester grafts were studied before and 24 hours after implantation into pig femoral arteries. After incubation of explanted grafts was performed with plasma depleted of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors by barium chloride adsorption (Ba-plasma), graft-associated thrombin activity was determined by radioimmunoassay for fibrinopeptide A. Fibrinopeptide A levels reflect thrombin-mediated fibrin formation. Factor Xa activity was characterized by measuring activation of prothrombin added to Ba-plasma.\nThrombin and factor Xa were associated with the luminal surfaces of preclotted grafts before and 24 hours after implantation. Nonpreclotted grafts had negligible procoagulant activity before implantation. After 24 hours in vivo graft-associated factor Xa activity was similar in both nonpreclotted and preclotted grafts; however, more thrombin was bound to nonpreclotted coated grafts (p < 0.01).\nThe procoagulant activity of small-diameter prosthetic grafts persists for 24 hours after implantation and is attributable not only to graft-associated thrombin but also to de novo thrombin elaboration induced by factor Xa. Moreover, graft-associated procoagulant activity is not dependent on preclotting because it develops on nonpreclotted, collagen-coated grafts as well. Treatment strategies to attenuate graft thrombosis may require the inhibition of both thrombin and factor Xa.",

    "abstract": "Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), an endogenous protease, is a potent inhibitor of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. To determine whether TFPI could be used as an alternative to systemic heparin and dextran in vein bypass grafting procedures, we compared the efficacy of these agents in a blinded trial using a pig model of lower extremity vein bypass grafting.\nYorkshire pigs (60 to 75 kg) were divided into four groups of five each: systemic heparin (5 ml 10(3) U heparin, 50 ml intravenous dextran, and 10 U heparin/ml flush), local heparin (5 ml saline solution, 50 ml intravenous dextran, and 10 U heparin/ml flush), recombinant TFPI (rTFPI) (5 ml saline solution, 50 ml intravenous saline, and rTFPI 90 micrograms/ml flush), and control (5 ml and 50 ml intravenous saline and intravenous phosphate-buffered saline solution flush). The pigs were anesthetized and the lesser saphenous vein was harvested and reversed to construct a bypass from the common femoral artery to the saphenous artery at the hock. Each pig received two intravenous infusions before cross-clamping, and the artery and vein were flushed locally according to the protocol for each treatment group. Coagulation parameters were drawn 30 minutes after cross-clamping. The surgical team was blinded as to the pigs' treatment group throughout the protocol.\nThe time from initial infusion until bypass completion averaged 80 minutes. Conduit patency rates at 7 days were as follows: four of five in the rTFPI group, three of five in the systemic heparin group, one of five in the local heparin group, and zero of five in the control group. The activated partial thromboplastin time was elevated (50.1 +/- 13.8 seconds) with systemic heparin but not in the other groups.\nLocal administration of TFPI prevents thrombosis as effectively as systemic heparin and dextran and is superior to local heparin flush plus dextran (p = 0.02). Thus local TFPI offers an excellent alternative to systemic heparin plus dextran and avoids the risks of systemic anticoagulation.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells produce many biologically important factors that may be used as functional markers, including plasminogen activators and their inhibitors (PAI). PAI-1 is a common peptide with a central role in the balance of thrombosis and fibrinolysis in vivo, and its production by vascular endothelial cells has been demonstrated for many in vitro cell lines.\nThe basal rate of PAI-1 release from cultured human adult endothelial cells was studied in both a well-plate-seeding model and after seeding onto human endarterectomy specimens. The effect of nonspecific stimulation with thrombin on PAI-1 release was examined in well-plate cultures. PAI-1 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nCultured human saphenous endothelial cells release PAI-1 constitutively at a steady rate, which can be increased in the short term by the addition of thrombin.\nAfter seeding onto endarterectomy specimens, seeded endothelial cells release significant amounts of PAI-1, which suggests that they retain functional integrity and may potentially influence thrombosis in vivo after seeding.",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the effect of University of Wisconsin (UW) solution at different temperatures on endothelial and smooth muscle cell function of the human saphenous vein to define the efficacy of UW solution as a preservation solution for saphenous vein conduits.\nSaphenous vein segments from 38 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were examined with an isolated organ bath technique to monitor changes in vessel reactivity.\nEndothelial-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were attenuated after incubation in UW solution at both 4 degrees C and 28 degrees C (p < 0.05, n = 10). In contrast, relaxations to sodium nitroprusside were unchanged after incubation in UW solution at both temperatures (n = 8). The responses to 90 mmol/L KCl were increased at both 4 degrees C and 28 degrees C, respectively. Tyrode's: 27.2% +/- 3.1% and 23.8% +/- 3.0%, UW: 64.7% +/- 8.0% and 73.1% +/- 11% (p < 0.001). In addition, the responses to 5-HT were enhanced at 4 degrees C and 28 degrees C (p < 0.05). In contrast, responses to noradrenaline were enhanced only at 28 degrees C compared with the responses after incubations in Tyrode's solution (p < 0.05, n = 6). Furthermore U46619 (0.3 nmol/L to 1 nmol/L) responses were augmented at 4 degrees C (p < 0.05, n = 7). The potency (pD2) values for each agonist were not significantly different after incubations in UW solution.\nWe conclude that UW solution produces attenuation of acetylcholine relaxations and temperature-dependent increased reactivity of smooth-muscle cell function in the isolated human saphenous vein. These studies document the complex interactions brought about by UW solution on the different components of the vascular wall that need to be elucidated further if this solution is to attain a place in vascular preservation.",

    "abstract": "Local activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) is considered an important aspect of the pathogenesis of intermittent claudication, although concrete mechanisms of their effects on circulatory homeostasis in peripheral atherosclerotic disease remain unclear. This study evaluated the ability of PMNLs to deactivate nitric oxide (NO), a key regulator of regional circulation, as a possible factor determining PMNL involvement into ischemic disorders in patients who have intermittent claudication before and after vascular reconstruction.\nA total of 57 patients who had peripheral occlusive disease in an aortofemoral segment before surgical treatment (group 1) and 65 patients who had similar occlusive lesions and other clinical and demographic data 6 to 12 months after undergoing inflow vascular reconstruction (group 2) were examined. All patients from group 2 had anatomically patent grafts; their satisfaction and level of function after surgical treatment were assessed by a five-point questionnaire. The sex- and age-matched control group included 35 subjects. NO activity was bioassayed by measuring its ability to increase cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) accumulation in rat fetal lung-cultured fibroblasts (RFL-6 cells). The ability of PMNLs to deactivate NO was characterized as the percent decrease in NO-induced cGMP accumulation in RFL-6 cells.\nStimulated PMNLs caused inhibition of the activity of authentic NO; accumulation of cGMP induced by sodium nitroprusside was not affected. PMNLs from patients with peripheral atherosclerotic disease either before or after vascular reconstruction had a more marked capacity of NO inactivating than the cells from healthy subjects. For both groups of patients, levels of PMNL-induced NO deactivation were higher for patients with diabetes, and especially both diabetes and arterial hypertension. For both groups of patients, there was no correlation between levels of PMNL-induced NO deactivation and resting ankle-brachial indexes (ABIs). In contrast, close correlation was revealed between levels of PMNL-induced NO deactivation and postexercise ABIs and percent decrease in resting ABIs after exercise in patients evaluated either before or after surgical treatment.\nThe ability of stimulated PMNLs to deactivate NO is elevated in peripheral occlusive disease and may be implicated in the pathogenesis of intermittent claudication. In patients who underwent successful recanalization of magistral arteries, levels of PMNL-induced NO deactivation remained higher than in control subjects. The increase in the ability of PMNL to deactivate NO positively correlated to ABI decreases after exercise in patients with peripheral occlusive disease either before or after surgical treatment.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to determine the effects of vasopressin and the selective V2-receptor agonist desmopressin on human saphenous veins, with special emphasis on endothelium-mediated responses.\nHuman saphenous vein segments were obtained from 35 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. Paired segments, one normal and the other deendothelized by gentle rubbing, were mounted for isometric recording of tension in organ baths. Concentration-response curves to vasopressin and desmopressin were determined in the presence and in the absence of either the V1-receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr (Me)AVP (10(-6) mol/L), the V1-V2-receptor antagonist desGly-d(CH2)5D-Tyr(Et)ValAVP (10(-6) mol/L), indomethacin (10(-6) mol/L), or NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME, 10(-4) mol/L).\nIn vein rings under resting tension, vasopressin produced concentration-dependent, endothelium-independent contractions with a concentration of vasopressin producing half-maximal contractions (EC50) of 3.44 x 10(-8) mol/L. The vasopressin V1-receptor antagonist (10(-6) mol/L) displaced the control curve to vasopressin 9.86-fold to the right in a parallel manner. In precontracted vein rings previously treated with the V1-antagonist (10(-6) mol/L) vasopressin caused endothelium-dependent relaxations. This relaxation was reduced significantly by indomethacin (10(-6) mol/L) and unaffected by the V1-V2-receptor antagonist (10(-6) mol/L) or by L-NAME (10(-4) mol/L). Desmopressin caused endothelium-dependent relaxations in precontracted vein rings that were inhibited by the mixed V1-V2-receptor antagonist and by indomethacin, but not by the V1-antagonist or by pretreatment with L-NAME.\nThese observations indicate that vasopressin exerts contractile effects on human saphenous vein by V1-receptor stimulation. Vasopressin causes dilatation of human saphenous vein only if V1-receptor blockade is present. This relaxation appears to be mediated by the release of relaxant prostaglandins, probably derived from endothelial cells, and is independent of V2-receptor stimulation or release of nitric oxide. Desmopressin elicits relaxation that is largely dependent on V2-receptor stimulation, which may bring about the release of dilating prostaglandins from the endothelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Aspirin is frequently used after vascular reconstruction to pharmacologically prevent graft occlusion and to suppress the development of myointimal hyperplasia in vascular surgery, but its efficacy is controversial. The purpose of this study was to examine the direct effects of aspirin on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation.\nHuman aortic SMCs were grown to confluence in 96 well plates. 3 x 10(-5) mol/L aspirin was added 24 hours previously and PDGF 10 ng/ml at the beginning of each experiment. Cell proliferation at 48 hours was determined using tritiated thymidine uptake. Supernatant 12-L-hydroxy 5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were measured by competitive enzyme immunoassay.\nAspirin did not change vascular SMC proliferation rates relative to controls (4665 +/- 181 counts per minute [CPM] vs 4749 +/- 155 CPM). However, aspirin pretreatment of PDGF-stimulated vascular SMCs increased proliferation (9408 +/- 237 CPM vs 7283 +/- 283 CPM; p < 0.001). 5,8,10,14-eicosatriynoic acid, a 12-lipoxygenase inhibitor, decreased basal (2037 +/- 181 CPM vs 2306 +/- 158 CPM; p < 0.05) and PDGF-stimulated vascular SMC proliferation (4909 +/- 1089 CPM vs 4310 +/- 1022 CPM; p < 0.001). Aspirin increased supernatant 12-HETE levels and decreased PGE2 levels in both basal and PDGF-stimulated cell cultures.\nAspirin enhances PDGF-stimulated vascular SMC proliferation.

Tobacco smoking is associated with a twofold increase in graft failure within the first year of extremity bypass surgery, but the mechanism is not clearly understood. This study evaluated the effect of nicotine and its major stable metabolite cotinine on vascular SMC proliferation in vitro.\nSMC were harvested from human arteries and grown in culture with standard methods. Cells were seeded at a density of 1.8 x 10(4) cells/well in 24 multiwell dishes and cell cycle-synchronized. Subsequently the SMC were incubated with media containing 0.1% or 15% fetal bovine serum and nicotine or cotinine at concentrations ranging from 10(-9) mol/L to 10(-6) mol/L. Control samples were incubated with corresponding media but without the drugs. SMC proliferation was determined at 4 days with a cell counter. DNA synthesis was assessed at 24 hours with 3H-thymidine uptake. The results were expressed as a percentage change compared with the control samples (mean +/- SEM). Results were analyzed by analysis of variance and t tests.\nIn the presence of serum both nicotine and cotinine at concentrations of 10(-7) and 10(-8) mol/L were mitogenic for SMC in vitro (p < 0.05). A weak mitogenic effect was observed at a low serum concentration for cotinine but not nicotine. Cotinine at a concentration of 10(-9) mol/L, a level seen among passive smokers, was a statistically significant stimulus for DNA synthesis in both minimum serum and serum-supplemented media. At high concentrations both substances were toxic for the cells.\nWe have demonstrated a potential role for nicotine and cotinine in the development of intimal hyperplasia and ultimately failure of the vascular reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of permanent and benign iliac vein occlusion responsible for acute vein thrombosis or chronic symptoms remains controversial. Different methods of reconstruction using a reinforced expanded polytetrafluoroethylene bypass graft associated with an arteriovenous fistula and their intermediate-term results are analyzed.\nEight consecutive patients (six men, two women; mean age, 45.6 years; range, 29 to 70 years) were treated over a period of 38 months for iliac vein obstruction. Three short bypass procedures between the left iliac vein and the right common iliac vein with temporary arteriovenous fistulas were carried out after an iliofemoral (and caval in two cases) venous thrombectomy, which revealed May-Thurner syndrome (n = 1) and a compression of the left common iliac vein by the left hypogastric artery (n = 2). Five long bypass procedures (one femorofemoral, two left common femoral-vena caval, one right superficial femoral-common iliac, and one bifemorocaval) with a definitive arteriovenous fistula were performed for long chronic venous occlusion in four cases (responsible for venous claudication [n = 3], recurrent ulcers [n = 1] and after iatrogenic ligature of the left external iliac vein during total cystectomy with double ureterostomy in one case.\nThere was no evidence of pulmonary embolism, and no deaths were recorded in the perioperative period. Two patients had an early bypass thrombectomy, but one returned with a further graft occlusion. Seven grafts remained patent after a mean follow-up of 19.5 months (range, 10 to 45 months). One successful thrombectomy was necessary during the twenty-third postoperative month.\nReconstruction of iliac veins in case of permanent compression, mostly discovered after venous thrombectomy, or for selected patients with symptomatic benign iliac vein occlusion, is safe and provides good intermediate-term results.",

    "abstract": "Flow fields surrounding a vena cava filter were studied with a noninvasive method of flow visualization to examine the underlying hemodynamic factors that contribute to its function and patency.\nThe photochromic technique was used to measure axial velocity profiles and wall shear stress distributions in a 12F titanium Greenfield filter partially occluded with a simulated volume of entrapped thrombi. These results were compared with similar measurements obtained for an unoccluded filter and with a theoretic prediction of the velocity profile and wall shear stress without a vena cava filter. Shear stress distributions were obtained along the vessel wall and for the partially occluded filter along the surface of the simulated clot.\nThe unoccluded filter was observed to have little effect on the flow field. In the case of the partially occluded filter, the results of these measurements show that caval blood flow is preserved by the creation of an annular region of increased flow around the periphery of the clot. Within this region high shear stresses that develop as a result of the increased flow are observed along the vessel wall and along the surface of the simulated clot. No vortices or turbulence were observed with either the unoccluded or the partially occluded filter.\nThe elevated levels of shear stress may be a factor in the lysis of trapped clots observed in vivo. Although increased shear stress is reported to cause thrombogenesis in an in vivo study in canines, particularly under turbulent flow conditions, the levels of shear measured in this study around the simulated clot were well below such values.",

Reflux at the SPJ was detected by handheld continuous wave Doppler and was confirmed with duplex scans. No other abnormalities were found. Brief conservative treatment and duplex localization of the SPJ preceded its ligation and division.\nAll ulcers healed within 12 weeks, but one in a radiated leg recurred at 9 months. Other complications included two hematomas and one each of ankle edema, superficial wound infection, and sural neuropathy.\nEven isolated lateral leg and ankle ulcers with minimal accessory venous stigmata can be of venous reflux origin.

    "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that ischemia and reperfusion injury may contribute to the cause or nonhealing of venous ulcers, the effects of postural change on the microcirculation of ulcers and on levels of known mediators of reperfusion injury in their venous effluent were studied.\nA standard protocol of stabilization (20 minutes), limb dependency (1 hour), and reelevation (2 hours) was used in 10 patients with venous leg ulcers as proven by clinical history, examination, ankle-brachial pressure index, and light reflective rheography. Superficial blood flow in and around ulcers was repeatedly examined with a new laser-Doppler scanning technique. Blood samples from the saphenous vein or a tributary adjacent to the ulcer before dependency and at 0, 10, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after reelevation were analyzed for tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1RA, IL-1 beta, IL-6, platelet-activating factor, thromboxane B2, leukotriene B4, and P-selectin.\nScans showed a consistent pattern of high ulcer blood flow, which decreased on dependency (p < 0.05) and then returned to baseline levels on reelevation and (in 7 of 10) eventually exceeded initial values. Mediator assays showed that levels of platelet-activating factor, IL-1RA, and IL-6 were significantly higher in resting ulcer venous effluent than in systemic venous samples; the reverse was true for P-selectin. There was no statistically significant change in effluent concentration of any mediator as a function of posture, ulcer size, or healing.\nPostural vasoregulation causes relative ischemia and reperfusion in venous leg ulcers.

    "abstract": "Recent experimental and theoretic studies show that large wall shear stress gradients characterize disturbed flow patterns associated with the location of myointimal hyperplasia, atheroma, or both. Graft-to-artery anastomoses that minimize wall shear stress gradients may reduce the degree of myointimal development and the propensity for thrombosis. This study analyzes the distribution of distal anastomotic wall shear stress gradients for conventional geometries and for the optimized geometry assuming idealized merging of the graft with the artery.\nA validated computational fluid dynamics program was used to solve the transient three-dimensional partial differential equations and auxiliary equations that describe laminar incompressible blood flow. Time-averaged wall shear stresses and wall shear stress gradients were calculated for three distal graft-artery anastomoses: a standard end-to-side, a Taylor patch, and an optimized geometry. The latter was obtained iteratively by minimizing the local wall shear stress gradients and was analyzed under resting and exercise inflow waveforms.\nBoth the standard and Taylor patch anastomoses have relatively high wall shear stress gradients in the regions of the toe and heel. For all flow inputs studied nonuniform hemodynamics in the optimized graft design are largely eliminated, and the time-averaged wall shear stress gradients are greatly reduced throughout the anastomotic zone. At resting flow the Taylor patch produces slightly lower wall shear stress gradients in the anastomotic region than the standard end-to-side anastomosis. The optimized design reduces wall shear stress gradients to almost one half of that of the standard and Taylor patch geometries. At exercise flow wall shear stress gradients almost triple in the standard anastomosis and increase approximately 30% in the Taylor patch. In contrast, the geometrically optimized design is basically independent of the type of flow input waveform in terms of time-averaged wall shear stress gradients and disturbed flow patterns.\nThis study demonstrates that it is possible to design a terminal graft geometry for an end-to-side anastomosis that significantly reduces wall shear stress gradients. If the wall shear stress gradient is confirmed to be a major hemodynamic determinant of intimal hyperplasia and restenosis, these results may point to the design of optimal bypass graft geometries.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the accuracy of color duplex sonography (CDS) compared with anterograde intraarterial digital subtraction angiography in the evaluation of the tibioperoneal arteries in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease.\nFifty consecutive patients with femoropopliteal obstruction were examined immediately before planned percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. All CDS examinations were performed by one observer; the angiograms were interpreted independently by two readers (A1, A2). We compared agreement concerning judgement of the dominant crural artery (suitable for an eventual femorocrural bypass operation) and judgement of the severity of arterial lesions.\nConcerning judgement of the dominant artery, the interobserver agreement between the two readers of the angiograms was better (kappa value, 0.76) than the agreement between CDS versus A1 (0.61) and CDS versus A2 (0.56). However, the differences were not statistically significant. The results were independent (no significant differences in the kappa values) of the following criteria: presence of diabetes; clinical stage of peripheral arterial occlusive disease; kind of femoropopliteal obstruction; and status of the popliteal artery. Concerning the evaluation of the severity of arterial lesions, the kappa values were significantly higher (p < 0.05) for A1 versus A2 (posterior tibial, 0.87; anterior tibial, 0.79; peroneal, 0.52) than for CDS versus A1 (0.51; 0.46; 0.07) and CDS versus A2 (0.35; 0.38; -0.05). The sensitivity of CDS (vs A1 as reference) for detecting a hemodynamically relevant arterial lesion (stenosis or occlusion) was 100% in the posterior tibial artery, 78% in the anterior tibial artery, and 92% in the peroneal artery.\nCompared with intraarterial anterograde digital subtraction angiography, the value of CDS-with its currently used technology-for evaluation of the dominant lower leg artery suitable for an eventual femorocrural bypass operation in patients who have femoropopliteal obstruction is limited. It cannot replace an accurate preoperative angiogram for the routine clinical practice, and its use should be restricted to special cases (such as patients with a history of severe allergic reaction to contrast media or of severely impaired kidney function).

    "abstract": "The role of continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring during carotid endarterectomy was evaluated in this retrospective review.\nWe analyzed data from 902 consecutive carotid endarterectomy procedures performed with vein patch angioplasty. In 591 operations from 1980 to 1988 we did not use intraoperative EEG monitoring or shunting (non-EEG group). Continuous intraoperative EEG monitoring and selective shunting were used in 311 procedures from 1988 to 1994 (EEG group). The patients' mean age was higher in the EEG group (68.8 years; range, 41 to 87 years) than in the non-EEG group (66.2 years; range, 34 to 90 years; p < 0.001). There was also a significantly higher incidence of hypertension (56.2% vs 41.9%) and redo operations (5.4% vs 2.54%) in the EEG group than in the non-EEG group (p < 0.05). The operative technique was identical in both groups. We defined a significant EEG change as a greater than 50% reduction of the amplitude of the faster frequencies, a persistent increase of delta activity, or both.\nIn the EEG group, acute EEG changes occurred in 40 patients (12.8%); 31 (77.5%) unilateral and ipsilateral to the operated carotid artery, and nine (22.5%) bilateral. In five patients (12.5%) the changes correlated with an intraoperative episode of hypotension, and after normal blood pressure was restored the EEG returned to normal. In 35 procedures (87.5%) a carotid shunt was inserted. In 33 of those patients the EEG returned to baseline, in one patient there was a significant improvement, and in one patient the EEG changes persisted. Postoperative hospital strokes occurred in one patient (0.32%) in the EEG group and in 13 patients (2.19%) in the non-EEG group (p < 0.05). All strokes (n = 14) were ipsilateral to the operated carotid artery. Of the 13 strokes in the non-EEG group nine were major and four were minor.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to validate the commonly accepted indicators of risk of ischemic stroke that indicate the necessity for cerebral protection during carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and to examine the efficacy of high-dose thiopentone sodium (thiopental) as a cerebral protection method in patients who are at high risk of intraoperative ischemic stroke.\nIn a prospective study of 37 CEAs performed for symptomatic stenosis > 70%, functional and clinical indicators of risk of ischemic stroke during carotid cross-clamping were identified. Functional indicators of risk were the development of ischemic electro-encephalogram (EEG) changes and stump pressure < 25 mm Hg. Clinical indicators of risk were previous ischemic hemispheric stroke and severe bilateral disease. These indicators were correlated in all patients, some of whom had two or three coexisting indicators of risk. The EEG and stump pressure were monitored continuously during carotid occlusion in all operations. Carotid occlusion times were recorded. Intraluminal shunting was eliminated in favor of high-dose thiopental cerebral protection in all patients. Neurologic outcome was deemed to measure the efficacy of thiopental protection in patients who are identified to be at risk and, hence, in need of cerebral protection. The validity of the indicators used to identify risk of ischemic stroke during CEA was assessed.\nThe absolute stroke risk was found to be 29.7% for the whole group (37 patients) and 57.9% in 19 patients who had commonly accepted indications for protective shunting. The correlation of ischemic EEG changes with stump pressure < 25 mm Hg was only 27.3%, whereas the expected correlation based on well-documented reports in the literature was 100%. The lack of correlation may have been related to the prevention of ischemic EEG changes by thiopental. There were no neurologic deficits in the series.\nThe absence of neurologic deficit in the study indicated that thiopental protection was effective in preventing ischemic stroke in high-risk patients and safely replaced intraluminal shunting.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether rupture and repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm induced activation of phagocyte oxidant burst, reflecting a systemic inflammatory state, when compared with elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.\nBlood samples were harvested from 22 patients with elective AAA and 15 patients with ruptured AAA. Phagocyte oxidant activity was measured in response to a panel of activators with luminol and lucigenin as chemiluminescent substrates. Activity of the complement pathways was measured with plasma levels of C3a des arg.\nElective AAA repair resulted in significant elevation in phagocyte count and oxidative activity after surgery in response to maximal dose phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) when compared with the baseline sample. In patients with ruptured AAA the oxidative activity of phagocytes was significantly increased in response to both unopsonized zymosan (899.8 +/- 192 ruptured vs 300 +/- 40 elective, p < 0.01) and maximal dose PMA (8769 +/- 2011 vs 3508 +/- 382, p < 0.01) compared with elective cases at the initial sampling. Phagocyte priming has occurred by way of two distinct pathways: receptor-mediated (unopsonized zymosan, CR3 receptor) and receptor-independent (PMA, protein kinase c).\nRupture of an AAA resulted in priming of the phagocyte oxidant capacity before operative repair compared with elective AAA. Phagocyte activation is a critical component of the systemic inflammatory response that may contribute to the high incidence of systemic organ dysfunction and death in this patient group.",

    "abstract": "A 6-year-old boy from China presented initially at 2 years of age with a pulsatile mass in his right antecubital fossa. He was not fully evaluated until the age of six years, when pan-angiography and computed axial tomography scan revealed multiple aneurysms of his right brachial artery, right radial artery aneurysms, an infrarenal aortic aneurysm, and a right internal carotid artery aneurysm in the region of the cavernous sinus. The patient underwent uneventful repairs of both the abdominal aortic aneurysm and the multiple aneurysms of the right arm. Pathologic evaluation was significant for medial fibrosis of the arterial wall with decreased and disordered elastin fibers. Review of the previously reported cases in children indicate the upper extremity arteries are involved in 92% of patients, the aortoiliac region in 92% of patients, and the renal/mesenteric vessels in 77% of cases. Lower extremity and cerebrovascular arteries are involved to a lesser extent. Children with peripheral aneurysms should have pan-angiography performed before treatment is begun. Surgical repair in these cases has been excellent.",

On admission the diagnosis of hemophilia A was made for the first time in his life because activated partial thromboplastin time was decreased to 32.3% and factor VIII coagulant activity was 2.1% (normal range 40% to 140%). Recombinant factor VIII supplemental therapy was continued during surgery to maintain his factor VIII level within the normal range. His AAA was operated successfully with bifurcated graft replacement. No unusual bleeding complications occurred during his hospitalization. With proper preparation the patient with AAA and hemophilia A can safely undergo surgical treatment. Three other cases of AAA with hemophilia in the English literature were reviewed, and this is the oldest patient with hemophilia who underwent AAA surgery.",

    "abstract": "We report the surgical treatment of a rare case of true aortic aneurysm in a right-sided aortic arch. A 49-year-old female patient with obstructive respiratory problems demonstrated a true aneurysm with a diameter of 58 mm located at the right-sided aortic arch between the right carotid artery and right subclavian artery. Surgery was successfully performed by replacing the arch including the aneurysm with a prosthetic graft. The positions of true aneurysms in the right-sided aortic arch can be divided into two subtypes: first, the transverse arch between the right carotid artery and right subclavian artery, and second, the base of the subclavian artery, the Kommerell's diverticulum. The region is informative for consideration of the surgical approach toward aneurysms of this entity.",

    "abstract": "A 71-year-old woman had an abdominal aortic disruption as a belted passenger in a motor vehicle accident. The diagnosis was unexpected, and the patient died during surgery. There have been 54 patients operated with this diagnosis since 1953; our patient was the fifty-fifth. This is an unusual injury, because the aorta is well protected in this position. Thoracic aortic injuries are much more common (20 times) than abdominal injuries. The causes are motor vehicle accidents, blows to the abdomen, explosions, and falls. Obstructing lesions such as thrombosis and intimal dissection are the more common presentation. False aneurysms occur occasionally. Free rupture has a very high and immediate mortality rate, and few patients arrive at the hospital alive. Diagnosis can be clinical, based on distal ischemia and neurologic abnormalities, or made with Doppler scanning, ultrasonography, computed tomography, or arteriography. Two thirds present acutely and one third subsequently months or even years after the original injury. Treatment consists of flap suture, thrombectomy, bypass grafting in more extensive injury, or extra-anatomic bypass in the face of severe contamination. Recently, endoluminal stenting has successfully been used, avoiding an abdominal operation completely.",

    "abstract": "A pathologic feature commonly associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms is the presence of variably sized and shaped intraluminal thrombus, which may be fundamental to the disease process. However, the precise role of the intraluminal thrombus in the formation, enlargement, and rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms is unknown. The hypothesis tested in this study was whether there were structural features of aortic thrombi to suggest that it may be involved in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms. We have investigated this hypothesis using a variety of structural and biochemical techniques.\nTests performed were light, transmission, and scanning electron microscopy; fluid permeability measurements; and Western blots.\nIntraluminal thrombus found in abdominal aortic aneurysms is structurally complex and is traversed from the luminal to abluminal surface by a continuous network of interconnected canaliculi. Quantitative microscopic analysis of the thrombus shows cellular penetration for at least 1 cm from the luminal surface of the thrombus. Macro-molecular penetration may be unrestricted throughout the entire thickness of the thrombus. Fibrin deposition occurred throughout the thrombus, whereas fibrin degradation occurred principally at the abluminal surface.\nThese principally structural studies support the hypothesis that the thrombus is a self-sustaining entity that may have significance in the pathophysiologic mechanism of abdominal aortic aneurysms.",

Similar laboratory samples were also obtained from 18 patients who had a rupture of the AAA as their primary symptom soon after onset.\nThe primary correlation between serum PIIINP and AAA diameter was 0.22 (p = 0.01), and that between serum PIIINP and the thickness of the thrombus was 0.49 (p = 0.001). Toward the end of the follow-up, however, the correlation increased to 0.55 (p = 0.002) for serum PIIINP and diameter, but remained at 0.42 (p = 0.02) for serum PIIINP and the thickness of the thrombus. Serum PIIINP values were very high among the 18 patients who had ruptured AAAs.\nAcceleration of AAA growth is reflected in serum PIIINP, and a marked elevation of serum PIIINP during follow-up of a patient with an AAA may predict an approaching rupture event.",

Four patients were evaluated after surgical excision for evidence of tumor recurrence. One patient was evaluated before excision for diagnostic confirmation.\nNo evidence of tumor recurrence was demonstrated in the four patients who had undergone previous CBT excision. One of these patients had increased activity in the pituitary, later confirmed as an enlarged pituitary without evidence of an adenoma with computed tomography. The diagnosis of CBT was confirmed in the patient evaluated before surgery. This patient also had increased activity in the occipital region, confirmed as the site of previous ischemia on computed tomography.\nIndium In-111 pentetreotide scintigraphy is a new innovative method for viewing neuroendocrine tumors.

    "abstract": "The objective was to determine the long-term survival rates of patients who undergo distal arterial bypass surgery and to identify the preoperative factors that are predictive of survival.\nThree hundred fifty-eight consecutive in situ distal leg bypass procedures were performed between July 1986 and December 1995. The relationship between 13 preoperative variables and late survival were determined using both univariate (Kaplan-Meier) and multivariate (Cox regression) statistical techniques.\nThe cumulative survival rates at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years were 86.6% +/- 2.0%, 63.2% +/- 3.0%, 46.9% +/- 3.4%, and 35.3% +/- 3.8%, respectively. Using Cox regression, four significant variables were found to be associated with lower late survival rates: male gender, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency (patients with creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.7 mg/dl or 150 SI units), and a history of cerebrovascular disease (p < 0.001 for model). When none of these four variables were present, the predicted 5-year survival rate was 71%, whereas the survival rate was reduced to 43% to 60% when one was present, 23% to 42% when two were present, 8% to 22% when three were present, and 2% when all four were present.\nThis study defines the long-term survival rates in a cohort of patients after undergoing distal bypass surgery and demonstrates that certain preoperative factors are predictive of late survival. Knowledge of these factors may be useful to assist in individual operative decisions between aggressive attempts at distal revascularization versus primary amputation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the physiologic effects of cigarette smoke exposure and dietary cholesterol on the availability of nitric oxide in aortic vascular rings.\nFour groups of New Zealand White rabbits were placed in an air flow chamber for 3 hours per day for 8 weeks. Two of these groups were exposed to smoke from 600 cigarettes per day 5 days a week added to the chamber inflow by a robotic smoke generator. One of these groups was made hypercholesterolemic by being fed a 0.3% cholesterol diet. Two groups of rabbits were similarly placed in the air flow chamber but without smoke exposure, of which one group was also made hypercholesterolemic. After an 8-week period, the rabbits were killed and the infrarenal aortas were excised. The vessels were cut into 3 mm rings and suspended from tension transducers. The rings were contracted with potassium chloride to determine vessel integrity. Then one ring from each aorta was maximally contracted with norepinephrine, and the experimental ring was contracted to 50% of maximum. Relaxation of the rings in response to incremental doses of acetylcholine was measured.\nNo significant differences were seen in contraction to potassium chloride or norepinephrine in any group. A significant decrease in acetylcholine-mediated relaxation was seen only in the smoke-exposed, cholesterol-fed group.\nEndothelial damage, as measured by acetylcholine-mediated vasorelaxation, occurs in the infrarenal aorta in rabbits that are exposed to both cigarette smoke and elevated dietary cholesterol. Cigarette smoke exposure alone or hypercholesterolemia alone in this model did not result in significant alteration in acetylcholine-mediated vasorelaxation.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in the understanding of the biologic mechanisms of vascular diseases suggest that multifactorial stimulation of the endothelial cell and its subsequent adhesion to leukocytes is a prerequisite to the formation of atherosclerotic and restenotic lesions. As leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction is coordinated by a variety of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), we hypothesized that the expression of certain CAMs is up-regulated in the vasculature of patients who have peripheral vascular disease. In addition, we proposed that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) increases monocyte-endothelial adhesion by means of upregulation of these CAMs.\nUsing immunohistochemical techniques, the expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, and P-selectin was examined in human vascular disease specimens. Normal aortas obtained from the organ retrieval system were studied as control specimens. Adhesion studies between human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) incubated with IGF-1 and purified human blood monocytes labeled with 51chromium were completed. Western blotting and flow cytometry were performed to show CAM expression on IGF-1-treated HUVECs.\nOf the CAMs, ICAM-1, P-selectin, and E-selectin were distinctly increased in diseased specimens when compared with control specimens (p < 0.05). Adhesion studies showed an increase in monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion of as much as 40% to 45% (p < 0.01) over baseline, with peak adherence occurring 4 hours after treatment with IGF-1. IGF-1 increased adherence in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The threshold concentration of IGF-1 that induced increased adhesion was 20 ng/ml, with a maximum effect occurring at 150 ng/ml. This increased adhesion was attenuated by pretreatment with IGF-I receptor antibody, as well as with genistein and herbimycin-A, which are potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Increased adhesion correlated with an increase in the expression of CAMs on the surface of the HUVECs. An additive effect on adhesion was observed between IGF-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and endothelin-1 (ET-1). Finally, immunohistochemical analysis of human vascular disease specimens revealed an increased expression of IGF-1 receptors as compared with control specimens (p < 0.05).\nThese results suggest that IGF-1 may be important in the pathogenesis of peripheral vascular disease by increasing endothelial cell-monocyte adhesion by means of an increase in the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.",

    "abstract": "Early thrombosis of infrainguinal bypass grafts may occur as a result of hypercoagulable states. Major surgical procedures are known to induce a procoagulant state that is manifested in part by reduced endogenous fibrinolytic activity or fibrinolytic shutdown. This study was performed to assess the timing and biologic mechanism of fibrinolytic shutdown after infrainguinal bypass procedures by direct assay of the serologic markers of in vivo fibrinolytic activity.\nTwenty patients underwent infrainguinal bypass procedures under epidural anesthesia. Endogenous fibrinolytic activity was assessed by measurement of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and its naturally occurring inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1). The tPA and PAI-1 antigen (total protein) levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and measurements of in vivo biologic activity were performed using an amidolytic method. Measurements of tPA and PAI-1 were made before surgery, after surgery, and on postoperative days 1, 2, 7, and 30.\nThe mean preoperative PAI-1 activity was 20.6 +/- 1.4 arbitrary units (AU)/ml, which was higher than that of an age-matched population without severe atherosclerosis. PAI-1 activity rose significantly after surgery (29.6 +/- 2.2 AU/ml; p = 0.002) and remained elevated through the second day after surgery. Preoperative tPA activity level was 2.04 +/- 0.59 IU/ml and fell to 0.79 +/- 0.23 IU/ml (p = 0.046) immediately after the bypass procedure. All serologic indicators of fibrinolytic shutdown returned to baseline levels by 72 hours after surgery. No early graft thrombosis or other atherothrombotic complications occurred in these study patients.\nDefective endogenous fibrinolytic activity occurs in the early postoperative period after infrainguinal bypass grafting procedures. Diminished endogenous fibrinolytic activity in these patients appears to be mediated by a combination of reduced tPA activity and significantly increased PAI-1 activity. No practical method is available to directly treat postoperative fibrinolytic shutdown, but postoperative antithrombotic therapy may be useful during this period to prevent early graft occlusion related to a relative hypercoagulable state.",

    "abstract": "To determine the late morphologic appearance of the carotid artery after endarterectomy and to relate the morphologic characteristics to the development of recurrent carotid stenosis and subsequent neurologic symptoms.\nEighty-eight carotid reconstructions (51% included patch angioplasty) in 82 patients were studied 5 or more years after carotid endarterectomy. Duplex color flow imaging was used to determine morphologic characteristics of the carotid endarterectomy site and to document the occurrence, time interval, and progression of recurrent internal carotid artery stenosis. The spatial orientation of recurrent wall thickening, presence of calcium, arterial wall texture, and presence of laminar flow were evaluated. Recurrent stenoses were categorized using standard duplex criteria.\nThe mean duration of follow-up was 99 months (range, 60 to 138 months). Arterial wall calcium was identified in 23% (n = 18), a smooth luminal surface in 57% (n = 46), and laminar flow in 52% (n = 42). Recurrent wall thickening developed in 58 vessels (66%), involving the posterior segment of the vessel in 95%, and anterior, lateral, or medial aspects in 24% (n = 14). Restenosis > 50% diameter reduction occurred in 4% of common carotid arteries (n = 3) and in 15% of internal carotid arteries (n = 13). Ten of the internal carotid artery restenoses occurred after a mean of 76 months (range, 13 to 132 months), and the three remaining patients had asymptomatic occlusions after a mean of 61 months (range, 1 to 96 months). Neurologic events referable to the reconstructed carotid artery occurred in three patients at a mean of 77 months; two were a result of recurrent carotid disease. One symptomatic patient and two asymptomatic patients (3.7%) underwent a second ipsilateral reconstruction for recurrent high-grade stenosis.\nThe carotid artery remains smooth, with laminar flow and without calcification, in the majority of reconstructions that were observed over a long term. There is a low incidence of subsequent ipsilateral neurologic events or significant recurrent stenosis, both of which usually occur late in the postoperative period. This study documents the long-term durability of carotid endarterectomy in providing risk reduction for stroke.",

Arterial wall calcium was identified in 23% (n = 18), a smooth luminal surface in 57% (n = 46), and laminar flow in 52% (n = 42). Recurrent wall thickening developed in 58 vessels (66%), involving the posterior segment of the vessel in 95%, and anterior, lateral, or medial aspects in 24% (n = 14). Restenosis > 50% diameter reduction occurred in 4% of common carotid arteries (n = 3) and in 15% of internal carotid arteries (n = 13). Ten of the internal carotid artery restenoses occurred after a mean of 76 months (range, 13 to 132 months), and the three remaining patients had asymptomatic occlusions after a mean of 61 months (range, 1 to 96 months). Neurologic events referable to the reconstructed carotid artery occurred in three patients at a mean of 77 months; two were a result of recurrent carotid disease. One symptomatic patient and two asymptomatic patients (3.7%) underwent a second ipsilateral reconstruction for recurrent high-grade stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Intimal hyperplasia plagues all types of vascular intervention. Early confluent re-endothelialization may attenuate the smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferative response. We previously reported that fibroblast growth factor type 1 (FGF-1) and heparin at relative concentrations of 10 ng/ml:250 U/ml delivered in a fibrin glue (FG) suspension can selectively stimulate endothelial cells (EC) and inhibit SMC proliferation in cell culture. This current study evaluates this surface treatment with and without seeded autologous ECs on intimal hyperplasia in a canine carotid artery balloon injury model.\nTwenty-nine adult dogs underwent bilateral balloon injury to a 6 cm segment of their carotid arteries. The injury resulted in a reproducible removal of the intima and 4 to 6 medial lamellae. Nine dogs were used in part I to determine the percent retention of FGF-1 and EC when applied in a FG suspension to the balloon-injured carotid arteries. Part 2 used the remaining 20 dogs to determine the effect of this surface treatment on intimal hyperplasia. In 10 group I dogs, FG (fibrinogen 32.1 mg/ml and thrombin 0.32 U/ml) containing FGF-1 (11 ng/ml) and heparin (250 U/ml) was applied to the luminal surface of one carotid artery, whereas the contralateral carotid artery underwent balloon injury alone. In 10 group II dogs, an identical FG preparation with FGF-1 and heparin was applied to the surface of one carotid artery, whereas the contralateral carotid artery received FG/FGF-1/heparin that also contained autologous ECs (P3; 5 x 10(4) to 10 x 10(4) cells/cm2). Five dogs from both group I and group II were killed at 10 days and the remaining 10 dogs at 30 days. Histologic analysis and computerized morphometric analysis were used to determine intimal and medial thickness and area, percent endothelialization, and medial SMC proliferative rate.\nThere was no measurable neointima in any 10-day dog. There was no difference in neointimal area between the treatments in group I 30-day dogs. There was a significant decrease in maximal neointimal area, intima/media thickness ratio, and intima/media area ratio in group II 30-day dogs that were treated with FG/FGF-1/heparin plus EC. There was an insignificant increase in percent EC coverage and an insignificant decrease in medial SMC proliferative rate in group II 10-day dogs treated with FG/FGF-1/heparin plus EC.\nIn this canine carotid model, FG with FGF-1 and heparin did not induce significant intimal or medial thickening after 10 or 30 days when compared with vessels that were only balloon-injured. The seeding of autologous ECs within the FG/FGF-1/heparin suspension caused a reduction in neointima formation with no concomitant medial thickening 30 days after injury. The use of FG to locally deliver FGF-1 and ECs may have clinical relevance in the inhibition of intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "This study reports the initial and late results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and intravascular stenting for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the iliac arteries.\nThe preprocedural and postprocedural clinical records, arteriograms, segmental limb pressure measurements (ankle-brachial [ABI] and thigh-brachial [TBI] indexes), and pulse volume recordings of 288 patients who underwent PTA and primary stenting of the common iliac (354, 69.4%) and external iliac (156, 30.6%) arteries were reviewed. Initial and late clinical, hemodynamic, and angiographic success were assessed by objective criteria. Data on patients who underwent unsuccessful attempts at iliac stent placement are unavailable; results are not reported on an intent-to-treat basis.\nClinical follow-up data (mean, 11.9 months) are available for 268 of 288 patients (93.1%) and for 394 of 424 limbs (92.9%). The initial success rates, as determined by TBI, ABI, and clinical limb status, were 90.2%, 87.8%, and 74.6%, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of angiographic patency (101 arteries) were 96%, 81%, and 73% at 6, 12, and 24 months. Cumulative patency rates were 84%, 76%, and 57% on the basis of TBI, ABI, and clinical limb status at 24 months. Factors associated with initial success included the need for multiple stents (p = 0.0001), a higher degree of initial stenosis (p = 0.0001), lower severity of baseline ischemia (p = 0.007), younger age (p = 0.0015), and the preprocedural patency of the ipsilateral superficial femoral artery (p = 0.002). A higher degree of initial stenosis (p < 0.001) and superficial femoral artery patency (p = 0.004) were also associated with late success.\nPTA and stenting of the iliac arteries is associated with reasonable angiographic, hemodynamic, and clinical success. The outcome is favorably affected by higher initial severity of stenosis and greater extent of disease, lower severity of baseline ischemia, younger age, and by patency of the ipsilateral superficial femoral artery.",

    "abstract": "Venous thrombosis and inflammation are interrelated. P-selectin contributes to activation of leukocyte-mediated inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesized that the neutralization of P-selectin would decrease vein wall inflammation and thrombosis.\nTwelve baboons underwent infrarenal inferior vena caval balloon occlusion to induce thrombosis. Two groups of four baboons received neutralizing intravenous anti-P-selectin antibody (PSab) GA6 or CY1748 before occlusion and at days 2 and 4. Four baboons received saline control injections. One baboon per group was killed at days 2, 6, and 13, and at 2 months. Analysis included phlebography, ultrasound, gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced magnetic resonance venography (reflecting vein wall inflammation), and histologic, morphometric, and protein evaluation of the vein wall. Thrombus presence or absence was assessed.\nBy day 2 in PSab baboons, vein wall Gd enhancement was decreased in the mid-inferior vena cava and the right iliac vein (p < 0.05; GA6 vs control baboons), normalizing by 2 months. The mid-inferior vena cava revealed fewer neutrophils and total leukocytes in PSab baboons; however, for GA6 in the right iliac vein these decreases were not present despite the absence of Gd enhancement; they were decreased with CY1748. PSab baboons demonstrated significantly less thrombus than control baboons (p < 0.01, GA6 and CY1748 vs control baboons).\nAnti-P-selectin antibody decreases vein wall inflammation and thrombus formation. Inhibition of P-selectin may be useful in venous thrombosis prophylaxis.",

    "abstract": "We report our approach to the management of postcatheterization femoral artery pseudoaneurysms and arteriovenous fistulae in an attempt to determine the frequency of spontaneous resolution of selected lesions.\nWe studied 196 pseudoaneurysms, 81 arteriovenous fistulae, and 9 combined lesions that were identified by duplex scan. Indications for immediate surgical repair included pseudoaneurysm greater than 3 cm, enlarging hematoma, pain, groin infection, nerve compression, limb ischemia, concomitant surgical procedure, and patient refusal or inability to comply with follow-up. All other lesions were observed.\nOne hundred thirty-nine patients underwent prompt surgical repair, and 147 patients were initially managed without operation. There were no limb-threatening complications associated with nonoperative management in this subset of patients. Eighty-six percent of the lesions being observed resolved spontaneously within a mean of 23 days, whereas 14% required surgical closure for a variety of reasons (at a mean of 111 days after the initial diagnosis). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of spontaneous pseudoaneurysm closure (89%) as opposed to fistulae (81%) (p < 0.17). By life-table analysis, 90% of selected pseudoaneurysms had resolved by 2 months. Patients selected for observation underwent an average of 2.6 duplex scans per patient versus 1.4 scans per patient for those treated with immediate surgery (p < 0.01).\nThe natural history of stable pseudoaneurysms and arteriovenous fistulae is benign and frequently results in spontaneous resolution, which allows properly selected patients to be managed without operation.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is a safe, effective alternative to intravenous heparin (IVH) for deep venous thrombosis. LMWH may also be a safe, effective alternative to IVH when necessary for lower extremity bypass procedures performed with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts. The purpose of this study was to compare subcutaneous LMWH with IVH for perioperative anticoagulation in patients who underwent infrageniculate bypass procedures with PTFE grafts.\nOf 361 lower extremity bypass operations performed at a single center over a 32-month period, 76 were to the tibial or below-knee levels using PTFE grafts for limb salvage. Seven patients were excluded because of absolute indications for perioperative IVH (ventricular thrombus in 1 patient, prosthetic valve in 2, cardiac dysrhythmia in 2, and documented hypercoagulable syndrome in 2), leaving 68 patients (35 women; mean age, 69.8 years) with 69 bypass procedures for study. Grafts completed in the past 16 months were treated with LMWH (28 grafts; Oct. 1994 to Jan. 1996) and were compared with 41 consecutive control grafts from the previous 16-month interval (Apr. 1993 to Oct. 1994) who received IVH. There were similar percentages of composite bypasses (IVH, 50%; LMWH, 46%), patients with tissue loss or gangrene (IVH, 56%; LMWH, 61%), and patients with prior ipsilateral bypass (IVH, 57%; LMWH, 56%) in each group. Age, sex, and atherosclerotic risk factors were also similar between the two groups.\nMorbidity rates (IVH, 19%; LMWH, 11%) and mortality rates (IVH, 2.5%; LMWH, 4%) were not significantly different. There were no significant differences in the number of grafts that failed before discharge (IVH, 1; LMWH, 0) or percentage of hemorrhagic complications (IVH, 15%; LMWH, 7%). The mean number of postoperative hospital days (IVH, 9.5; LMWH, 7.2; p < 0.009) and coagulation monitoring studies (IVH, 22; LMWH, 8.4; p < 0.0001) were significantly decreased in patients who were anticoagulated with LMWH. The mean number of days before conversion to oral anticoagulation (IVH, 7.3; LMWH, 8.0) did not differ significantly.\nWhen perioperative anticoagulation is deemed necessary, LMWH provides a safe, effective alternative to IVH for infrageniculate PTFE bypass grafting procedures. LMWH may reduce the number of postoperative hospital days and coagulation studies by allowing discharge before therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin.",

    "abstract": "The first 5-year review of the Medicare Resource-based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) work values (RVUs) began in 1995, and adjustments became effective January 1, 1997. This report summarizes the methods used by The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery, North American Chapter, (ISCVS-NA) Joint Council Government Relations Committee (GRC) to evaluate vascular surgery work RVUs and the results that were achieved.\nThe GRC performed a work study to determine accurate skin-to-skin operative times for typical vascular and nonvascular operations. These were compared with the original Harvard/Hsiao time estimates and intraservice work per unit time (IWPUT) values that had been used to determine work RVUs. For most vascular procedures the current operative times were longer than the original Harvard estimates, resulting in calculated IWPUTs substantially less than the Harvard values. This lack of correspondence was not identified in the nonvascular procedures, where operating room times and IWPUT values were more consistent with Harvard data. These study results were then used to support compelling evidence arguments in a petition to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) that identified vascular surgery as being undervalued in the RBRVS. Nine commonly performed vascular procedures were cited for review in the 5-year update, and five distinct work analysis methods were used to justify each recommended RVU increase. These techniques included a standardized survey from the American Medical Association (AMA)/Specialty Society Relative Value Update Committee (RUC), a work calculation using accurate intraservice times and appropriate IWPUT values, and an evaluation and management (E&M) building-block approach.\nThe RUC met throughout 1995 to assess codes submitted for review, and recommendations were forwarded to HCFA. The Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM), which contained HCFA's preliminary RVU determinations, was released in May 1996. RVU increases from 11.5% to 44.6% were proposed for the nine vascular services cited by the SVS/ISCVS-NA. Also included were two increases and two reductions in less-common vascular operations. Of far greater overall fiscal import, HCFA proposed substantial increases in the work RVU for all E&M except that performed within global surgical packages. The SVS/ISCVS and most other surgical societies appealed HCFA's proposal regarding E&M. The Final Rule for the 1997 Medicare Fee Schedule was published late in 1996.\nThe Final Rule upheld the 11 vascular work value improvements and the E&M increases that excluded global service packages. Because most surgical E&M is performed within 10- or 90-day global periods, the E&M ruling will produce an estimated annual $2.5 billion shift from surgical to nonsurgical specialties. Because the overall fiscal impact of the 5-year review was mandated to be budget-neutral, HCFA imposed an 8.3% reduction in the work payment of every service in Part B of the Medicare program, primarily to compensate for the increased nonsurgical E&M payments. The net fiscal impact of the 5-year review for vascular surgery has been estimated at +0.5%.",

    "abstract": "Symptomatic cerebrovascular disease is more common in patients who have diabetes mellitus than in the nondiabetic population, even when matched for associated risk factors. Although the safety and efficacy of carotid endarterectomy has been established by NASCET and ACAS, several small studies have noted an increased rate of perioperative neurologic morbidity in patients with diabetes.\nData for all patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy at a single institution from Jan. 1990 to Dec. 1995 were prospectively entered into a computerized vascular registry and form the basis of this report.\nOf 732 carotid endarterectomy procedures performed, 284 (39%) were performed in patients who had diabetes mellitus. Patients with diabetes and without diabetes were matched for clinical presentation (diabetic patients, 45% asymptomatic; nondiabetic patients, 43%) and internal carotid artery percent stenosis (86.6% +/- 10.6% vs 86.4% +/- 10.6%). Patients with diabetes were younger at presentation than patients without (68.8 +/- 8.5 years vs 70.9 +/- 8.5 years; p < 0.005) and were more likely to have a history of coronary artery disease (53% vs 45%; p = 0.04). The mean total length of stay was 6.1 days for patients with diabetes and 4.8 days among patients without (p = 0.01). An adverse postoperative cardiac event (myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmia) occurred in nine patients with diabetes (3.2%) and in five nondiabetic patients (1.1%; p < 0.05). By logistic regression analysis, however, diabetes was not an independent risk factor for a postoperative cardiac event (p = 0.28). There were 11 perioperative neurologic events (eight cerebrovascular accidents, three transient ischemic attacks) during the entire period (1.5%), of which six were among diabetic patients (2.1%) and five among nondiabetic patients (1.1%; p = NS). Of the eight cerebrovascular accidents, three occurred in diabetic patients (1.0%) and five in nondiabetic patients (1.1%; p = NS). The total operative mortality rate was 0.3% (diabetic patients, 1 of 284, 0.35%; nondiabetic, 1 of 447, 0.2%).\nPatients with diabetes who undergo carotid endarterectomy are more likely to have coexisting cardiac disease, which may contribute to a higher incidence of postoperative cardiac morbidity. Diabetes mellitus alone, however, is not a risk factor for postoperative cardiac morbidity in patients who undergo carotid surgery. In addition, carotid endarterectomy may be safely performed in patients with diabetes with neurologic morbidity and mortality rates that are comparable with those of the nondiabetic population",

There were 11 perioperative neurologic events (eight cerebrovascular accidents, three transient ischemic attacks) during the entire period (1.5%), of which six were among diabetic patients (2.1%) and five among nondiabetic patients (1.1%; p = NS). Of the eight cerebrovascular accidents, three occurred in diabetic patients (1.0%) and five in nondiabetic patients (1.1%; p = NS). The total operative mortality rate was 0.3% (diabetic patients, 1 of 284, 0.35%; nondiabetic, 1 of 447, 0.2%).",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration is an essential feature of the intimal hyperplastic process that so frequently limits the patency of vascular reconstructions. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of a series of integrins, or cell surface receptors that mediate cellular attachment, on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein-induced migration of human SMCs.\nImmunofluorescence staining was used to search for various integrins and subunits on the surface of SMCs derived from human saphenous vein. Chemotaxis and haptotaxis of SMCs to various matrix proteins and PDGF were assayed using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber in the presence or absence of antibodies that blocked the function of these integrins.\nSeveral subunits (beta 1, alpha 2, alpha 5) and one integrin (alpha v beta 3) were identified in saphenous vein SMCs. The beta 1 integrin antibody inhibited chemotaxis to collagen I and IV, laminin, and PDGF. The alpha 2 integrin antibody inhibited collagen I and IV, and laminin-induced chemotaxis. The alpha 5 integrin antibody had no effect on SMC migration. The alpha v beta 3 integrin antibody inhibited chemotaxis to PDGF but not to the ECM proteins.\nIntegrins are necessary for SMC migration induced by PDGF and ECM proteins. The integrin or subunits responsible for facilitating migration varies with the stimulant. Agonists designed to inhibit integrin function might be used to suppress SMC migration and suppress the formation of intimal hyperplasia.",

Subgroup analysis revealed significant associations between functional APCR and total early postoperative thrombotic complications and early graft failure, and between factor V (Leiden) and early cerebrovascular events and late graft thrombosis (p < 0.03).\nFunctional APCR is somewhat more prevalent among general vascular surgical patients than in the general population, but factor V (Leiden) is no more prevalent. APCR is not a prominent cause of thrombotic morbidity in contemporary vascular surgery.

    "abstract": "The multifunctional cytokine, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta), plays an important role in the development of injury-associated intimal hyperplasia (IH). Strategies to suppress local TGF-beta activity may have a clinical potential to prevent restenosis caused by IH. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the local generation of cytotoxic free radicals by light activation of photosensitizer dyes and has been shown to inhibit experimental IH. This study investigated whether PDT-generated free radicals can affect TGF-beta activity in a biologic system using vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs).\nThe release and activation of TGF-beta by injured SMCs in culture was compared between mechanical injury and PDT. Mechanical injury was induced with a rubber policeman, and PDT was performed with the photosensitizer chloroaluminum sulfonated phthalocyanine (5 micrograms/ml) and 675 nm laser light at subtherapeutic 10 J/cm2 and the in vivo therapeutic dose of 100 J/cm2. Cell viability was assessed by the tetrazolium salt conversion assay, and active and total (active + latent) TGF-beta was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the conditioned media of SMCs 24 hours after treatment. Functional TGF-beta activity was assessed by inhibition of endothelial cell mitogenesis.\nBoth forms of injury severely reduced (p < 0.0005) SMC viability to less than 15%. In untreated SMC conditioned media, only 14.5% of the total TGF-beta was active (27.7 +/- 8.7 pg per 1 x 10(5) cells). However, after mechanical injury and PDT with 10 J/cm2, there was a significant increase (p < 0.02) in active TGF-beta (60.1 +/- 10.1 pg and 48.6 +/- 21.0 pg, respectively), despite a total reduction of approximately 50%. In contrast to this result, PDT with 100 J/cm2 did not result in increased levels of active TGF-beta (8.1 +/- 3.5 pg), despite having similar levels of total TGF-beta. Consequently, the conditioned media of SMCs that had 100 J/cm2 PDT did not inhibit endothelial cell mitogenesis as compared with the conditioned media of SMCs with mechanical injury and 10 J/cm2 PDT (p < 0.0002).\nThis report describes two novel findings: (1) injury to SMCs in vitro induces the conversion of biologically latent TGF-beta to active TGF-beta; and (2) the therapeutic PDT dose interferes with this injury activation process. This study substantiates the concept of local cytokine inhibition by PDT in a biologic system and provides new insights into the mechanisms of PDT-mediated inhibition of experimental IH.",

    "abstract": "Clinical studies have revealed that the most important predictor of successful bypass grafting is the origin and quality of the bypass conduit. Attempts at intraoperative evaluation of the hemodynamic properties of the conduit, including assessment of blood flow (Q), pressure gradients (delta P), and resistance (R), have not been useful. This is because each of these parameters measures the characteristics of the graft plus the outflow bed. To date, no specific measurement of the resistive properties of the conduit only is available. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate longitudinal impedance (ZL) as a measure of conduit-specific resistance and to evaluate its potential in predicting the outcome of infrainguinal vascular reconstructions.\nZL was measured during surgery in 73 infrainguinal autologous vein reconstructions performed in 68 patients in two separate institutions over a 21-month period. Vein graft ultrasonic transit time Q and delta P (from proximal to distal anastomosis) were measured at baseline and after maximal peripheral vasodilatation with an intraarterial injection of papaverine 30 mg. Waveforms were recorded for 10 seconds at 200 Hz using a digital acquisition system. R was calculated as proximal mean pressure divided by mean blood flow (Q). After Fourier transformation, ZL was calculated as delta P/Q at each harmonic and total ZL (integral of ZL) was defined as the integral of moduli from 0 to 4 Hz.\nAll hemodynamic variables were significantly affected by papaverine vasodilatation (delta P, 3.9 +/- 0.5 vs 6.3 +/- 0.8 mm Hg; Q, 78.2 +/- 7.0 vs 126 +/- 11 ml/min; R, 134 +/- 17 vs 72.7 +/- 6.2 x 10(3) dyne.sec.cm-5; p < 0.0001), except integral of ZL, which remained constant (31.1 +/- 2.8 vs 30.8 +/- 2.8 x 10(3) dyne.cm-5; p = NS). After follow-up of 1 week to 17 months (median, 5 months), the 1-year primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency rates were 72% +/- 7%, 77% +/- 6%, and 81% +/- 6%, respectively. Using Cox analysis, primary patency was significantly associated with decreased integral of ZL (p = 0.0001), but not with baseline or papaverine-stimulated delta P, Q, delta P/Q, or R integral of ZL > 47 x 10(3) dyne.cm-5 predicted primary failure with 90% positive and negative predictive value.\nIntraoperative measurement of integral of ZL in infrainguinal vein grafts is independent of outflow conditions (that is, does not change with papaverine), and hence describes the resistive properties of the conduit only. In addition, these preliminary data suggest that integral of ZL is predictive of short-term primary patency. integral of ZL is the first available hemodynamic measurement that is conduit-specific and may therefore be a better predictor of graft patency than currently available methods.",

Overall, the primary graft patency rate was 25% at 1 year and 19% at 2 years after thrombolysis. Considering only successfully lysed grafts, the primary patency rate improved to 34% at 1 year and 25% at 2 years. Multivariate analysis revealed that the graft patency rate was substantially better in patients without diabetes and in vein grafts that had been in place for longer than 12 months (p < 0.01). The limb salvage rate was significantly improved by successful thrombolysis (63% at 2 years vs 31% if lysis failed; p < 0.01). The patient survival rate was high-89% 2 years after thrombolysis.\nEven with adjunctive therapy, vein graft thrombolysis is unlikely to yield durable patency overall. However, successful thrombolysis improves limb salvage rates and may be beneficial in patients without diabetes who have mature vein grafts but who do not have options for other autogenous revascularization procedures.",

Peak systolic flow velocity ratios (PSFVRs; velocity within stenosis/velocity proximal to the stenosis) at the stenoses ranged from 2.7 to 10 (mean, 5.5), and ankle-brachial indexes ranged from 0.47 to 0.94 (mean, 0.68) Preoperative arteriograms were obtained and confirmed the isolated stenoses, which radiographically ranged from 20% to 83% diameter reduction (mean, 64%). At the time of surgery the stenotic graft segment was isolated, and simultaneous pressure measurements proximal and distal to the graft stenosis were measured, along with ultrasound transit-time blood flow measurements. Pressure and flow wave forms were recorded for 10 seconds at 200 Hz and were stored on a personal computer-based digital acquisition system. The graft stenoses were then repaired with either a vein patch or short interposition graft, and the hemodynamic measurements were repeated. Fourier transformation of the pressure and flow curves was performed, and the resistance and longitudinal impedance were calculated for each graft segment.\nBefore repair, mean pressure gradients across the stenotic graft segments (delta P) ranged from 1.0 to 74.6 mm Hg (mean, 20.4 mm Hg), and vein graft flow ranged from 4.9 to 140 ml/min (mean, 45.2 ml/min). After repair of the stenotic segments, the mean pressure gradient was decreased to a mean of 1.3 mm Hg, and vein graft flow increased to a mean of 104.8 ml/min. The PSFVR recorded in the vascular laboratory correlated significantly with delta P (r = 0.71; p = 0.01) and allowed prediction of delta P as: delta P = 7.4 (PSFVR) - 19.8. PSFVR also correlated with measured resistance across the stenosis (r = 0.79; p = 0.004). Conversely, the angiographic measurement of stenosis did not correlate significantly with these parameters. The angiographic measurement of stenosis showed a moderate correlation with the PSFVR (r = 0.58; p = 0.046).\nThe PSFVR, as measured in the laboratory, is an accurate and useful indicator of the hemodynamic impact of vein graft stenosis. Revision of stenotic vein graft segments resulted in a significant improvement in graft hemodynamics.",

    "abstract": "Surgical outcome data are generally reported as raw morbidity and mortality rates, which do not necessarily reflect quality of surgical care. The Society for Vascular Surgery has led this area with recommendations by the Ad Hoc Committee on Reporting Standards to establish standardized methods of outcome assessment in vascular surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new method for evaluating the overall quality of surgical care, which includes surgeon, nursing, and hospital system performance. The goal of the method is to identify problem areas in surgical practice that can be targeted for focused improvement to improve outcome.\nA database of more than 9000 general and vascular surgical cases was compiled over a 3-year period. Every postoperative complication was tabulated prospectively by a surgical nurse on a daily basis. Fifty clinically significant complication types specific for vascular surgery patients were identified from a list of 151 postoperative events by a panel of vascular surgeons and were grouped into nine broad categories (vascular, cardiac, pulmonary, etc.). These complications reflect the entire continuum of postoperative care, including surgeon, nursing, and hospital system performance. Each complication type was further stratified into four grades (mild, moderate, severe, death) and assigned a SCOUT severity score from 0 to 100 (0, no complication; 100, death) by the panel of surgeons. For case of data collection and monitoring of outcome, a software program was developed to run on a laptop computer and includes medical history, risk factors, pertinent laboratory data, and the preassigned SCOUT severity scores for measuring outcome. In this study, 170 major vascular procedures performed over the previous 12-month period were prospectively evaluated usig the SCOUT method in an attempt to more easily identify problem areas of practice. In-hospital morbidity and 30-day mortality results were examined.\nOne hundred sixteen postoperative complications were identified in the 170 patients, with an overall morbidity rate of 51% and a 30-day mortality rate of 1.8%. Fifty-three percent of the complications were \"mild\" and required minimal intervention or observation only. Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair was associated with the highest morbidity rate (mean SCOUT score, 384.35), whereas distal extremity bypass grafting had the lowest morbidity rate (mean SCOUT score, 114.4). However, subgroup analysis demonstrated that cardiac events accounted for 52% of the morbidity associated with distal extremity bypass but only 34.7% of the morbidity associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (p < 0.05).\nThe SCOUT score is a new technical quality of care measure that can objectively quantify surgeon and other hospital system-related performance. The SCOUT score allows the surgeon to identify problem areas that can then be targeted for improvement to positively affect outcome.",

    "abstract": "Initiation of hemodialysis frequently requires temporary central venous catheterization, which leads to subsequent venous stenosis in 50% of patients. These lesions severely limit upper extremity dialysis fistula creation. The present study was undertaken to determine whether early cannulation (EC) allowed omission of temporary venous catheterization without affecting perioperative morbidity and long-term graft patency.\nSeventy-nine prosthetic grafts for hemodialysis were placed in 76 patients over a 40-month period. Patients who required hemodialysis between 24 and 72 hours after surgery were assigned to EC. The remaining grafts underwent late cannulation (LC) after postoperative day 14. All grafts were constructed with a 6 mm stretch-expanded polytetrafluoroethylene conduit in the brachial artery-to-axillary vein position. Statistical analysis of cumulative primary patency estimates and patient survival data were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test, patient variables were compared using chi 2 and Fisher's exact test, and multivariate analysis was performed using Cox's proportional hazard model.\nForty-eight patients underwent EC and 31 underwent LC. There were no significant differences regarding age (mean, 61.5 years), history of diabetes, congestive heart failure, hematocrit level (mean, 30%), or presence of peripheral vascular disease. Thrombosis occurred before cannulation in one of 48 ECs (2.0%) and one of 31 LCs (3.2%). There were no episodes of cannulation hemorrhage or wound infection in either group. Cumulative primary patency estimates for EC were 0.89, 0.82, and 0.70 at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. These were not significantly different from the LC estimates of 0.86, 0.78, and 0.74 at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Overall, patients who had a history of peripheral vascular disease had a significantly decreased 12-month patency rate (60% vs 74%; p = 0.05). Central venous catheters were omitted in 47 of 48 EC patients.\nEC of prosthetic dialysis grafts does not increase perioperative morbidity rates or decrease 12-month cumulative primary patency rates.",

    "abstract": "Early results of subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS) were examined. Data on ulcer healing, complications, and costs are presented.\nData were prospectively collected for all patients who underwent SEPS at our institution. A concurrent control group was not available because primary open perforator ligation is no longer performed at our hospital. Preoperative assessment included duplex scanning (valve closure times and perforator mapping), plethysmography, and phlebography. Completeness of therapy was assessed with postoperative duplex mapping of perforating veins. Clinical status was monitored after surgery, and actual costs, including equipment, personnel, and facilities management, are reported.\nEighteen procedures were performed in 15 patients (mean age, 52 years; range, 42 to 65 years). Two patients underwent bilateral SEPS, and one patient underwent a second procedure on the same leg. Active ulceration (class 6) was present in 14 of 18 limbs (78%), recently healed ulcers (class 5) in two of 18 (11%), and lipodermatosclerosis with edema (class 4) in two. Deep venous insufficiency was present in 14 of 18 (78%). The number of perforating veins ligated per leg ranged from 0 to 12 (mean, 4.3). Follow-up ranged from 3 to 64 weeks (mean, 22 weeks). Complete ulcer healing occurred in eight of 14 limbs (57%) at a mean of 14 weeks. Reduction in ulcer size was noted in four of 14 (29%), and two limbs were not improved. There were no new ulcers. Residual perforating veins were noted in four of 18 limbs. None of the limbs with residual perforating veins had complete healing of ulceration. Operating room costs were higher than those associated with limited-incision open perforator ligation ($2570 vs $1883).\nThese preliminary data suggest that when used as part of a treatment plan to correct deep and superficial venous insufficiency SEPS results in a high rate of wound healing, with no recurrent ulceration in this series. Increased operating room costs associated with longer operations and greater disposable expenses will likely be overcome by shortened length of stay and diminished wound complications. These findings emphasize the importance of ligating all incompetent perforating veins, as ulcer healing was never achieved when residual perforating veins were found at follow-up.",

This study was designed to determine whether routine use of an intraoperative autologous transfusion device (Haemonetics Cell Saver [CS]) during elective infrarenal aortic reconstructions is cost-effective ($50,000/QALYs threshold).\nA decision analysis tree was constructed to model all of the complications that are associated with red blood cell replacement during aortic reconstructions for both abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD). It was assumed that a unit of CS return (CSR; 250 ml/unit) equaled a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and that all CS transfusions were necessary. Transfusion requirements (AAA:PRBC = 2.8 +/- 3.2 units, CSB = 3.7 +/- 3.2 units; AIOD:PRBC = 3.1 +/- 3.0 units, CSR = 2.1 +/- 1.7 units) were determined from retrospective review of all elective aortic reconstructions (AAA, N = 63; AIOD, N = 75) from Jan. 1991 to June 1995 in which the CS was used (82.1% of all reconstructions). Risk of allogenic transfusion-related complications (transfusion reaction, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II) and their associated treatment costs (expressed in dollars and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were obtained from the medical literature, institutional audit, and a consensus of physicians.\nRoutine use of the CS during elective infrarenal aortic reconstructions was not cost-effective in our practice. Use during reconstructions for AAA repairs cost $263.75 but added only 0.00218 QALYs, for a rate of $120,794/QALY. Use during reconstructions for AIOD was even more costly at $356.68 and provided even less benefit at 0.00062 QALYs, for a rate of $578,275/QALY. The sensitivity analyses determined that the routine use of the CS would be cost-effective in our practice only for AAA repairs if the incidence of hepatitis C were tenfold greater than the baseline assumption. The model determined that CS was cost-effective if the CSR exceed 5 units during reconstructions for AAA and 6 units during reconstructions for AIOD.\nThe routine use of the CS during elective infrarenal aortic reconstructions is not cost-effective. The use of the device should be reserved for a select group of aortic reconstructions, including those in which cost-effective salvage volumes are anticipated. Alternatively, the CS should be used as a reservoir and activated as a salvage device if significant bleeding is encountered.",

    "abstract": "Because dipyridamole thallium (DT) scanning is a useful predictor of perioperative cardiac events, a positive results of a DT scan is frequently the basis for performing more invasive cardiac evaluation and for consideration for performing coronary revascularization procedures before performing peripheral vascular surgery. The rationale for this approach has been that the treatment of anatomically significant coronary artery disease would lower the risk of performing a subsequent vascular operation. However, the benefit of performing aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic cardiac procedures in such patients remains unproved. To examine this issue, data from patients who underwent coronary angiography because of thallium redistribution were compared with data from matched control subjects who underwent peripheral vascular operations without further cardiac evaluation.\nThe medical records of 70 consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography because of the presence of two or more segments of redistribution on DT scan were reviewed and compared with 70 other patients matched with respect to age, gender, peripheral vascular operation, and number of segments of redistribution on DT scan who did not undergo additional cardiac evaluation.\nDT scans were performed on 934 preoperative peripheral vascular surgery patients to help in the assessment of operative risk. Ischemic responses, defined as two or more segments of redistribution, were observed in 297. Of these, 70 underwent cardiac catheterization and 25 underwent coronary revascularization procedures. Adverse outcomes affected 46% of the coronary angiography group and 44% of the control group (p = NS). Patients who underwent coronary angiography and were considered for myocardial revascularization had fewer cardiac events with a subsequent vascular operation than did the control subjects. However, any possible benefit from invasive cardiac evaluation was offset by the three deaths and two myocardial infarctions (MIs) that complicated the cardiac evaluation. There was no significant difference between the angiography group and the matched control subjects with respect to perioperative nonfatal MI (13% vs 9%), fatal MI (4% vs 3%), late nonfatal MI (16% vs 19%), or late cardiac death (10% vs 13%). In long-term follow-up, MIs occurred later in patients who underwent coronary angiography than the control subjects (p = 0.049), but this difference was not associated with an improvement in the overall survival rate.\nThe risks of extended cardiac evaluation and treatment did not produce any improvement in either the perioperative or the long-term survival rate. For most vascular surgery patients who have a positive result of a DT scan, coronary angiography does not provide any additional useful information.",

Duplex ultrasound examination of the neck demonstrated a short segmental occlusion of the proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) with antegrade flow distal to the occlusion maintained by an anomalous branch of the ICA. Angiography confirmed the findings and suggested that the branch was from the distribution of the occipital artery. The ICA findings were surgically proved, and endarterectomy was successfully performed without complication. This case reinforces the usefulness of duplex ultrasonography of the carotid arteries and is a rare situation in which a completely occluded ICA can be repaired with a good clinical outcome.",

This communication reports a 68-year-old white man who developed generalized cerebral ischemia manifested as confusion, incoherence, disorientation, ataxia, and numerous episodes of syncope daily. A cerebral angiogram revealed bilateral external carotid arteries and left solitary vertebral artery critical stenosis. Transcranial Doppler study demonstrated reduction of cerebral and vertebral-basilar perfusion. However, the patient's EC-IC bypass graft had remained patent since 1985. The patient's recurrent symptoms of global ischemia and syncope resolved after carotid endarterectomy, vein patch external carotid artery, and vertebral-to-common carotid artery transposition. This report reiterates the value of the EC-IC bypass procedure and presents the surgical management of symptomatic external carotid and vertebral artery stenosis in patients after EC-IC bypass procedures.",

    "abstract": "Vena caval thrombosis has posed a surgical therapeutic challenge for many years. Historically, spiral vein grafts and synthetic materials used as prostheses have had variable results. The use of the stent may serve as a more promising alternative when used in the capacity to relieve caval obstruction. A case is reported in which a young woman with Klippel-Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome has exercise intolerance and associated hypotensive cardiovascular collapse caused by inferior vena caval thrombosis. Recanalization of her inferior vena cava was successfully achieved and subsequently maintained through the placement of two Wallstents across the lesion. Although most venous stenting procedures have thus far been used in the treatment of venous obstruction caused by malignancy, inferior vena cava stenting in this patient with inferior vena caval thrombosis and Klippel-Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome suggests that venous stenting might offer an alternative therapeutic modality in treating a broader spectrum of occlusive venous disease.",

The entity was diagnosed with a combination of esophagogastroduodenoscopy and aortography. At exploration, a communication between the proximal anastomosis and the esophagus with otherwise minimal mediastinal contamination was encountered. The anastomosis was replaced with an interposition polytetrafluoroethylene graft, and the esophageal defect was debrided, primarily closed, and reinforced with adjacent old aneurysm wall. There were no postoperative complications, and the patient remains well 18 months after fistula repair.",

By 1 year a spiral computed tomographic study confirmed complete regression of the aneurysm, with mild shortening and angulation of the unsupported body of the aortoiliac endoluminal prosthesis. The case demonstrates a potential of endograft treatment of aortic aneurysms and decribes the changes in prosthesis configuration and position that occurred after implantation.",

    "abstract": "Vascular cells are an important target for gene transfer because of their potential to deliver gene products both locally and systemically. Direct retroviral gene transfer to vascular cells in vivo has been limited by inefficient rates of transduction. We hypothesized that vascular cell transduction efficiency (TE), during short retroviral incubation periods, is significantly improved in vitro and in vivo using centrifugation to increase viral titer. Furthermore, we hypothesized a linear relationship between concentration of viable viral particles (measured as colony-forming units (CFUs)/cell) and retroviral TE during short incubation periods. Cultured rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells (RPAECs), rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RSMCs), and human iliac artery endothelial cells (HIAECs) demonstrated a strong correlation between TE and high concentrations of virus (> 100 CFU/cell) during retroviral incubation periods of 10 to 60 minutes. High titers, and thereby high concentrations, were achieved by centrifugation and resuspension in a fraction of the original volume. Titers was consistently increased tenfold, for a twentyfold increase in concentration by volume. A 20-minute incubation with a Moloney murine leukemia-derived retroviral vector coding for human placental alkaline phosphatase, pLJhpAP, at a concentration of 1150 CFU/cell yielded TEs of 10.6% +/- 0.7%, 40.4% +/- 1.6%, and 15.1% +/- 2.0% for RPAECs, RSMCs, and HIAECs, respectively. A similar effect was shown using the Moloney murine leukemia-derived MFGlacZ retroviral vector, coding for Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase. Increased titer and concentration had no effect on target cell viability, as shown by trypan blue exclusion. Although RSMCs had the most cells transduced in a given incubation period (p < 0.05), RPAECs had the highest replication rate (p < 0.05), suggesting the importance of factors other than cell cycle on retroviral TEs during short, clinically relevant incubation periods. In subsequent in vivo experiments, gene transfer was achieved in the rat carotid artery during a 20-minute incubation period infusing the concentrated pLJhpAP retrovirus after carotid balloon injury. Rats infused with virus 2 days after balloon injury exhibited hpAP activity (0 to 10 cells/section/rat) in the neointima of five out of six rats. Rats infused 4 days after balloon injury exhibited hpAP activity (0 to 25 cells/section/rat) in the media and adventitia of five out of five rats. Control rats that received the balloon injury alone or the balloon injury and unconcentrated retrovirus exhibited zero hpAP activity. We conclude that the TE of retroviral-mediated gene transfer to vascular cells in vitro and in vivo can be improved during short, clinically relevant incubation periods using centrifugation to increase retroviral titer, and thereby concentration of viable viral particles.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of exogenous administration of the antiinflammatory cytokine, recombinant human IL-10 (rhIL-10), on proinflammatory cytokine production (IL-6 and TNF alpha) and pulmonary neutrophil infiltration after acute visceral ischemia-reperfusion.\nTwo hours before 25 minutes of supraceliac aortic occlusion, 80 C57BL/6 mice (20 to 22 g) received an intraperitoneal injection of rhIL-10 (0.2 microgram [n = 20], 2 micrograms [n = 20], 5 micrograms [n = 25], or 20 micrograms [n = 15]), and 16 mice received murine anti-IL-10 IgM 200 micrograms. Twenty-five additional mice underwent visceral ischemia-reperfusion without treatment (controls), and 16 mice underwent laparotomy without aortic occlusion (sham).\nPretreatment with exogenous rhIL-10 resulted in significant reductions in lung neutrophil infiltration with 0.2 microgram, 2 micrograms, and 5 micrograms per mouse of rhIL-10 compared with lung neutrophil levels in control mice that underwent acute visceral ischemia-reperfusion alone (p < 0.05). In addition, serum TNF alpha was detected in 50% of control mice and in 75% of mice that received murine anti-IL-10, but in none of the mice that received rhIL-10 (2 micrograms per mouse) or the mice that underwent sham operative procedures (p < 0.05 by chi 2 analysis).\nExogenous IL-10 limits pulmonary neutrophil recruitment and the appearance of TNF alpha in this model of visceral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Thus the use of exogenous IL-10 may offer a novel therapeutic approach to decrease the complications that are associated with TAAA repair.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration contributes significantly to the hyperplastic response that follows arterial injury. In vitro studies have shown that a number of growth factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins individually stimulate vascular SMC migration. However, after arterial injury, SMCs exist in a complex environment in which they are exposed to many of these proteins simultaneously. The response of SMCs to multiple simultaneous stimuli may differ significantly from their response to any single individual stimulus. In this study, we evaluated the chemotactic response of human vascular SMCs to various combinations of growth factors and ECM proteins.\nHuman saphenous vein SMCs were used for all experiments. Using a 4-hour modified Boyden-chamber assay, we evaluated the effect on SMC chemotaxis of combinations of one of three growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF]-AB, basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF], or epidermal growth factor [EGF]), and one of four ECM proteins (fibronectin, laminin, or collagen type I or IV). A standard fluorimetric assay was used to assess changes in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) in response to the various combinations of growth factors and ECM proteins.\nA simple additive effect was seen between ECM proteins and bFGF or EGF. However, when SMCs were simultaneously exposed to PDGF and ECM proteins, we observed a synergistic increase in chemotaxis. This synergy was evident for all concentrations of collagen type I and IV but only with higher concentrations of fibronectin and laminin. We evaluated whether intracellular calcium may be the signaling pathway through which this synergistic effect is mediated. Although ECM proteins alone did not stimulate a rise in [Ca2+]i, ECM proteins enhanced the early peak in [Ca2+]i induced by PDGF.\nThese data show that PDGF acts synergistically with the ECM proteins to promote SMC migration; this effect appears to be specific for PDGF and was not observed with other growth factors. The mechanism responsible for this phenomenon may be a synergistic increase in [Ca2+]i in SMCs simultaneously exposed to both proteins.",

    "abstract": "Intimal hyperplasia (IH) poses the greatest challenge for vein graft success. This fibroproliferative disorder causes obliterative stenosis and frequent graft occlusion. Although its causes remain poorly understood, it has been proposed that IH begins as a wound-healing response that cascades into a chronic state of unchecked proliferation. In this ultrastructural study, IH development and concomitant cell changes were evaluated in rat vein grafts.\nEpigastric vein-to-femoral artery grafts were placed in Lewis rats using standard microsurgical techniques. At various time points, grafts were harvested and processed for transmission electron microscopic, histologic, and immunohistochemical analyses. The proximal region, which displayed the most marked IH, was assessed for ultrastructural changes.\nOur findings showed: (1) regeneration of the damaged endothelium by cells displaying an activated appearance; (2) early and complete smooth muscle cell death, with subsequent replacement by myofibroblastic cells; (3) extensive and sustained graft infiltration by monocytes/macrophages; and (4) intramural fibrin deposition.\nThe rat vein graft wall was substantially altered after implantation into the arterial circulation. During and after IH development, the cells in the graft did not resemble cells that are present in the nongrafted epigastric vein. Marked cell death, mononuclear cell infiltration, and the presence of myofibroblastic cells suggest a state of aberrant wound healing.",

We hypothesized that blocking monocyte adhesion using a specific monoclonal antibody against VLA-4 may reduce intimal hyperplasia.\nBilateral carotid endarterectomies were performed in eight adult baboons. Among them, five animals received an intravenous bolus injection of anti-VLA-4 antibody (3 mg/kg) during surgery and again after 2 weeks. Three animals underwent bilateral carotid endarterectomies and served as untreated control subjects. Specimens were harvested at 4 weeks and subjected to morphometric analysis, cell proliferation assay, and immunostaining for macrophages.\nAll of the endarterectomized arteries were patent except for one in the treated group. The number of macrophages in the intimal tissues was significantly reduced in the treated arteries compared with that in the control vessels (15.78 +/- 3.05 cells/section versus 33.50 +/- 6.13 cells/section; p < 0.001). The cell proliferation rate was significantly lower (p < 0.001) in the treated vessels (2.88% +/- 1.07%) compared with the control vessels (4.89% +/- 0.77%).

    "abstract": "Autologous veins used as arterial bypass grafts undergo initial loss of the endothelial cell (EC) lining, which is followed by reendothelialization. We characterized the expression of the EC-specific angiogenic mitogen, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in vascular grafts to help elucidate the molecular and cellular events after bypass procedures.\nCephalic vein-femoral artery interposition grafts were placed in mongrel dogs. Vein grafts and arteries were harvested at either 48 hours or 4 weeks after bypass, the total RNA was isolated, and the VEGF mRNA expression was evaluated by Northern blot analysis. Tissue segments from each time period were evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis using anti-VEGF antibodies.\nVEGF mRNA expression in vein grafts as compared with control veins was increased 2.5-fold 48 hours after bypass grafting (p = 0.02) but returned to initial control levels in grafts removed at 4 weeks. Distal arterial segments, which included the anastomotic site without attached vein graft, had a 21.4-fold increase in VEGF expression at 48 hours (p = 0.02) and a 6.6-fold increase at 4 weeks (p < 0.01) as compared with control arterial segments. Vessels subjected to arteriotomy or ischemia alone also demonstrated increased VEGF expression. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed VEGF protein within ECs and smooth muscle cells of the venous bypass graft, with maximal levels observed within intimal hyperplasia at the arterial anastomosis.\nAfter arterial reconstruction procedures using venous conduits, VEGF is significantly increased at 48 hours in the vein graft and arterial anastomosis. VEGF expression in the vein graft normalizes within 4 weeks but remains significantly elevated in the adjacent arterial segment. Increased VEGF production after arterial grafting may facilitate reendothelialization, thus partially accounting for optimal patency rates achieved with autologous vein grafts.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies of grafts implanted in dogs documented a time-dependent increase in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) production that correlated with inner-capsule thickness. The purpose of this study was to identify the cells in vascular grafts that produce PDGF.\nDacron thoracoabdominal grafts were seeded with autologous endothelial cells (ECs), implanted in 11 beagles, and removed after 4 or 20 weeks. ECs and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were cultured from grafts and adjacent aorta, and PDGF in the conditioned media was measured by radioreceptor assay. The PDGF A-chain mRNA level in freshly harvested cells was assessed using reverse transcriptase, followed by polymerase chain reaction, and expressed as a ratio of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signal. Localization of PDGF A-chain and B-chain protein was also examined with immunohistochemical analysis.\nGraft and aortic ECs in primary culture did not produce significantly different amounts of PDGF in 72 hours, averaging 368 +/- 160 and 340 +/- 81 pg/microgram DNA, respectively. Graft SMCs in primary culture produced significantly more PDGF than aortic SMCs (584 +/- 343 and 113 +/- 94 pg/microgram DNA, respectively; p < 0.01). Graft SMC PDGF secretion remained greater than aortic SMC PDGF secretion through at least six cell passages. PDGF A-chain mRNA levels were not significantly different for aortic or graft ECs. The PDGF A-chain mRNA level was significantly higher for graft SMCs than aortic SMCs (2.44 +/- 0.67 and 1.45 +/- 0.57 pg/microgram, respectively; p < 0.03). Immunocytochemical analysis detected PDGF A-chain and B-chain protein in the ECs from both native aorta and graft as well as the subendothelial SMCs in the graft, but not in the SMCs of the native aorta.\nThese results suggest that graft SMCs are functionally altered, producing more PDGF than aortic SMCs. PDGF produced by graft SMCs may contribute to the development of intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Experiments were designed to characterize endothelin receptors in human varicose veins. Three groups of veins were studied: (1) varicose vein (VV) tributaries of the greater saphenous vein from patients who were undergoing vein stripping for primary varicosity; (2) greater saphenous veins (SVs) from the same patients; and (3) greater saphenous veins from patients without varicosity who were undergoing arterial reconstruction (control).\nVeins were either cut into rings and suspended in organ chambers for measurement of isometric force, prepared for receptor binding of membrane proteins, or were prepared for measurement of preproendothelin mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\nEndothelin-1 (10(-11) to 10(-7) mol/L) produced similar concentration-dependent contractions in rings with or without endothelium. Maximal tensions were significantly greater in control veins compared with either SVs or VVs. Sarafotoxin S6c (10(-11) to 3 x 10(-7) mol/L), which is selective for the endothelin-B receptor, also produced concentration-dependent increases in tension in all veins. Sarafotoxin S6c responses in VVs were shifted significantly rightward compared with either SVs or control. Maximal tensions to sarafotoxin S6c also were significantly greater in control veins compared with either SVs or VVs. In receptor binding studies, the number of binding sites as defined by competitive inhibition of 125I-endothelin-1 by endothelin-1 was less in VVs than control veins. Competitive inhibition of 125I-endothelin-1 with endothelin-3 (both A and B receptors) or sarafotoxin S6c (B receptors only) suggests that the difference in receptor number between varicose and nonvaricose veins is attributable to differences in the endothelin-B receptor subtype. Binding affinities were not significantly different for either of the receptor subtypes in all veins studied. Preproendothelin mRNA as quantitated by RT-PCR tended to be higher in VVs compared with either SVs or control veins.\nDecreased contractions to endothelin-1 in both varicose and saphenous veins of patients with primary varicosity may be associated with a decrease in the number of receptors. These receptors may be downregulated in response to increased production of endothelin-1, which is regulated at the transcriptional level.",

The affected limbs of the patients were divided into three groups according to the classification advocated by an International Consensus Committee in 1995: mild CVI with class 2 or 3 (50 limbs); moderate CVI with class 4 (11 limbs); and severe CVI with class 5 or 6 (11 limbs). All of the patients underwent a treadmill walking test, during which NIRS was applied. Oxygenated hemoglobin (OxyHb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (DeoHb) were continuously measured by NIRS during exercise. The ambulatory venous retention index (AVRI) obtained from serial changes in DeoHb was assessed comparatively in the four groups (normal and mild to severe CVI). In addition, 19 limbs in 13 patients were evaluated with air plethysmography for comparison with the data obtained by NIRS.\nTwo distinct patterns of DeoHb change were observed. During exercise, the DeoHb level decreased in the normal group as a result of calf muscle contraction, whereas in the varicose group the DeoHb level rose because of an apparent venous reflux into the calf muscles. AVRI studies demonstrated a significant difference (p < 0.0001) among groups. Although there was no apparent relationship between AVRI and ejection fraction, AVRI showed a significant correlation with the venous filling index (r = 0.61) and a weak correlation with the residual volume fraction (r = 0.41).\nNIRS is useful for accurately assessing ambulatory venous dysfunction in patients with primary varicose veins.",

    "abstract": "Incompetent perforating veins play an important role in the etiologic mechanism of venous ulceration and recurrent varicose veins. The anatomic and functional status of the venous system can be evaluated by duplex ultrasonography. To determine the value of this technique in the identification of competent and incompetent perforating veins, a prospective study was performed.\nIn patients who underwent subfascial exploration for venous ulceration of the lower leg, the preoperative findings of duplex ultrasonography were compared with the findings at surgical exploration.\nIn 20 consecutive patients, 42 incompetent and 8 competent perforating veins were detected by duplex ultrasonography. During operation the location of all 50 perforating veins appeared to be predicted correctly. Eleven additional perforating veins that had not been detected by duplex ultrasonography were found during operation. The sensitivity and specificity of duplex ultrasonography in predicting the site of perforating veins at the medial side of the lower leg in our study were 79.2% and 100%, respectively, for incompetent perforating veins and 82% and 100%, respectively, for competent and incompetent perforating veins.\nThese figures indicate that duplex-guided local exploration of the lower leg in patients with venous ulceration as a result of incompetent perforating veins would miss a substantial number of perforating veins, possibly leading to incomplete healing or recurrent ulceration.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to determine whether early duplex findings predicted restenosis after carotid endarterectomy.\nOne hundred ninety-two symptomatic patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy were studied with color duplex imaging at 1 day and 1 week after surgery to identify minor residual disease (causing < 50% stenosis), arterial kinking, and suture stricture, and to measure the external and luminal diameters of the carotid bulb and distal internal carotid artery. Patients were then observed prospectively with duplex surveillance for a median of 24 months to identify > 50% restenosis.\nTwenty-five stenoses > 50% of the operated carotid artery (13%) were identified, four at 1 day (residual) and 21 at a median follow-up of 6 months (restenosis). On multiple logistic regression analysis, > 50% restenosis was found to be associated with minor day-1 residual stenosis (p = 0.01) and with small luminal diameter of the distal internal carotid artery (p = 0.03) as measured 1 week after carotid endarterectomy. Life table analysis showed restenosis at 24 months to be more common for patients with below-median than patients with above-median carotid bulb external diameter (18% vs 5%, respectively; p = 0.01).\nDuplex scanning within a week of carotid endarterectomy identifies > 50% residual stenosis, in addition to minor residual 25% to 50% stenosis and small carotid dimensions, which are good predictors of > 50% restenosis at 6 months.",

    "abstract": "Vein allografts are an alternative bypass conduit for patients who lack adequate autogenous vein. Animal studies have demonstrated that patency can be augmented by low-dose immunosuppression with azathioprine.\nIn a prospective trial, 40 patients (20 men, 20 women) were randomly assigned to receive (17) or to not receive (23) azathioprine (1 mg/kg/day) after cryopreserved vein allograft bypass grafting. Patients had pain or tissue loss that required bypass grafting to pedal or crural outflow and lacked adequate autogenous saphenous vein. Anti-HLA antibody screens were obtained before and after surgery. Biopsies of allografts were performed at implantation and at all subsequent opportunities. Postoperative physical and vascular laboratory examinations occurred every 3 months.\nDuring the 31-months follow-up interval (mean, 15.7 months) there were 10 deaths (none immunosuppression-related). The primary graft patency rate at 12 months was 13%, and the limb salvage rate was 42%. No significant difference (p > 0.05) was noted between immunosuppressed and control groups for mortality rate, primary graft patency rate, or limb salvage rate. As a predictor of graft failure, positive preoperative anti-HLA antibody screen (8 patients) approached significance (p = 0.09). Of 22 explanted grafts, 13 (59%) had histologic evidence of rejection (six immunosuppressed, seven control). Seven patients who had negative results of preoperative anti-HLA antibody screens converted after surgery, and six patients had positive results of preoperative screens that became more strongly positive.\nVein allograft failure is in part mediated by rejection, which is not eliminated by low-dose azathioprine. Both humoral (antibody) and cellular responses to vein allografts develop. The poor patency rates of vein allograft bypass grafts may be improved by more potent immunosuppression as well as improvement in allograft procurement, preservation, and matching.",

There was no significant difference in the inner diameter, intimal thickness, or intima-to-media height ratios of the arteries or veins after either method of closure.\nRepair of 1 cm incisions in small-diameter arteries and veins with VCS clips results in wound healing as good as that achieved with standard suture closure, when assessed for patency, leakage, degree of narrowing, and intimal reaction. The time required for clip closure is considerably shorter than for suture closure.",

    "abstract": "Local compression has been advocated for the treatment of femoral artery pseudoaneurysms. Although it is effective and has a high success rate, this method bears some limitations; among them are prolonged procedure time, discomfort for patients, and recurrence. As a potent thrombosis-inducing agent, thrombin has been used topically, and occasionally intravascularly, for hemostasis. Pseudoaneurysms with a narrow connecting tract to the native artery may be suitable for treatment with thrombin injection to induce intracavitary coagulation.\nPatients with pseudoaneurysms of the femoral artery were evaluated by ultrasonography. Under ultrasound guidance, an intravenous catheter was introduced percutaneously into the pseudoaneurysm, with the catheter position confirmed by contrast ultrasonography. One thousand units of thrombin dissolved in normal saline solution was then injected slowly into the pseudoaneurysm through the catheter to induce thrombosis. The patients were monitored closely for any adverse effects after thrombin injection.\nA total of five patients with femoral artery pseudoaneurysms were treated with direct percutaneous thrombin injection under ultrasound guidance. Within seconds of thrombin injection thrombus formation was evident, and blood flow in the pseudoaneurysm soon ceased when the thrombosis extended to the connecting tract. All procedures were uneventful and successful. No recurrence was noted during follow-up periods of 1 to 28 months.\nOur initial experience with the small number of patients demonstrates the simplicity, lack of morbidity, and high success rate for ultrasound-guided percutaneous thrombin injection for the treatment of femoral artery pseudoaneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Several randomized trials now have established guidelines regarding patient selection for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) that have been widely accepted but have little relevance unless they are considered in the context of perioperative risk. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of early outcome assessment using a computerized database.\nSince 1989 demographic information and in-hospital results for all surgical procedures performed by the members of our department have been entered into a prospective registry. For the purpose of this report, we have analyzed the stroke and mortality rates for 2228 consecutive CEAs (2046 patients), including 1924 that were performed as isolated operations and 304 that were combined with simultaneous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). This series incidentally contains a total of 153 reoperations for recurrent carotid stenosis.\nThe respective stroke and mortality rates were 0.5% and 1.8% for all isolated CEAs, 4.3% and 5.3% for all CEA-CABG procedures, and 4.6% and 2.0% for carotid reoperations. According to a multivariable statistical model, the composite stroke and mortality rate for isolated CEA was significantly influenced by female gender (p = 0.050), by the urgency of intervention (p = 0.026), and by carotid reoperations (p = 0.024). Gender (p = 0.030) and urgency (p = 0.040) also were associated with differences in the stroke rate alone; furthermore, the incidence of perioperative stroke was higher in conjunction with synthetic patching (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 5.3) and was marginally higher with primary arteriotomy closure (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 9.5) compared with vein patch angioplasty (1.3%). The method used to repair the arteriotomy was the only independent factor that qualified for the multivariable composite stroke and mortality models that were applied to the combined CEA-CABG procedures, but too few patients in this cohort had synthetic patches or primary closure to validate the perceived superiority of vein patching.\nProspective outcome assessment is essential to reconcile the indications for CEA with its actual results, and it may lead incidentally to important observations concerning patient care.",

    "abstract": "The vascular smooth muscle determines the dynamic caliber of the blood vessel and hence is the final effector cell in modulating vasomotor tone. Although considerable information is available regarding the physiologic agonists that induce contraction, less is known about the cellular signaling events that lead to long-lasting contractions or vasospasm. We examined the hypothesis that activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase may be associated with sustained smooth muscle contractions.\nPhysiologic contractile responses were determined in intact bovine carotid artery smooth muscles in a muscle bath. Corresponding signaling events were determined with immunoblots using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies or immunoprecipitation of whole-cell phosphorylated strips of muscle.\nThe tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genestein, significantly inhibited the magnitude of contractions induced by phorbol ester, endothelin, angiotensin, and serotonin. In addition, genestein inhibited the sustained phase of contractions induced by serotonin. Serotonin-induced vascular smooth muscle contractions were temporally associated with an increase in the phosphorylation of MAP kinase.\nThese data suggest that the activation of MAP kinase is associated with sustained vascular smooth muscle contractions. Pharmacologic manipulation of MAP kinase activation may lead to new approaches to treat pathologic circumstances of increased vasomotor tone such as vasospasm.",

The effects of NO were evaluated by adding to the cultures NG-monomethyl arginine (NMMA), an inhibitor of NO synthase, or S-nitrosylated penicillamine, which is a slow-release agent of NO. Proliferation was investigated in the presence of various concentrations of serum, glucose, or both.\nElevated glucose levels (16.5 and 27.7 mmol/L) inhibited endothelial cell migration in a dose-dependent manner compared with cells cultured in the presence of 5.5 mmol/L glucose. Inhibition of migration was also observed when wounded mono-layers cultured in 5.5 mmol/L glucose were treated with S-nitrosylated penicillamine, which generates NO. Inhibition of NO synthase by NMMA prevented the inhibition of migration observed in media containing 27.7 mmol/L glucose. Elevated glucose levels did not affect cell proliferation except in the presence of 20% fetal bovine serum.\nAn elevated glucose level inhibits endothelial cell migration in an in vitro wound model, and the inhibition appears to be mediated by increased levels of NO.",

It is immunoreactive with immunoglobulin G (IgGs) purified from the serum and aortic wall of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. AAAP-40 and MAGP-36 have fibrinogen-like and vitronectin-like motifs. Screening an expression library constructed from human aortic adventitial messenger RNA has resulted in the cloning of three complementary DNAs whose gene products are immunoreactive with immunoglobulin G from patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. Two strongly resemble each other and have been described separately. The purpose of this article is to report the third clone.\nMessenger RNA from a specimen of human aortic aneurysmal adventitia was reverse-transcribed for insertion into the phagemid Uni Zap XR (Stratagene). A strain of Escherichia coli, engineered for expression (XL 1-Blue MFR', Stratagene), was transfected, and rabbit antihuman vitronectin antibody as used to identify positive clones. Sequencing of the positive clones was performed by the Core Laboratories at Columbia University.\nThe hypothetical protein of rAAAP-CL4 (clone 4) shares sequence motifs with known microfibril-associated glycoproteins (MAGPs). The recombinant protein (rAAAP-CL4) is immunoreactive with serum from patients (three of four abdominal aortic aneurysm sera). In addition, similarities have been detected with immunoglobulins of the kappa family and with a protein from cytomegalovirus that is a potential molecular mimic.\nThere may several members of a novel family of human aortic autoantigenic proteins implicated in abdominal aortic aneurysm disease.",

    "abstract": "Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) is a potent mitogen for vascular and other mesenchymal cells in vitro that can induce angiogenesis in vivo. Although heparin has no mitogenic potential of its own, it is an important aFGF cofactor in vitro and may also be capable of stimulating angiogenesis. Because the development of a collateral vasculature in response to ischemia appears to be dependent on angiogenesis, we compared the abilities of aFGF with or without heparin and heparin alone to accelerate angiogenesis in a rat hind limb ischemia model.\nDaily subcutaneous injections of saline solution (1 ml), heparin (0.05 mg), or human recombinant aFGF with or without heparin (1 microgram aFGF, 0.05 mg heparin) were administered into the hind limb region distal to the point of unilateral femoral artery ligation in the rat for the 10 days immediately after vascular occlusion. Angiogenicity was determined by histologic assessment of treatment outcomes.\nHistologic assessment of the number of vessels per microscopic field 10 days after vascular ligation in the fibrofatty tissues distal to the ligation point had the following results: saline solution, 10 +/- 4 vessels; heparin, 13 +/- 4 vessels (p < 0.05 vs saline solution); aFGF, 26 +/- 8 vessels; and aFGF/heparin 36 +/- 8 vessels (aFGF, aFGF/ heparin, p < 0.001 vs saline solution). Similar increases in vascularization were also noted in the skeletal muscle tissues distal to the vascular ligation point. Immunohistochemical analysis for the presence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a marker for mitogenic activity, demonstrated corresponding increases in proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling for each of the treatment groups, expressed as a percentage of total vascular cell nuclei, as follows: saline solution, 7% +/- 2%; heparin, 21% +/- 8% (p < 0.05 vs saline solution); aFGF, 67% +/- 9%; and aFGF/heparin, 83% +/- 5% (aFGF, aFGF/heparin, p < 0.001 vs saline solution).\nThe increased vascularization and mitogenic activity demonstrated by these respective studies suggest that angiogenesis is significantly accelerated by the administration of heparin alone and is accelerated to a greater extent by the administration of aFGF with or without heparin. The aFGF/heparin regimen may represent an optimal means of augmenting collateral vessel growth to relieve ischemia in the clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT), the light activation of photosensitizer dyes for the production of oxygen and other free radical moieties without the generation of heat, has been shown to inhibit the development of experimentally induced intimal hyperplasia. The host response to PDT, a form of vascular injury that results in complete vascular wall cell eradication, is devoid of inflammation and proliferation and promotes favorable vascular wall healing. These effects do not result in intimal hyperplasia and are suggestive of PDT-induced changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM). As a model to better understand the biologic consequences of PDT on the vascular wall matrix proteins, the effect of PDT was studied on the powerful matrix-resident mitogen basic fibroblast factor (bFGF) in vitro.\nPDT (5 to 200 J/cm2, 100 mW/cm2, 675 nm) was used with the photosensitizer chloroaluminum sulfonated phthalocyanine (5 micrograms/ml) to inactivate bFGF in vitro while 100 J/cm2 of irradiation was administered 24 hours after 5 mg/ml of the photosensitizer was used in vivo. PDT was used on bFGF in solution and on endothelial cell-derived ECM. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantitate bFGF in solution after PDT treatment or after extraction from the ECM by collagenase and heparin. Functional activity of matrix-associated bFGF was assessed by smooth muscle cell mitogenesis by 3H-thymidine incorporation. To demonstrate the in vivo relevance of these observations, immunohistochemical analysis of PDT-treated rat carotid arteries was undertaken.\nPDT eliminated detectable levels of bFGF in solution. PDT of ECM significantly reduced matrix-bound bFGF (1.0 +/- 0.6 vs 27.5 +/- 1.3 pg/ml; p < 0.0001). This reduction in bFGF after PDT of the ECM was associated with a decrease in vascular smooth muscle cell mitogenesis (52.4% +/- 4.6%; p < 0.0001) when plated on PDT-treated matrix compared with nontreated matrix. Quantitative replenishment of exogenous bFGF to PDT-treated matrix restored proliferation to baseline levels. PDT of rat carotid arteries demonstrated a loss of bFGF staining compared with control nontreated arteries.\nPDT inactivation of matrix-resident bFGF and possibly other bioactive molecules can provide a mechanism by which PDT suppresses smooth muscle cell proliferation in the vessel wall. This free radical-mediated alteration of matrix may contribute to favorable vascular healing when PDT is used for the inhibition of injury-induced intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "To define the prevalence of popliteal artery occlusion during active plantar flexion in normally active and highly trained young volunteers by measuring plantar flexion force and to assess the force level associated with popliteal artery occlusion.\nEighty-four limbs of 42 healthy subjects were studied. Eighteen subjects were highly trained athletes, and 24 were normally active persons. Plantar flexion was progressively performed in prone position against a scale. Plantar flexion force was measured in kilograms. After determination of the maximum strength (Pmax) of plantar flexion force, the level necessary to occlude the popliteal artery (Poccl) was assessed by continuously monitoring that vessel using color duplex sonography.\nOcclusion of the popliteal artery during plantar flexion was observed in 88.1% of the subjects and 77.4% of the limbs. No significant differences in prevalence were found between athletes and normally active subjects. The popliteal artery occluded at a mean plantar flexion force of 45.1 +/- 11.5 kg, which corresponded with 70.1% +/- 16.8% of the maximum force exerted during the provocation test. Poccl was not significantly different between lower limbs of athletes and nonathletes. Although in lower limbs of athletes the popliteal artery occluded at a significantly lower relative force as compared with normally active subjects (65.6% +/- 17.4% vs 74.5% +/- 17.4% of Pmax; p < 0.02), the difference was a result of two extremely low values found in a female athlete.\nPositional occlusion of the popliteal artery during active plantar flexion is commonly found in young healthy volunteers. Prevalence of the phenomenon depends on the force level exerted during active plantar flexion. Popliteal artery occlusion during active plantar flexion is not more frequent in athletes and occurs at a similar force level than in normally active subjects.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of currently available topical hemostatic agents requires the formation of fibrin generated from circulating blood. Fibrin sealant, which is prepared from high concentrations of thrombin and fibrinogen, has been used in liquid form to promote hemostasis during vascular surgery. In a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled fashion, we evaluated a dry dressing of purified, viral-inactivated human fibrinogen and human thrombin in a large animal model of arterial injury.\nDressings were prepared by application of a layer of lyophilized human fibrin sealant or immunoglobulin G (IgG, control) to a silicone backing material. Six anesthetized female Yorkshire pigs (16 to 27 kg) received bilateral, 4 mm longitudinal femoral arteriotomies after surgical exposure of the arteries. The arteriotomies were not closed. In each animal a fibrin sealant dressing was applied to one artery and a control dressing to the other. Each dressing was secured on the arteriotomy by a mechanical device. After application of the dressings, blood flow was restored to each limb for 1 hour. The compressive device was released for 5 seconds at intervals of 15 minutes to assess hemostasis. Blood flow was measured distal to each arteriotomy with a dual-channel flowmeter to adjust equal bilateral compression.\nBlood loss (mean +/- SEM) was significantly less from the arteriotomy treated with the fibrin-based dressing compared with the control dressing (4.9 +/- 4.0 ml versus 82.3 +/- 11.1 ml; p = 0.0005). Complete hemostasis was achieved at the first 15-minute interval in five of six arteriotomies treated with fibrin sealant and in none of the six control arteriotomies during 1 hour of assessment (p = 0.03). Blood flow through each femoral artery at baseline was the same in both treatment and control arteries (fibrin sealant, 114.2 +/- 17.4 ml/min; control, 106.7 +/- 16.5 ml/min; p = 0.24) and was not significantly different throughout the experiment.\nFibrin-based dressings provide effective hemostasis in a large animal model of arterial injury. Further development of these dressings will address optimal formulation and configuration for clinical use. Our results suggest that fibrin-based dressings will be effective in promotion of hemostasis in arterial bleeding, without compromising blood flow.",

We investigated leukocyte endothelial adhesion in patients who were subjected to short-term venous hypertension.\nTwo groups of patients with venous disease were studied: group 1, varicose veins with skin changes (n = 15); and group 2, varicose veins without skin changes (n = 15). Blood samples were taken from a foot vein before and after standing for 30 minutes to raise the venous pressure in the lower limb, and after lying supine again for 10 minutes. The samples were analyzed for leukocyte surface CD11b and L-selectin (CD62L) expression using a flow cytometer. Plasma-soluble L-selectin was also measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nIn patients with skin changes, median neutrophil CD11b levels fell from 4.66 to 3.83 arbitrary units (p = 0.005, Wilcoxon) after 30 minutes of venous hypertension, Median monocyte CD11b levels fell from 7.65 to 5.8 arbitrary units (p = NS, Wilcoxon) after venous hypertension and then fell further to 5.43 arbitrary units (p = 0.02 vs baseline; Wilcoxon) when the venous hypertension was removed. Neutrophil and monocyte L-selectin levels also fell in response to venous hypertension, remaining low even after venous hypertension was removed. A similar pattern was seen in patients with uncomplicated varicose veins. There was a rise in soluble L-selectin in the plasma of both groups of patients after venous hypertension, reflecting leukocyte adhesion to endothelium. In the group of patients with skin changes the level of soluble L-selectin rose from 695 ng/ml to 836 ng/ml (p = 0.02, Wilcoxon), and in the group without skin changes the rise was from 700 ng/ml to 801 ng/ml (p = 0.02, Wilcoxon).\nVenous hypertension results in sequestration of the more activated population of neutrophils and monocytes in the microcirculation of the leg in patients with venous disease. These cells bind to the endothelium, releasing L-selectin, and do not emerge from the limb when venous hypertension is reversed. These findings do not differ between patients with varicose veins and those with skin changes.",

The number and localization of the perforating veins on the mediodorsal side were compared with the findings during subfascial endoscopy.\nIn 20 patients, preoperative duplex examination showed 46 incompetent and six competent perforating veins. During operation the site of 43 incompetent and all competent perforating veins was confirmed. Five additional perforating veins were found at operation (false-negatives). Postoperative duplex ultrasound scans showed six incompetent perforating veins (four persisting and two recurring perforating veins) in four patients, of which the ulcers did not heal in three.

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) develop as a result of an alteration in the systemic connective tissue metabolism. This might change wall mechanics and diameter, not only in the AAA but also in the rest of the vascular system. This hypothesis was tested by studying the mechanical properties of AAAs as well as the common carotid artery (CCA) in the same patient population.\nAAA and carotid artery stiffness (beta) was studied in 121 individuals (101 men, 20 women) who were admitted for elective repair of AAA. Stiffness (beta) was calculated from diameter and pulsatile diameter change determined noninvasively from an ultrasonic echo-tracking system and blood pressure obtained by the auscultatory method. The results were compared with those of healthy individuals of corresponding age and gender published elsewhere.\nThe stiffness of the AAA was increased in both men and women (p = 0.0001). The increase was more pronounced in women compared with men (p = 0.0003) to a mean of 435% and 189% of the normal predicted values, respectively. In the CCA, the stiffness was increased in men (p = 0.027) and in women (p = 0.0001) to a mean of 131% and 149% of the normal predicted values, respectively. A significant correlation between stiffness in the aneurysm and in the carotid artery was seen (p = 0.0031). The carotid diameter was unchanged in men (p = 0.924) and in women (p = 0.070) if adjusted for the difference in blood pressure between the individuals with AAAs and control subjects. There was no correlation between stiffness and diameter of the aneurysm in men (r = 0.16, p = 0.119) nor in women (r = 0.12, p = 0.598).\nThis investigation demonstrated altered mechanical properties of the aneurysmal wall as well as in the CCA in individuals with AAAs. The normal age- and gender-related differences seen in the healthy aorta and CCA vanished. The results suggest that AAA is a generalized process of the vasculature with focal manifestation in the abdominal aorta.",

Four aneurysms were excluded with a transluminally placed endovascular graft made of a PTFE graft and two Palmaz stents (PTFE-EG), three were excluded with a tantalum-Dacron endovascular graft (TD-EG), and one was surgically treated with a standard PTFE graft (PTFE-Surg).

The mean IAPs after repair with all PTFE-EGs were significantly lower (p < 0.001) than the mean systemic pressures. In addition, the mean IAP reduction was significantly greater (p < 0.005) in the PTFE-EG group than in the TD-EG group.\nAneurysm exclusion with PTFE-EG significantly lowered IAP, did so significantly better than the TD-EG, and approached the IAP reduction obtained by standard repair.

No patient in this study had a history of fever, leukocytosis, or computed tomographic evidence of a periprosthetic fluid collection that was suggestive of infection of the original graft. Endovascular grafts composed of polytetrafluoroethylene and balloon-expandable stents were introduced through a femoral arteriotomy and were placed using over-the-wire techniques under C-arm fluoroscopic guidance.\nEndovascular grafts were successfully inserted in all patients with aortic or iliac anastomotic aneurysms. There were no procedure-related deaths, and complications included one postprocedure wound hematoma and one perioperative myocardial infarction. Graft patency has been maintained for a mean of 16.1 months, with no computed tomographic evidence of aneurysmal enlargement or perigraft leakage.\nEndovascular grafts appear to be a safe and effective technique for excluding some noninfected aortoiliac anastomotic aneurysms in high-risk patients and may become a treatment option in all patients who have clinically significant lesions.",

There were 71 bifurcated grafts and eight straight grafts. The patients were followed-up from 1 to 18 months (mean, 5.7 months). Patient data and events were retrospectively analyzed.\nNo patients was lost to follow-up. There were no surgical conversions. Four patients died after operation (4.8%). Two of them had been considered inoperable by the standard technique. Four patients (4.8%) had pulmonary complications, and three had colonic ischemia (3.7%). Forty-five patients (57%) had postoperative fever, and a transitory thrombocytopenia (10%) developed in eight patients. In 66 patients (83%) the aneurysm was immediately excluded. The exclusion was definitive in 62 (78%). In 17 patients, there were 13 initial and six delayed endoleaks. In two of these patients, the initial endoleak sealed temporarily and resumed after 1 year of follow-up, requiring an additional straight, covered stent. Over all, seven of the leaks were treated successfully by an additional endovascular graft, one leak required a lumbar artery embolization, eight leaks sealed spontaneously, and one leak was untreated. During follow-up, there was no aneurysm rupture. Two patients died of unrelated causes.\nThe Stentor system can safely and effectively exclude AAAs in the short term. Careful follow-up is required to detect any delayed endoleak, and long-term results are awaited to confirm the efficacy of the method in preventing AAA rupture.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether differences in the conduct of individual practices of attending vascular surgeons account for variations in resource use at a university hospital.\nThe practice patterns of six attending vascular surgeons at the University of Michigan Hospital were assessed for patient length of stay (LOS), ancillary service use, and the number of nursing hours required. Included in the study were 1930 hospitalized patients who had one of the 10 most frequently encountered diagnostic related groups (DRGs). Statistical analyses of variables that were thought likely to affect resource use included multiple regression models.\nPatient age, sex, insurance, source of admission (direct admission or transfer admission), surgeon, and DRG category together accounted for 22% of LOS variation, 27.7% of variation in ancillary service use, and 29.4% of variation in nursing hours. In no model did the individual surgeon's practice significantly effect the LOS, ancillary use, or nursing hours. Patients transferred from other hospitals had increased resource use in all models. The DRG category alone explained 20.9% of the variance in LOS, 25.2% of the variation in ancillary service use, and 21.2% of the variance in nursing hours.\nDifferences in the conduct of individual vascular surgeons' practices accounted for less than 1% variation in hospital resource use. The most important influences on resource use were the DRG category and the source of patient admission. Modification of the frequency and manner of accepting transfer patients to vascular surgery services of a university hospital may have a major impact on hospital resource use.",

    "abstract": "A carotid endarterectomy critical pathway (CP) targeting a 3-day postoperative course was introduced in March 1994. This retrospective analysis assesses its impact on operative results, postoperative length of stay (POD), and cost of hospitalization (COH).\nOne hundred eighty-six patients who underwent 201 carotid endarterectomy procedures from Nov. 1992 to Feb. 1994 (Pre-CP; n = 67) and from Apr. 1994 to Jul. 1995 (Post-CP; n = 134) at Johns Hopkins Hospital, a tertiary care referral center, were evaluated.\nThe Pre-CP and Post-CP groups had similar risk factors, postoperative morbidity rates, and mortality rates. Furthermore, they had similar mean POD (Pre-CP, 6.0 +/- 0.5 days; Post-CP, 5.7 +/- 0.6 days; p = 0.79) and COH. However, only 85 of the Post-CP (63%) patients were actually placed on the CP (CP-starters); the mean POD was 3.4 +/- 0.3 days among these CP-starters (p < 0.0001) and 2.8 +/- 0.1 days among the 74 Post-CP patients (55%) that remained on the pathway (CP-finishers; p < 0.0001). The mean COH was reduced from $12,881 (Pre-CP) to $9701 for the CP-starters (p = 0.01) and to $8572 for the CP-finishers (p = 0.0001). However, we found that only 47 of the Pre-CP patients (70%) would have been eligible for the CP, and the mean POD among those cases was 4.2 +/- 0.4 days, which was not different than the mean POD among the CP-starters (p = 0.17). The mean COH of the eligible Pre-CP cases, $9508, was not significantly different from the COH of the CP-starters (p = 0.97).\nThis subset analysis emphasizes the importance of establishing an accurate \"control\" group when studying a CP, because using all of the Pre-CP cases as the \"control\" group in the original analysis, including patients who would not have been candidates for the CP, clearly overstated the beneficial impact of the CP.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to determine whether the implementation of clinical pathways for patients who undergo major vascular procedures in a community hospital would shorten the length of stay and reduce charges when compared with Medicare standards.\nLength of stay, hospital costs, and morbidity, mortality, and readmission rates for the four most common vascular diagnosis-related group (DRG) categories at our institution were compared with Medicare standards. The four categories were DRG 005 (extracranial vascular procedures), DRG 110 (aortic and renal procedures), DRG 478 (leg bypass with comorbidity), and DRG 479 (leg bypass without comorbidity). Between May 1, 1994, and June 30, 1996, 112 patients underwent carotid endarterectomy, 42 patients underwent aortic or renal procedures, and 130 patients underwent lower extremity bypass procedures (68% with comorbidity). Only Medicare patients were included because exact cost/reimbursement data were available. No admissions were excluded.\nThe average length of stay was 1.2 days for DRG 005, 6.9 days for DRG 110, and 3.2 and 2.1 days for DRGs 478 and 479, respectively. The average cost savings when compared with the Medicare reimbursement was $4338 for DRG 005, $7161 for DRG 110, $4108 for DRG 478, and $2313 for DRG 479. Readmission was necessary for 9% of peripheral bypass patients. Ten percent of patients in DRG 005 and 86% of patients in DRG 110 needed intensive care, whereas only 2% of patients who underwent complicated bypass procedures did. Ninety percent of carotid endarterectomy patients and 23% of leg bypass patients were discharged on the first postoperative day. There were two postoperative strokes (2%) after carotid surgery. Thirty-three percent of aortic/renal patients had complications that led to care outside the clinical pathway. Twenty-five percent of leg bypass patients required home care to treat open foot wounds. Total inpatient cost savings were $1,256,000 when compared with Medicare reimbursement.\nClinical pathways significantly improve the length of stay and decrease inpatient charges for major vascular surgical procedures while maintaining high standards of care. Factors that favorably affected the length of stay and hospital charges were outpatient arteriography, same-day admission, early ambulation, physical therapy, home care, use of the intensive care unit on a selective basis, and early discharge. Factors that adversely affected these outcomes were emergency admission, inpatient arteriography, thrombolytic therapy, complications, and the need for dialysis or anticoagulation.",

    "abstract": "The intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) is useful in the treatment of failing hearts. Although most experience with IABPs has been with acute short-term use, the safe duration of therapy and possible complications of long-term IABP use are uncertain. We evaluated the feasibility, management, and complications associated with long-term IABP therapy.\nFifty consecutive patients with 87 IABPs were evaluated retrospectively. All patients had IABP support for greater than 72 hours. Results and complications were evaluated.\nThe mean duration of IABP support was 23.2 days. There were 21 IABP-related complications in 16 patients: (16 ischemic, three infections, two hemorrhage). The rate of complications was 0.13 per patient-week of support. Significant predictors of complications were total days of IABP support (p < 0.0001), use of multiple IABPs (p < 0.0001), and attempted but unsuccessful percutaneous insertions (p < 0.001). Complications led to 14 vascular procedures (five patch angioplasties, four bypass procedures, two major amputations, one fasciotomy, one groin exploration for hemorrhage, and one removal of an infected Dacron patch). Percutaneous removals had a 14% complication rate compared with none after operative removal (p = 0.02). Thirty-two patients survived (64%). Of the survivors, 27 underwent transplant.\nProlonged IABP therapy is feasible and is associated with an acceptable rate of complications. Operative removal is superior to percutaneous removal. Percutaneous removal should be limited to short-term therapy. There is no need for mandatory removal or site rotation based solely on indwelling time.",

    "abstract": "Results from 34 endovascular repairs of abdominal aortic aneurysms are reviewed to identify technical complications and relate them to anatomic and technical features of the operation.\nTwenty-one patients underwent attempted tube graft repair (mean follow-up, 13 months). Thirteen patients underwent placement of a bifurcated graft (mean follow-up, 7.2 months).\nTwenty-five patients (74%) underwent repair without technical complication (16 tube graft and nine bifurcated graft). Of five patients who had tube graft complications, two involved small iliac arteries and resulted in arterial injury. One of these patients needed a femorofemoral bypass procedure, and the other required conversion to standard operation. Two patients had distal leaks associated with the attachment system, and one patient had misplacement of the distal attachment system. The two patients who had leaks were followed-up; one required operation after 7 months, whereas the other leak sealed. The patient who had distal attachment system misplacement had a second endograft placed within the first to provide a distal seal. The four patients who had bifurcated graft complications involved two graft limb stenoses, one managed with a Palmaz stent and the other with balloon angioplasty. The patient treated with balloon angioplasty had graft thrombosis 1 week after the operation, which resulted in the need for a femorofemoral bypass procedure. Another bifurcated graft patient had a graft limb twist, which has resulted in chronic claudication. One patient had placement of a limb too proximal in the common iliac artery with chronic leak, and an open operation was performed 18 months later.\nTechnical complications in this series seem to be associated with short distal necks, small iliac arteries, tortuous iliac arteries, and atherosclerosis at the aortic bifurcation. We believe that experience and understanding of these issues will reduce the risk of these complications in the future.",

    "abstract": "Long-term success of endoluminally placed grafts for exclusion of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) relies on secure fixation at the proximal and distal cuffs and, as such, assumes that the fixation sites will not dilate over time. Data regarding this issue, however, are not yet available. This study was performed to evaluate the region of the proximal anastomosis in patients many years after having undergone conventional AAA repair to determine the potential for late dilatation after placement of an endoluminal device.\nThree hundred forty-six patients underwent repair of an infrarenal AAA at our institution between January 1985 and December 1990. Of 97 eligible living patients, 33 both had their original CT scans available and underwent repeat scanning at a mean of 88.6 +/- 23.8 months (mean +/- SD; range, 40 to 134 months) after repair.\nThe overall 5-year survival rate was 73%. The mean preoperative infrarenal aortic cuff diameter by CT scan was 24.5 +/- 3.7 mm (range, 19 to 33 mm). At an average of 89 months after repair, the mean infrarenal aortic diameter increased 4.3 mm to 28.8 +/- 7.7 mm (range, 20 to 52 mm; p = 0.0004 by t test). The proximal cuff at this time measured 30 mm or more in 11 patients (33%), and as early as 6 years after operation three of the seven patients (43%) scanned within this time period had cuffs that were dilated to 30 mm or more. Late dilatation to 30 mm or more was rare (16%) in patients who had preoperative cuffs that measured 27 mm or less. The mean late iliac artery size was 16.9 +/- 8.9 mm (range, 10 to 52 mm), and 30% (10 of 33) measured 20 mm or more.\nOne third of all patients who survive AAA repair experience significant dilatation of their proximal aortic cuff over time. Proximal dilatation is rare but not absent in patients who have smaller initial aortic cuff diameters. This dilatation rarely causes problems after conventional suture fixation, but the long-term implications of cuff dilatation after endoluminal repair are unclear. Our findings suggest that endovascular aortic prostheses that have the ability to continue to self-expand many years after implantation may be required and that endovascular prostheses may not be the best option for patients who have a long life expectancy or for those who have preoperative proximal cuffs greater than 27 mm.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective review examines the results of atherosclerotic renal artery (RA) repair in consecutive hypertensive African-Americans treated at our center and compares these results with Caucasians treated during the same period.\nFrom Jan. 1987 through Sep. 1996, a total of 485 patients underwent operative RA repair. Of these, 28 African-Americans and 370 Caucasians were managed for atherosclerotic renovascular disease. These cohorts were compared on the basis of preoperative blood pressure and renal function, extent of renal disease, extrarenal atherosclerosis, response to operation, and estimated survival.\nThe African-American cohort included nine men and 19 women (mean age, 62 years) with hypertension (mean blood pressure, 204 +/- 31/109 +/- 20 mm Hg) for an average of 10.2 +/- 7.5 years. Ischemic nephropathy (serum creatinine level, > 1.3 mg/dl) was present in 82% (n = 23) of the African-American group. RA reconstructions were unilateral in nine patients and bilateral in 19 patients (including repair to two solitary kidneys), for a total of 45 RA reconstructions (30 RA bypass procedures; eight transrenal/transaortic RA endarterectomy procedures; two RA reimplantations; five nephrectomies). Nine patients underwent combined aortic procedures (four abdominal aortic aneurysm; five occlusive disease). There was one perioperative death in the African-American group as a result of sepsis and multiple organ failure. Among surgical survivors, 20 African-American patients (74%) had a beneficial hypertension response (7% cured, 67% improved). Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate improved significantly from 34 to 42 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p < 0.001). In the 23 patients with ischemic nephropathy, 13 (57%) demonstrated greater than 20% decrease in serum creatinine level. In comparison with the 370 Caucasians (191 men, 179 women), the African-American cohort had significantly more preoperative heart disease (congestive heart failure or left ventricular hypertrophy; 68% vs 46%; p = 0.03) and tended toward more severe renal dysfunction (mean serum creatinine level, 2.5 vs 2.1 mg/dl; p = 0.25). However, African-Americans demonstrated a beneficial blood pressure and renal function response after operation, similar to Caucasians.\nOur results indicate that the majority of selected African-Americans have a favorable blood pressure and renal function response to operative renal artery repair. This beneficial clinical response appears equivalent to the response observed in Caucasian patients and supports the search for RA disease in hypertensive African-Americans.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of stroke caused by carotid artery stenosis. Limiting the costs of CEA without increasing the risks will improve the cost-effectiveness of this procedure.\nResults were prospectively collected from 63 consecutive CEAs performed in 60 patients who were entered into a clinical pathway for CEA that included avoidance of cerebral arteriography, preferential use of regional anesthesia, selective use of the intensive care unit (ICU), and early hospital discharge. The mortality rate, complications, hospital costs, and net income in these patients were then compared with results from 45 CEAs performed in 42 consecutive patients immediately before beginning the CEA pathway. Age, comorbid risk factors, incidence of symptoms, and degree of carotid artery stenosis were similar in both patient groups.\nThe rates of mortality and complications associated with CEA were low (mortality rate, 0%; stroke, 0.9%; transient ischemic attack, 2.8%) and did not vary between the two groups. Implementation of the CEA pathway resulted in significant (p < 0.001) reductions in the use of arteriography (74% to 13%), general anesthesia (100% to 24%), ICU use (98% to 30%), and mean hospital length of stay (5.8 days to 2.0 days). These changes resulted in a 41% reduction in mean total hospital cost ($9652 to $5699) and a 124% increase in mean net hospital income ($1804 to $4039) per CEA (p < 0.01). For the 39 patients (62%) who achieved all elements of the CEA pathway, the mean hospital length of stay was 1.3 days, the mean hospital cost was $4175, and the mean hospital income was $4327.\nCosts associated with CEA can be reduced substantially without increased risk. This makes CEA an extremely cost-effective treatment of carotid disease against which new therapeutic approaches must be measured.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare the results of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in a young population with premature atherosclerosis with the results of an older control group, examining perioperative morbidity and mortality data, recurrent stenosis and symptoms, late stroke, and survival data.\nWe retrospectively studied 26 patients less than 50 years old (mean, 43.2 +/- 3.8 years) and 30 patients greater than 55 years old (mean, 69.1 +/- 7.4 years) who underwent CEA during the same time period. Data were obtained regarding demographics, atherosclerotic risk factors, indication for CEA, perioperative complications, recurrent stenosis and symptoms, late stroke, and survival.\nSmoking was more prevalent among young patients who underwent CEA (92% vs 70%; p = 0.036). Young patients were also more likely to be symptomatic at presentation (92% vs 57%; p = 0.003). The perioperative mortality rate (0% vs 0%) and neurologic morbidity rate (0% vs 3%; p = 1.000) were low for the study patients. During a mean follow-up of 67 +/- 42.7 months, there was no significant difference in survival rate (5-year survival rate, 93% vs 81%; p = 0.373), rate of late ipsilateral (4% vs 3%) and contralateral (4% vs 3%) stroke, restenosis and occlusion (26.9% vs 14.3%), recurrent symptoms (22% vs 17%), reoperation (11.5% vs 5.7%), or contralateral disease (17% vs 23%) development that required surgery for the study or the control cohorts.\nOur data show that there is a high incidence of smoking and symptomatic presentation among young patients in whom carotid occlusive disease develops. CEA may be performed in young patients with low perioperative morbidity and mortality rates. Recurrent disease, late stroke, and survival rates are not significantly different than for older patients. Follow-up with serial duplex ultrasound and reoperation for symptomatic and high-grade asymptomatic restenosis may decrease the risk of late stroke.",

In each case, an occluded SFA was divided 8 to 15 cm distal to its origin, proximally endarterectomized, and sewn end-to-end to a segment of vein to provide adequate conduit length for bypass grafting. Indications for this technique were unavailability of vein as a result of failed previous bypass grafting (n = 10) or previous coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 5). Veins were sewn distally to a below-knee popliteal artery (n = 4; 27%) or tibial artery (n = 11; 73%).\nPrimary patency, secondary patency, and limb salvage rates at 36 months by life table analyses for the 237 grafts were 62.3%, 81.0%, and 77.2%, respectively. The 15 composite SFA-vein bypass grafts had 36-month primary patency, secondary patency, and limb salvage rates of 60.0%, 72.0%, and 65.9%, respectively (mean follow-up, 15 months). Currently, eight of these patients (53%) have patent bypass grafts; two (13%) died at 4 and 18 months after the operation with patent grafts; two (13%) underwent amputations for progressive foot gangrene despite a patent bypass graft; and three (20%) had grafts that thrombosed at 4, 5, and 10 months. Typical hyperplastic intrinsic graft-threatening stenoses developed in two patients (13%) in the SFA segment at 4 and 8 months; they were discovered by routine duplex scan surveillance.\nComposite SFA eversion endarterectomy/vein graft conduits yield acceptable results, behave similarly to other autogenous conduits used for technically high-risk infrainguinal revascularization, and are beneficial when autogenous vein is limited.",

    "abstract": "To determine the long-term outcome and prognostic factors after early infrainguinal graft failure (< 30 days).\nRetrospective analysis of limb salvage data, patency data, and prognostic risk factors in 112 new infrainguinal bypass grafts from 1985 to 1995 that occluded within 30 days of operation.\nThirty-six femoropopliteal and 76 femorotibial/femoropedal arterial bypass (\"index\") procedures were performed for rest pain (50%), tissue loss (31%), or disabling claudication (19%). In 103 patients, an immediate additional revascularization (\"takeback\") procedure was performed at the time of early graft failure. Life table analysis of the takeback procedures for threatened limbs (n = 84) revealed limb salvage rates of 74%, 54%, 40%, and 31% at 1 month, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years, respectively. The 1-month limb salvage rate (threatened limbs) was 12% (1 of 8) in patients who were not taken back for revascularization and 33% (4 of 12) in patients who had undergone more than one takeback procedure within 30 days. The secondary graft patency rates for the takeback procedures (n = 103) were 70%, 37%, 27%, and 23% at 1 month, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years, respectively. Univariate and life table analysis revealed that patients who were given anticoagulation medication after the index procedure (before graft thrombosis) or patients who had undergone previous ipsilateral leg revascularization had significantly lower rates of limb salvage and graft patency (p < 0.05). The limb salvage rate was also significantly worse in patients who had single-vessel runoff compared with those who had multiple-vessel runoff (p < 0.01). Thrombectomy and revision or complete graft replacement had a better secondary patency rate than thrombectomy alone (p < 0.05). Autogenous vein grafts had better outcome than polytetrafluoroethylene-containing grafts, but statistical significance was not achieved. No significant differences in limb salvage or graft patency rates were found between femoropopliteal versus femorotibial/femoropedal bypass grafting, age, gender, previous inflow surgery, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, or cardiac, renal, or pulmonary disease.\nThe long-term limb salvage and graft patency rates after takeback revascularization procedures for early graft failure are poor. Despite poor outcome, a single takeback procedure appears warranted in all patients. Multiple takeback procedures, however, do not appear to be justified, especially in patients who are given anticoagulation medication after the index bypass procedure, repeat leg bypass procedures, or if there is no potential for graft revision.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance arteriography (MRA) of the lower extremities affords several possible advantages over conventional contrast arteriography (CA). We hypothesized that MRA of the infrageniculate vessels was sufficiently accurate to replace CA before revascularization procedures in patients with limb-threatening ischemia.\nFifty-three extremities in 49 patients were prospectively evaluated before attempted infrageniculate revascularization procedures with preoperative infrageniculate time-of-flight MRA (cost, $170/study) and standard contrast arteriography (cost, $1310/study) of the aortoiliac and runoff vessels. Independent operative plans were formulated based on the MRA and CA results before the revascularization procedure. Intraoperative, prebypass arteriograms (IOA; cost, $46/study) were obtained in all patients to confirm the adequacy of the distal runoff. The preoperative plans formulated by the results of MRA and CA were compared with the actual procedure performed based on the IOA. All arteriograms (CA, MRA, IOA) were reviewed after the operation by two independent reviewers, and the number of patent vessel segments and those with < 50% stenosis was determined.\nRevascularization procedures were performed in 44 of 53 extremities (83%), and amputation was performed in nine extremities (17%) because of an absence of a suitable bypass target. The CA and MRA were equally effective in predicting the optimal operative plans as determined from IOA (CA, 42 of 53 [77%] vs MRA, 40 of 53 [75%]; p = 0.79). More patent vessel segments were seen on CA than MRA (reviewer A, 229 vs 174, kappa = 0.32; reviewer B, 321 vs 314, kappa = 0.46); however, a comparable number of segments were seen if the vessels of the foot were excluded. The accuracy (reviewer A, 78% vs 68%, p = 0.003; reviewer B, 75% vs 67%, p = 0.003) and sensitivity (reviewer A, 69% vs 51%, p = 0.001; reviewer B, 68% vs 46%, p = 0.0001) of CA relative to IOA were superior to those of MRA, although the specificity was comparable (reviewer A, 86% vs 90%, p = 0.31; reviewer B, 82% vs 87%, p = 0.52). The combination of MRA and IOA would have resulted in the optimal operative plan in 51 of the 53 cases (96%) and was comparable with CA and IOA (53 of 53; 100%; p = 0.50). Substitution of MRA and IOA for CA and IOA could potentially have saved an estimated $60,420.\nThe combination of MRA and IOA provides an accurate, cost-efficient strategy for visualization of the infrageniculate vessels before revascularization procedures.",

    "abstract": "Saphenous vein harvesting remains a significant source of morbidity that occurs in 1% to 24% of patients who require lower extremity bypass or coronary artery bypass grafting. In an attempt to reduce complications associated with this procedure, we have used a new, minimally invasive technique to remove the greater saphenous vein.\nThe video-assisted technique uses currently available video-endoscopic equipment with mechanical retraction to dissect the saphenous vein with two to three limited incisions. After initial vein exposure is accomplished through limited incisions, mechanical retraction is maintained with an endoplastic retractor or an endoscopic saphenous vein retractor. The dissection is visualized on the video monitor to isolate and control side branches, the vein is removed, and arterial bypass grafting is then accomplished as a reverse vein graft.\nBetween Sep. 1994 and July 1996, 65 patients underwent 68 arterial bypass operations in which the greater saphenous vein was harvested with video-assisted techniques. Indications for bypass grafting included 31 patients with ischemic ulceration, 23 with rest pain, 11 with claudication, and three with popliteal aneurysms. Of the 68 bypass procedures performed, 52 were to below-knee vessels, 22 of which included tibial or peroneal anastomoses. Sixty-four patients (98.5%) had no significant complications related to this video-assisted technique. For all patients, the average time-required to remove a 45 cm vein segment was 60 minutes. The average time using the more recently developed endoscopic saphenous vein retractor was 46 minutes. The median postoperative length of stay was 6 days. One patient had bleeding into the leg related to the video-assisted technique. Three patients (4.4%) required rehospitalization for wound care related to arterial access sites. Patency has been confirmed in 84% of grafts followed-up for a range of 1 to 24 months.\nIn this report representing a series of unselected patients, video-assisted saphenous vein harvesting was technically feasible and had no immediate contraindications. The greater saphenous vein can be removed with minimally invasive techniques, leading to an acceptable morbidity rate, and is a satisfactory conduit for arterial bypass procedures. A prospective clinical trial may be justified to further evaluate the use of this technique in decreasing postoperative morbidity rates, shortening hospitalization, and improving patient care.",

    "abstract": "Traditional options for treating ischemic steal syndrome related to a functioning dialysis access graft or fistula include banding or ligation. Unfortunately, these techniques usually result in inconsistent limb salvage, loss of a functional access, or both. We report our experience with an alternative method of limb revascularization that eliminates steal while maintaining continuous dialysis access.\nPatients who had critical limb ischemia and functioning arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) underwent color-flow duplex scanning, digital photoplethysmography, and arteriography. Arterial ligation distal to the AVF origin eliminated the steal physiologic mechanism while arterial bypass grafting from above to below the AVF revascularized the extremity (distal revascularization-interval ligation [DRIL] procedure).\nFrom March 1994 through December 1996, 21 patients with functioning extremity AVFs presented with critical ischemia and steal syndrome. Eleven patients had chronic ischemia with rest pain, paresthesias, or ulcerations related to nine native fistulae (six brachiocephalic, two basilic vein transpositions, one radiocephalic) and two prosthetic bridge grafts (one upper arm, one lower extremity). Acute ischemia developed in 10 patients related to three native fistulae (two brachiocephalic, one radiocephalic) and seven prosthetic bridge grafts (three forearm, three lower extremity, one upper arm). All 21 patients were treated with the DRIL technique. Three of these patients required treatment for ischemia at the time of AVF construction. Nineteen of 21 bypass procedures were performed with autogenous vein, including nine brachial-brachial, three brachial-radial, two radial-radial, two brachial-ulnar, one popliteal-popliteal, one femoral-popliteal, and one femoral-peroneal. Polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were used for one external iliac-popliteal bypass graft and one axillary-brachial bypass graft. Limb salvage and maintenance of a functional fistula were achieved in 100% and 94%, respectively, at 18 months by life-table analysis.\nThe DRIL technique reliably restores antegrade flow to the ischemic limb, eliminates the potential pathway for the steal physiologic mechanism, and maintains continuous dialysis access in these difficult patients.",

    "abstract": "Maintenance of hemodialysis access grafts represents an enormous social and clinical problem. Current grafts and graft salvage techniques are inadequate. Consequently, there has been increasing interest in the use of minimally invasive catheter techniques to prophylactically treat stenoses in functioning arteriovenous grafts. Prophylactic balloon angioplasty has been widely suggested as prolonging assisted primary patency. We have performed a prospective randomized trial to compare patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for graft stenoses > 50% with a control group that received no intervention. Our hypothesis was that to be efficacious a minimal benefit of 20% prolongation in patency would be necessary.\nColor flow duplex scanning was used to detect > 50% stenoses in functioning expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Patients were then subjected to confirmatory angiographic evaluation. Those who had angiographic stenoses > 50% were randomized to balloon angioplasty or observation. Patients were followed-up with duplex scanning every 2 months. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier technique. Although demographically the patient groups were well matched, there were more prior interventions and concurrent central stenoses in the treatment group. Outcomes were graft thrombosis, graft dysfunction that precluded dialysis, and six or more PTA procedures within 18 months.\nIn the treatment and observation groups, the 6-month patency rates were 69% +/- 7% and 70% +/- 7%, respectively. The 12-month patency rates for the treatment and observation groups were 51% +/- 6% and 47% +/- 4%, respectively. There was no significant difference between these two groups (p = 0.97), with an 80% confidence limit for detection of a difference greater than 20%.\nThis study demonstrates that a generic approach of PTA to treat all polytetrafluoroethylene grafts with stenoses > 50% does not prolong patency and cannot be supported.",

    "abstract": "Salvage of thrombosed prosthetic dialysis shunts can be performed using surgical or endovascular techniques. A prospective randomized trial was designed to compare the efficacy of these two methods in restoring dialysis access function.\nOne hundred fifteen patients with thrombosed dialysis shunts were randomized prospectively to surgical (n = 56) or endovascular (n = 59) therapy. In the surgical group, salvage was attempted with thrombectomy alone in 22% and with thrombectomy plus graft revision in 78%. In the endovascular group, graft function was restored with mechanical (82%) or thrombolytic (18%) graft thrombectomy followed by percutaneous angioplasty.\nStenosis limited to the venous anastomotic area was the cause of shunt thrombosis in 55% of patients, and long-segment venous outflow stenosis or occlusion was the cause in 30%. In 83% of the surgical group and in 72% of the endovascular group, graft function was immediately restored (p = NS). The postoperative graft function rate was significantly better in the surgical group (p < 0.05). Thirty-six percent of grafts managed surgically remained functional at 6 months and 25% at 12 months. In the endovascular group, 11% were functional at 6 months and 9% by 12 months. Patients with long-segment venous outflow stenosis or occlusion had a significantly worse patency rate than those with venous anastomotic stenosis (p < 0.05).\nNeither surgical nor endovascular management resulted in long-term function for the majority of shunts after thrombosis. However, surgical management resulted in significantly longer primary patency in this patient population, supporting its use as the primary method of management in most patients in whom shunt thrombosis develops.",

The postoperative graft function rate was significantly better in the surgical group (p < 0.05). Thirty-six percent of grafts managed surgically remained functional at 6 months and 25% at 12 months. In the endovascular group, 11% were functional at 6 months and 9% by 12 months.

    "abstract": "Thrombosis after arterial injury is often initiated by von Willebrand factor (vWF)-dependent platelet accumulation. A promising antithrombotic strategy is the interruption of platelet/vWF interactions. Previously, we demonstrated how chemical and affinity modification can enhance heparin's anti-vWF activity while reducing conventional anticoagulation. Here, we investigated whether a modified heparin can block platelet-dominated arterial thrombosis.\nStandard heparin was oxidized with periodate, refined to have high vWF affinity and inhibitory potency, and tested in a guinea pig model of platelet-dependent arterial thrombosis. In this model, a controlled mechanical arterial injury yields cyclic flow variations (CFVs) caused by recurrent accumulation of platelet thrombi.\nAll six control animals developed CFVs (mean, 10.4 +/- 2.6 CFVs), and six of seven animals treated with standard heparin also developed CFVs (mean, 7.6 +/- 4.6). Only one of six animals treated with the anti-vWF heparin and one of six treated with AJvW-2 (an anti-vWF antibody) developed CFVs (mean, 2.0 +/- 4.9 and 0.5 +/- 1.2, respectively). Thus both the modified heparin and AJvW-2 were more effective than standard heparin (p < 0.03). Bleeding times and platelet counts were unaffected. A modified activated partial thromboplastin time was less prolonged by the modified high-affinity heparin (91 +/- 17) seconds) than by standard heparin (144 +/- 30 seconds; p < 0.01).\nThe modified heparin with high vWF affinity was a more effective arterial antithrombotic agent, with fewer conventional anticoagulant effects than standard heparin. Interruption of the vWF/platelet interaction is a promising antithrombotic strategy that may be met by novel heparin-based antithrombotic drugs.",

To provide wound coverage, restore vascular continuity, and preserve functional ambulation, a flow-through radial forearm fasciocutaneous free flap was interposed between cut ends of the bypass graft. Venous drainage of the flap was from the cephalic vein to the popliteal vein. At 1 month after the operation, the patient had complete wound healing and began to ambulate. At 11 months an asymptomatic high-grade stenosis in the distal radial artery segment of the reconstruction was successfully treated with percutaneous angioplasty. After 22 months of follow-up there have been no further complications, and the patient continues to have full, functional ambulation. The radial forearm flow-through free flap allows single-stage restoration of bypass graft continuity and coverage of extensive, complex tissue defects. This technique represents a novel approach to this difficult problem and provides a viable alternative to major limb amputation.",

    "abstract": "Within the pediatric population, the rare aortic aneurysm is most often brought on by congenital cardiovascular malformation or connective tissue disorder, trauma, inflammatory disease, or infection. Thus our 8-year-old patient who had multiple aortic aneurysms and evidence of mucopolysaccharidosis presented a doubly unique case. Three and one-half months after the patient underwent emergency aortic valve replacement, we performed resection and graft replacement of both her descending thoracic aorta and thoracoabdominal aorta. Histologic analysis of the aneurysm wall displayed severe medial degeneration with large deposits of acid mucopolysaccharides. Subsequent evaluation, although negative for connective tissue disorders, showed glycosaminoglycans, chondroitin sulfate, and heparan sulfate in the patient's urine. These findings are diagnostic for a heterogeneous group of storage diseases termed mucopolysaccharidoses, although testing of the patient's cultured fibroblasts failed to reveal any specific previously described enzymatic defect. After reviewing the literature, we believe that this is the first known successfully treated pediatric aortic aneurysm associated with mucopolysaccharidosis.",

    "abstract": "This article describes an original laparoscopic technique that allows performance of aortobifemoral bypass grafting.\nThe technique described is the result of 6 years of in vitro and animal experimentation. It also represents the end result of prior clinical research with laparoscopy-assisted aortoiliac surgery and totally laparoscopic retroperitoneal aortobifemoral bypass grafting. The technique consists of the creation of a flap of retroperitoneum that is used to separate the intraperitoneal organs from the content of the retroperitoneal cavity. Surgery can then be conducted with no intrusion of any intraabdominal organ into the operative field. Another advantage is that the pneumoperitoneum is equally distributed among the two cavities. A conventional aortobifemoral bypass procedure is then performed with laparoscopic instrumentation.\nThe described technique has been performed in three patients to date. The patients' intraoperative blood loss did not exceed 500 ml, and no complication arose. The intraoperative need for crystalloids was of the order of 3 L (almost half the quantity usually administered). The patients' analgesia requirement was low in these patients, and return to walking was rapid. They were sent home between the fourth and sixth postoperative days.\nThe innovative technique described here is safe and appears to ease the patient's postoperative course. Data recovered from the multicenter study, which is now in its preliminary phase, should help answer numerous questions. We expect the procedure to be reproducible in other university centers that are participating in the trial.",

    "abstract": "Retroviral transduction for genetic enhancement of endothelial cell (EC) anti-thrombotic phenotype offers potential for improving the clinical success of vascular graft seeding; however, application of this technique may bring concomitant alteration in cell functionality.\nHuman microvascular ECs were transduced with a retroviral vector encoding for the marker gene beta-galactosidase. Transduced endothelial cells (rtECs) and nontransduced endothelial cells (ntECs) were evaluated by flow cytometry for expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and tissue factor (TF) on both smooth (coverslips) and graft (Dacron, 6 mm inside diameter) surfaces under static and shear exposed conditions. Graft EC retention was measured after 6-hour pulsatile perfusions. Platelet and neutrophil adherence was measured on perfused coverslips.\nLower levels of ICAM-1 were expressed by rtECs on coverslips under both static (p < 0.01 vs static ntECs) and shear exposed conditions (p < 0.01 vs static and shear ntECs). Accordingly, fewer polymorphonuclear leukocytes adhered to rtEC monolayers (p < 0.01 vs ntECs). No difference in ICAM-1 and TF expression by static graft seeded rtECs and ntECs was observed. However, graft-seeded rtECs that were exposed to wall shear stress displayed less TF than sheared ntECs (p < 0.05). Transduction did not affect EC retention to the sheared graft surface.\nThese data suggest that retroviral transduction does not elicit a prothrombotic/proinflammatory phenotype, rather indices of these states appear in some conditions to be reduced. Further, transduction does not adversely affect EC adherence to Dacron graft surfaces under arterial hemodynamics.",

    "abstract": "Thrombosed peripheral vessels that are pharmacologically or mechanically recanalized have diminished long-term patency rates compared with vessels that are repaired before occlusion. We hypothesized that thrombosis induces proinflammatory changes in the arterial media that may contribute to postthrombotic vascular remodeling.\nWe studied expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), a mediator of leukocyte recruitment, in the arterial wall after thrombosis. Thrombosis was induced in rabbit superficial femoral arteries by embolizing polystyrene beads (Thr-emb) or by ligation (Thr-lig). Control vessels were dissected but not ligated (C-dis) or were subjected to bead embolization and immediate removal (C-emb). Arterial wall ICAM expression was measured by indirect immunohistochemical analysis at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 1 week. Staining intensity was graded from 0 (none) to 4 (intense) by observers who were blinded to the experimental conditions.\nNo increase in ICAM expression by thrombosed vessels was present at 6 hours. After 24 hours, ICAM expression in the media of thrombosed vessels was increased (Thr-emb, 2.3 +/- 0.5; Thr-lig, 2.0 +/- 0) compared with control vessels (C-dis, 0 +/- 0; C-emb, 0.8 +/- 0.5; p < 0.004). This difference became more marked at 1 week. ICAM staining localized to actin-staining regions of the media.\nArterial thrombosis, but not surgical injury, induces pronounced early and sustained upregulation of ICAM expression in smooth muscle-containing regions of the arterial media. Upregulation of ICAM is likely to promote recruitment of inflammatory cells or mediate vascular remodeling after luminal thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) not only relaxes vascular smooth muscles, but it also reduces platelet adhesion and is itself a potent antiaggregatory substance. Experimental studies have shown that the release of NO is modulated by the blood flow. However, little clinical information is available about the effects of hemodynamic changes after arterial reconstruction on NO production. We therefore examined whether the plasma levels of nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) ions increased after arterial reconstruction in patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO).\nBlood samples were obtained from the femoral artery in seven patients who underwent arterial reconstruction and seven healthy individuals (control). NO2- and NO3- levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography before the operation and 1 hour and 14 days after the operation. In addition, the mean femoral artery blood flow and ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) were also measured using a duplex and Doppler velocimeter both before and after the operations.\nIn the control subjects, the mean plasma NO2-, NO3-, and NOx (NO2- plus NO3-) levels in the femoral artery were 0.37 +/- 0.15 mumol/L, 45.6 +/- 10.8 mumol/L, and 46.0 +/- 10.9 mumol/L, respectively. Before the operation in the patients with ASO, the mean plasma NO3- (23.8 +/- 2.2 mumol/L) and NOx levels (24.0 +/- 2.3 mumol/L) were significantly lower than those in the control subjects, whereas the plasma NO2- levels (0.27 +/- 0.04 mumol/L) were comparable between the two groups. At 14 days after operation, the mean plasma NO3- and NOx levels in the femoral artery were significantly increased to 42.8 +/- 5.6 mumol/L and 43.4 +/- 5.6 mumol/L compared with those before the operation, whereas the mean plasma NO2- levels (0.50 +/- 0.05 mumol/L) changed significantly. The mean ABI and the mean flow rate before the operation were 0.32 +/- 0.07 and 344 +/- 145 ml/min, respectively. Both the ABI and the mean flow rate significantly increased to 1.04 +/- 0.06 and 627 +/- 141 ml/min after the operation.\nIn patients who have ASO, the mean plasma level of NO is significantly lower than that of healthy individuals. In patients with ASO, the mean blood flow increased significantly after arterial reconstruction. This hemodynamic improvement may thus enhance NO production and may also help to maintain the patency of the bypass graft or native artery.",

    "abstract": "Acute aortic occlusion with subsequent ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) of the lower extremities is known to predispose to lung injury. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of this injury are not clear. In the present study, we studied the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and nitric oxide (NO) in lung injury caused by lower extremity I/R.\nA rat model in which the infrarenal aorta was cross-clamped for 3 hours followed by 1 hour of reperfusion was used. The rats were randomized into five groups: group 1, aorta exposed but not clamped; group 2, aorta clamped for 3 hours, followed by 1 hour of reperfusion; group 3, 1 mg/kg dexamethasone administered before the aorta was clamped; group 4, 25 mg aminoguanidine, a specific inducible NO synthase (iNOS) inhibitor, administered before the aorta was clamped; and group 5, 2 mg/kg TNFbp, a PEG-ylated dimeric form of the high-affinity p55 TNF receptor I (RI), administered before the aorta was clamped. NO concentration in the exhaled gas (ENO) was measured, as an index of NO production by the lung, in 30 minute intervals during I/R. Serial arterial blood samples for TNF assay were obtained during the course of the experiment. At the end of the experiment, the lungs were removed and histologically examined for evidence of injury.\nENO in group 2 increased from 0.7 +/- 0.3 ppb at baseline to 54.3 +/- 7.5 ppb at the end of ischemia and remained stable during reperfusion (54.6 +/- 8.5 ppb at the end of reperfusion). ENO production was blocked by aminoguanidine, by dexamethasone, and by TNFbp given before aortic occlusion. Serum TNF in groups 2, 3 and 4 increased rapidly during early ischemia, reaching its peak value 60 minutes after occlusion of the aorta, then gradually declined to baseline levels at the end of ischemia, and remained low during reperfusion. TNFbp decreased serum TNF concentration significantly when it was given before aortic occlusion. Histologic examination of the lungs at the end of the experiment revealed that aminoguanidine, dexamethasone, and TNFbp had a protective effect on the lungs.\nSerum TNF increases rapidly during lower extremity ischemia and causes increased production of NO from the lung by upregulating iNOS. Increased NO is associated with more severe lung injury, and iNOS blockade has beneficial effects on the lung. TNF blockade before ischemia decreases NO production by the lung and attenuates lung injury. ENO can be used as an early marker of lung injury caused by lower extremity I/R.",

    "abstract": "Aggressive treatment has improved the long-term outcome of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) and low birth weight (LBW) neonates, but it has also increased the risk of iatrogenic lesions. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the incidence of vascular injuries observed in the neonatal intensive care unit of our hospital.\nFrom 1987 to 1994, 2898 neonates were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit; 335 of them were either LBW or ELBW (11.5%). A review of the charts of these neonates disclosed nine neonates (four male, five female) with vascular lesions (2.6%); the mean gestational age of these patients was 28.7 weeks (range, 24 to 33 weeks), the mean weight at birth was 880 g (range, 590 to 1450 g), and the mean weight at diagnosis was 1825 g (range, 1230 to 2700 g). In the same period, 10 neonates with vascular injuries were reported in the 2563 neonates who weighed more than 1500 g (0.3%). The injuries observed in LBW and ELBW group were arteriovenous fistulas (two bilateral) at the femoral level (six neonates), carotid lesion (one neonate), and limb ischemia (two neonates). Injury was associated with venipuncture in seven neonates, and with umbilical catheter in one; the case of carotid lesion was related to surgical error. No general symptoms were observed.\nThe carotid lesion and five arteriovenous fistulas were repaired by microsurgical techniques; one case of limb ischemia was resolved with thrombolytic drugs, whereas an amputation at the knee level was required in the other after 10 days of medical treatment.

    "abstract": "Air plethysmography (APG) has the potential to help evaluate different treatments for the prevention of recurrence of venous ulcers; however, there are little reported data on the variation and reliability of the different parameters. This study aimed to assess the variation in different APG parameters in patients with chronic venous disease and to evaluate the reliability of APG in test-retest situations.\nSeventeen patients (18 limbs) with chronic venous disease were recruited into this study. Subjects were asked to undergo tests on two occasions, 1 to 6 weeks apart. Three tests were performed at each visit, and three patients had 10 tests performed at one visit. The coefficients of variation were calculated for repeated measurements and test-retest reliability, and the differences between the means of three tests and the 10 tests were also analyzed.\nThe coefficients of variation for the repeated measurements ranged from 7.5% to 27% for the majority of parameters of APG. The differences between the means of three tests and the means of 10 tests were less than 10% in this study. The coefficients of variation of method error were approximately 10% in test-retest measures.\nThis study has shown that evaluations of calf pump function and venous reflux using APG display variations in repeated measurements and in the test-retest measures. The variations found within patients and on retesting patients on different days suggest that APG is very unlikely to be able to detect small changes in the parameters of venous reflux and calf pump function. It is essential to understand the inherent variation of APG measurements when they are used to assess treatments that are designed to improve venous function.",

    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is equated with a need for limb salvage. Arterial reconstruction and major amputation are the therapies ultimately available to such patients. We studied whether measurements of skin perfusion pressure (SPP) can be used to accurately identify those patients with CLI who require vascular reconstruction or major amputation and distinguish them from patients whose foot ulcer would heal with local wound care or minor amputation.\nFifty-three patients with a total of 61 limbs with a nonhealing foot ulcer (age range, 47 to 88 years; mean, 70.8 +/- 9.8 years; 33 men, 20 women) who were referred to the Vascular Laboratory at Morristown Memorial Hospital for evaluation of arterial insufficiency were studied in a prospective, double-blinded fashion. Patients were included in the study if informed consent was obtained, and patients were excluded if there was uncontrolled sepsis or if they required guillotine amputation. The size and site of the foot ulcer was recorded. If gangrene was present, the location and extent was also noted. The pulses were examined and recorded, and the ankle-brachial index was determined for each limb. Measurements of SPP were made at the proximal margin of the ulcer in viable tissue (not in the bed of the ulcer). SPP measurements were made independent of the vascular surgeon's evaluation of the limb and were not part of his clinical decision regarding management of the foot ulcer. The SPP measurements were compared (Fischer's exact test) with the clinical decision for therapy (group I, arterial reconstruction or major amputation; or group II, wound debridement, minor amputation, or both). SPP was also compared with the outcome (ulcer healed or failed to heal) of therapy in group II. From contingency tables we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV), and the overall accuracy of SPP measurement as a diagnostic test for critical limb ischemia.\nThere was no difference in the size or location of foot ulcers between groups I and II, nor was there a difference in ulcer size or location between limbs that healed and did not heal in group II. The prevalence of diabetes was similar in all groups and subgroups. The ABI was not predictive of the need for reconstruction or major amputation nor the outcome of local therapy. SPP measurements identified 31 of 32 limbs diagnosed as having CLI by clinical evaluation (i.e., group I, those limbs that required vascular reconstruction or major amputation). Of those patients who were clinically assessed as not having CLI (group II), SPP measurements diagnosed 12 of the 14 limbs that did not heal as having CLI (PPV, 75%) and 11 of 15 limbs that did heal as not having CLI (NPV, 85%). The sensitivity of SPP less than 30 mm Hg as a diagnostic test of CLI was 85%, and the specificity was 73%. The overall diagnostic accuracy of SPP less than 30 mm Hg as a diagnostic test of critical limb ischemia was 79.3% (p < 0.002, Fischer's exact test).\nWe conclude that SPP measurement is an objective, noninvasive method that can be used to diagnose critical limb ischemia with approximately 80% accuracy.",

All patent intercostal arteries were reattached when this was technically feasible. Delayed neurologic complications occurred in eight patients who underwent operation for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm between September 1992 and March 1997, between 1 and 14 days after awakening from anesthesia. All patients had immediate cerebrospinal fluid drainage on recognition of their symptoms.\nPatients were evaluated by an independent neurologist and were classified by a modified Tarlov score between 0 and 5. All eight patients improved at least two points by discharge. The mean change in Tarlov score from onset to discharge was 2.4 +/- 1.1 (p = 0.008).\nCerebrospinal fluid drainage significantly improved late-onset neurologic deficit that occurred between 1 day and 2 weeks after operation in our series. Immediate drainage should be considered when signs of neurologic deficit first begin to appear.",

This study was performed to test the hypothesis that intraluminal thrombus can significantly reduce AAA wall stress.\nAAA wall stresses were determined by axisymmetric finite element analysis. Model AAAs had external diameters ranging from 2.0 to 4.0 cm. Model parameters included: AAA length, 6 cm; wall thickness, 1.5 mm; Poisson's ratio, 0.49; Young's modulus, 1.0 MPa; and luminal pressure, 1.6 x 10(5) dyne/cm2. Stresses were calculated for each model without thrombus, and then were recalculated with thrombus filling 10% of the AAA cavity. Calculations were repeated as thrombus size was increased in 10% increments and as thrombus elastic modulus increased from 0.01 MPa to 1.0 MPa. Maximum wall stresses were compared between models that had intraluminal thrombus and the unmodified models. Stress reduction greater than 25% was considered significant.\nThe maximum stress reduction of 51% occurred when thrombus with elastic modulus of 1.0 MPa filled the entire AAA cavity. Stresses were reduced by only 25% as modulus decreased to 0.2 MPa. Similarly, decreasing thrombus size by 70% resulted in stress reduction of only 28%.

Female sex was associated with a 0.14 cm reduction in IAD and black race with a 0.01 cm increase in IAD. A 0.1 cm change in IAD was associated with large changes in the independent variables: 29 years in age, 19 cm or 40 cm in height, 35 kg in weight, 11 kg/m2 in body mass index, and 0.35 m2 in body surface area. Nearly all height-weight groups were within 0.1 cm of the gender means, and the unadjusted gender means differed by only 0.23 cm. The variation among medical centers had more influence on IAD than did the combination of age, gender, race, and body size.\nAge, gender, race, and body size have statistically significant but small effects on IAD. Use of these parameters to define AAA may not offer sufficient advantage over simpler definitions (such as an IAD > or = 3.0 cm) to be warranted.",

    "abstract": "The structural features that underlie carotid plaque disruption and symptoms are largely unknown. We have previously shown that the chemical composition and structural complexity of critical carotid stenoses are related to plaque size regardless of symptoms. To further determine whether the spatial distribution of individual plaque components in relation to the lumen corresponds to symptomatic outcome, we evaluated 99 carotid endarterectomy plaques.\nIndications for operation were symptomatic disease in 59 instances (including hemispheric transient ischemic attack in 29, stroke in 19, and amaurosis fugax in 11) and angiographic asymptomatic stenosis > 75% in 40. Plaques removed after remote symptoms beyond 6 months were excluded. Histologic sections from the most stenotic region of the plaque were examined using computer-assisted morphometric analysis. The percent area of plaque cross-section occupied by necrotic lipid core with or without associated plaque hematoma, by calcification, as well as the distance from the lumen or fibrous cap of each of these features, were determined. The presence of foam cells, macrophages, and inflammatory cell collections within, on, or just beneath the fibrous cap was taken as an additional indication of plaque neoformation.\nThe mean percent angiographic stenosis was 82% +/- 11% and 79% +/- 13% for the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups, respectively (p > 0.05). The necrotic core was twice as close to the lumen in symptomatic plaques when compared with asymptomatic plaques (0.27 +/- 0.3 mm vs 0.5 +/- 0.5 mm; p < 0.01). The percent area of necrotic core or calcification was similar for both groups (22% vs 26% and 7% vs 6%, respectively). There was no significant relationship to symptom production of either the distance of calcification from the lumen or of the percent area occupied by the lipid necrotic core or calcification. The number of macrophages infiltrating the region of the fibrous cap was three times greater in the symptomatic plaques compared with the asymptomatic plaques (1114 +/- 1104 vs 385 +/- 622, respectively, p < 0.009). Regions of fibrous cap disruption or ulceration were more commonly observed in the symptomatic plaques than in the asymptomatic plaques (32% vs 20%). None of the demographic or clinical atherosclerosis risk factors distinguished between symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques.\nThese findings indicate that proximity of plaque necrotic core to the lumen and cellular indicators of plaque neoformation or inflammatory reaction about the fibrous cap are associated with clinical ischemic events. The morphologic complexity of carotid stenoses does not appear to determine symptomatic outcome but rather the topography of individual plaque components in relation to the fibrous cap and the lumen. Imaging techniques that precisely resolve the position of the necrotic core and evidence of inflammatory reactions within carotid plaques should help identify high-risk stenoses before disruption and symptomatic carotid disease.",

    "abstract": "To summarize mortality, morbidity, and long-term patency data of bifurcated aortoiliac or aortofemoral bypass graft procedures in aortoiliac occlusive disease.\nA Medline search was performed of the medical literature published between 1970 and 1996. Studies were included if (1) they reported patency rates based on life tables and the number at risk was provided at yearly intervals; and (2) patient and study characteristics were reported in sufficient detail. Mortality and morbidity risks were pooled using a fixed-effects model. The patency data were combined using a technique that enables adjustment for differences across studies in patient characteristics or reporting methods. In the current analysis, we corrected for the symptomatic status of the patients at the time of surgery (claudication vs ischemia) and the unit of observation used in reporting the patency (limb vs patient).\nWe identified 23 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The aggregated operative mortality risk in the older studies (started before 1975) was 4.6%, as compared with 3.3% in the more recent studies (p = 0.01). The aggregated systemic morbidity risk was 13.1% in the older studies and 8.3% in the more recent studies (p < 0.001). Limb-based patency rates for patients with claudication were 91.0% and 86.8% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, as compared with 87.5% and 81.8% for patients with ischemia. Patency rates reported in the older studies were markedly similar to those of more recent studies (p = 0.58).\nOur study suggests that mortality and systemic morbidity rates of aortic bifurcation graft procedures have dropped since 1975, whereas patency rates seem to be fairly constant over the years.",

The aggregated systemic morbidity risk was 13.1% in the older studies and 8.3% in the more recent studies (p < 0.001). Limb-based patency rates for patients with claudication were 91.0% and 86.8% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, as compared with 87.5% and 81.8% for patients with ischemia. Patency rates reported in the older studies were markedly similar to those of more recent studies (p = 0.58).",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is an increasingly popular invasive treatment for peripheral arterial disease, but there have been very few controlled trials to justify its use. This randomized controlled clinical trial was performed to determine in patients with mild and moderate intermittent claudication differences in outcome between PTA and conventional medical treatment after 2 years.\nSix hundred patients with claudication were screened at the Peripheral Vascular Clinic, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Sixty-two patients with short femoral artery stenoses or occlusions (47 patients) and iliac stenoses (15 patients) were randomized to either PTA plus medical treatment (PTA group, 30 patients) or to medical treatment alone (control group, 32 patients). Medical treatment consisted of daily low-dose aspirin and advice on smoking and exercise. Outcome measures studied were patient-reported maximum walking distance, exercise treadmill distance until onset of claudication, treadmill maximum walking distance, ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI), quality of life (Nottingham Health Profile), and duplex ultrasound-measured extent of occlusive disease.\nAt 2 years of follow-up, the PTA group and control subjects did not differ significantly in patient-reported maximum walking, treadmill onset to claudication, treadmill maximum walking distances, or ABPI (p > 0.05). However, the PTA group had significantly fewer occluded arteries (p = 0.003) and a lesser degree of stenosis (expressed in terms of the velocity ratio; p = 0.004) in patent arteries. Quality of life was not demonstrably different between the two groups (p > 0.05).\nTwo years after PTA, patients had less extensive disease than medically treated patients, but this did not translate into a significant advantage in terms of improved walking or quality of life. There are important implications for patient management and future clinical research.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between lumen narrowing, intimal hyperplasia, and wall remodeling after angioplasty was explored in a nonhuman primate model of atherosclerosis.\nCynomolgus monkeys (n = 37) used in long-term atherosclerosis studies underwent left iliac artery balloon injury. The uninjured right iliac artery served as a reference segment for intraanimal comparisons. One month later iliac arteries were fixed by perfusion (100 mm Hg) and removed for cross-sectional analysis to determine mean values for lumen area (LA), intimal area (IA), internal elastic lamina area (IELA), plaque burden (IA/IELA), and depth of wall injury. Values for each balloon-injured iliac artery were normalized to the contralateral uninjured iliac artery (percent of control), and linear regression analysis was performed comparing LA with IA, with IELA, and with depth of injury. Comparisons were also made between those arteries that remained dilated 1 month after balloon injury (LA > or = 140%; n = 13) and those that renarrowed (LA < or = 100%; n = 14).\nFor all 37 animals, LA 1 month after balloon injury correlated well with IELA (r = 0.72; p < 0.001) but not with IA (r = 0.10; p = 0.54), suggesting that changes in artery size rather than neointimal mass determined lumen caliber. When comparing arteries that remained dilated (n = 13) with those that renarrowed (n = 14), there were no differences in depth of wall injury (injury depth: 0, no injury; 1, intima; 2, IEL; 3, media; 4, EEL; 2.1 +/- 0.3 vs 1.6 +/- 0.3; p = 0.12), neointimal accumulation (IA, 507% +/- 118% vs. 421% +/- 81% of control; p = 0.55), or plaque burden (IA/IELA, 0.39 +/- 0.04 vs 0.37 +/- 0.06; p = 0.71), respectively. However, wall size defined as IELA was significantly smaller in arteries that renarrowed than in those that remained dilated (IELA, 115% +/- 14% vs 230% +/- 19% of control; p < 0.001).\nRestenosis after angioplasty has been attributed to intimal hyperplasia, equating loss of lumen caliber with neointimal mass. The data presented herein suggest that lumen narrowing after arterial wall injury may have little to do with intimal mass per se, but rather that a change in wall caliber or wall narrowing is the cause of restenosis.",

    "abstract": "Recanalization after acute lower limb deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is well documented, but the precise mechanism and timing of these events has not been well characterized. Regression of DVT has been presumed to result from activation of the endogenous fibrinolytic system. This study was performed to compare measurements of the enzymatic components of the intrinsic fibrinolytic system (tissue plasminogen activator [tPA], plasminogen activator inhibitor [PAI-1]) with the observed morphologic changes in thrombosed venous segments using venous duplex ultrasound scanning (VDUS) at intervals after diagnosis of acute DVT.\nNineteen patients with acute DVT underwent serial VDUS to assess regression of thrombus at intervals of 1 to 2 weeks, 3 to 6 weeks, 8 to 12 weeks, and 24 to 36 weeks. The extent of thrombus in each limb was quantitated at each interval by VDUS of the residual thrombus present in each of five major axial venous segments: the common femoral, superficial femoral, profunda femoris, popliteal, and tibial veins. Thrombus scores for the group at each interval were compared with baseline scores at diagnosis to calculate the percent residual thrombus. Endogenous fibrinolytic activity was determined at the same intervals by serologic assay of the biologic activities of tPA and its inhibitor PAI-1.\nThrombus regression was evident by VDUS at 1 to 2 weeks and progressed such that only 26% of residual thrombus remained at 24 to 36 weeks. Complete resolution of thrombus occurred in 10 of 18 patients (56%) who completed the 9-month study. Baseline mean tPA activity was 0.60 +/- 0.07 IU/ml and increased to 1.31 +/- 0.26 IU/ml at 1 to 2 weeks (p = 0.014). tPA activity remained significantly elevated through the 8 to 12 week interval and returned to baseline at 24 to 36 weeks. PAI-1 activity was elevated relative to an age-matched population at baseline (23.1 +/- 1.8 AU/ml) but remained unchanged throughout the study period. Progression of thrombus was observed in three patients (15.8%). Patients who experienced propagation of thrombus did not have the increased tPA activity that appeared to mark activation of intrinsic fibrinolysis.\nRegression of acute DVT begins early and continues for at least 9 months. It is accompanied by significant enhancement of the endogenous fibrinolysis, which appears to be primarily mediated by increased tPA activity. Patients who have thrombus propagation in spite of standard antithrombotic therapy may have failure of activation of endogenous fibrinolysis.",

    "abstract": "Although much attention has been focused on lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (LEDVT), there is a relative paucity of data regarding the impact of upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT) on morbidity and mortality rates. To increase our knowledge with the latter disease, we have reviewed our experience at our institution with 170 patients who had brachial, axillary, and subclavian vein thromboses.\nOver the past 5 years, UEDVT was diagnosed in 170 patients by duplex scanning. The indications for duplex examination were either upper extremity swelling (95%) or as part of the workup for pulmonary embolism (5%). There were 103 women (61%) and 67 men (39%), with ages ranging from 9 to 101 years (mean, 68 +/- 17 years). The diagnosis was made in 152 patients (89%) while they were admitted to the hospital and in 18 patients (11%) in the outpatient clinic. Risk factors included presence of a central venous catheter or pacemaker in 110 patients (65%), malignancy in 63 patients (37%), concomitant LEDVT in 19 patients (11%), and history of LEDVT in 18 patients (11%). Fifty-six patients (33%) had multiple risk factors, whereas 36 patients (21%) had no obvious risk factor.\nThe 1-month and 3-month mortality rates for the entire study group were 16% and 34%, respectively. Patients who had concomitant LEDVT, were 75 years of age or older, and were not treated with anticoagulation medication had a significantly higher 1-month mortality rate. Patients whose diagnoses were made in the outpatient setting were statistically younger and had a lower 3-month mortality rate when compared with the patients whose diagnoses were made as inpatients. Pulmonary embolism was documented by ventilation/perfusion scan in 12 patients (7%). Although no patient in the group in which UEDVT was diagnosed on an outpatient basis was documented to have a pulmonary embolism and 12 patients (8%) in the inpatient group had pulmonary emboli, this difference was not statistically significant. Anticoagulation medication did not totally prevent pulmonary embolism in this review. All patients were followed-up for between 0 to 49 months (mean, 13 +/- 1 months). No swelling of the affected arm was observed in 145 patients (94%); four patients complained of mild intermittent swelling (2%), and seven patients reported significant swelling (4%).\nContrary to previous reports, these data suggest that UEDVT is associated with a low incidence of postthrombotic upper extremity swelling, but a significant incidence of pulmonary embolism and rate of mortality. This review suggests that UEDVT is at least as serious a disease entity as LEDVT and should be managed as aggressively as LEDVT.",

    "abstract": "Venous aneurysms have been reported to occur in most major veins. These aneurysms may be misdiagnosed as soft tissue masses or as inguinal or femoral hernias. Venous aneurysms of the deep system have been associated with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). To more precisely characterize these lesions, we reviewed our experience with the disease.\nA retrospective analysis of our experience over 22 years was performed. The presentation and management of these lesions were reviewed and compared with the literature.\nThirty-nine venous aneurysms were reported in 30 patients. There were 14 men and 16 women. The patients' ages ranged from 3 to 75 years. Thirty aneurysms were located in the lower extremities, four in the upper extremity, and five in the internal jugular vein. Fifty-seven percent of lower extremity aneurysms occurred in the deep system. Patients' symptoms were a mass (75%) associated with pain (67%) and swelling (42%). Thromboembolism occurred in six patients, DVT in three, and PE in three. Eight of nine patients (89%) who had aneurysms of the superficial venous system had their condition misdiagnosed. Diagnosis was made by phlebography (60%), color flow duplex scanning (27%), continuous-wave Doppler scanning (10%), or magnetic resonance imaging (10%). The aneurysm size ranged from 1.7 to 6.0 cm. Management consisted of tangential excision in five (17%), total excision in 23 (77%), and observation in seven (6%).\nVenous aneurysms are unusual vascular malformations that occur equally between the sexes and are seen at any age. Most patients have a painful mass of the extremity, and diagnosis is achieved by radiologic examination. Superficial venous aneurysms of the inguinal region are often misdiagnosed. Thromboembolism is more common in aneurysms involving the deep venous system. Because of their potential morbidity, management should be surgical in the majority of cases.",

We report our experience with ethanol ablation of VMs.\nAll 12 patients (seven women; mean age, 37 years) were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging before treatment. A total of 19 prior surgical excisions had been performed for seven of the patients. Symptoms were present in all 12 patients and included bleeding, pain, swelling, and limitation of exercise. The VMs were present in the lower extremities of seven patients, in the upper extremities of three patients, and in the flank and buttocks in two patients.\nThe 12 patients have undergone 30 injection procedures, with six patients requiring one, three patients requiring two, two patients requiring three, and one patient having undergone 12 treatments. General anesthesia was used in 11 patients. Blood loss was minimal for all procedures, and 28 of the 30 procedures were technically successful. Skin ulceration was seen in approximately half of the treated VMs, all of which healed with local wound care. Focal VMs were injected in six patients and resolved with a single treatment in five patients. Patients were free of symptoms at a mean follow-up of 10 months. Extensive VMs were injected for discrete, symptomatic areas in five patients. These lesions all regressed and were asymptomatic at a mean follow-up of 23 months in all but one patient. However, these lesions required multiple treatments as additional areas became problematic.\nEthanol sclerosis is a well-tolerated, safe, and effective adjunct to the management of VMs. Advantages of ethanol injection include the ability to treat a very localized area without an incision. Conversely, extensive lesions may be palliated as symptoms occur.",

Simultaneously, a valve-containing vein segment was harvested from the opposite SFV or external jugular vein (n = 1) and cryopreserved. Three weeks later a blood type-matched cryopreserved valve was transplanted to the insufficient SFV aided by a low-flow (n = 4) or high-flow (n = 4) dAVF. The fistula was ligated in 3 to 6 weeks, and venous indexes (T2) were obtained 3 weeks later. Analysis of variances compared the venous indexes at T0, T1, and T2 for statistical significance. Gross and histologic inspection assessed valve integrity.\nTwo valves aided by a low-flow dAVF exhibited thrombosis and scarring. The hemodynamics of the six remaining valves demonstrated normalization of the VRT90, an AVP consistent with insufficiency, and a VFT between normal and total venous insufficiency.

    "abstract": "Venous thrombosis is associated with a significant inflammatory response, which can be visualized by gadolinium magnetic resonance venography (MRV). Gadolinium extravasates into tissue during inflammation, producing perithrombus enhancement on magnetic resonance scanning. This study determines (1) whether gadolinium enhancement occurs during deep venous thrombosis (DVT); and (2) whether this enhancement changes with time and can therefore establish the age of thrombus.\nPatients with a diagnosis of iliofemoral DVT by duplex ultrasound who were referred for MRV to document central thrombus extent were studied. T1 weighted images were obtained before and after gadolinium injection (0.1 mmol/kg); repeat scans were obtained up to 3 months thereafter. At the level of maximum thrombus, measurements of signal intensity were made at the periphery (rim), and the center of the thrombosed vein, as well as the contralateral normal vein, on images after gadolinium enhancement. Rim-center vein signal intensity ratios were then calculated and followed.\nA total of 39 scans were obtained in 14 patients (eight men, six women). The thrombosed veins were enlarged, with a peripheral rim of enhancement (\"bull's-eye\" sign). The rim-center ratio for thrombosed veins (2.16 +/- 0.18) was different from that of normal veins (0.66 +/- 0.10; n = 39; p < 0.001). For all acute studies (< or = 14 days) the rim-center ratio was 2.38 +/- 0.17 (n = 31), whereas for all chronic studies (> 14 days) the rim-center ratio was 1.29 +/- 0.44 (n = 8; p = 0.001). Among patients who underwent both early and late studies, the rim-center ratio dropped significantly, from 2.33 +/- 0.20 acutely to 1.29 +/- 0.44 in chronic studies (n = 8; p = 0.03). One patient with active malignancy had a paradoxic increase in rim-center ratio over time and a clinical recurrence of symptoms, suggesting active thrombosis.\nWe conclude that (1) a pattern of peripheral gadolinium enhancement (bull's-eye sign) is seen around acutely thrombosed veins on gadolinium-enhanced MRV, facilitating DVT diagnosis; and (2) the ratio of signal intensity at the rim versus the center of the thrombosed vein may be a good discriminator of acute compared with chronic DVT, which may help direct therapy.",

    "abstract": "Venous compression devices effectively prevent deep venous thrombosis. Recently, because traumatic injury of the limb often precludes application of calf devices, newer methods have been developed that are only applied to the foot. This study was designed to evaluate the venous hemodynamic effects produced by four different compressive devices compared with calf-only intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC).\nTwenty-seven healthy volunteers had application of each device followed by duplex scanning determination of the venous hemodynamics at the popliteal vein (PV) and the common femoral vein (CFV). Endpoints included (1) resting (peak) systolic velocity (RSV); (2) maximum venous velocity (MVV) during device activation; (3) acceleration, the slope of the line from RSV to MVV; and (4) return time (RT) from MVV back to RSV. The devices evaluated included two commercially available mechanical foot devices, (1) foot compressive device (FCD1), and (2) FCD2; (3) an experimental mechanical foot device (FCD3); (4) an experimental pneumatic foot device (FCD4); and (5) a calf-only IPC device (IPC).\nThe RSV was higher in the CFV than the PV. The initial RSV was not statistically significant between the five experimental groups (p = 0.37) at either the PV or CFV, although the RSV was higher in the CFV than in the calf (CFV, 24.3 +/- 6.7 cm/sec; PV, 12.5 +/- 3.7 cm/sec; p < 0.0001). MVV was significantly higher with FCD2 and the IPC (p = 0.0002) at the PV level, but this difference decreased at the CFV. Acceleration was greatest with the two available foot devices, FCD1 and FCD2, compared with the other three devices (p < 0.0001) at both levels. On the other hand, the RT was significantly longer only with the IPC; RT was four to 10 times slower at the PV and three to five times slower at the CFV compared with the other four devices.\nThe two commercially available foot devices, FCD1 and FCD2, and the IPC produced significant alterations in venous hemodynamics. Changes produced at the PV level by both foot and calf devices were seen proximally at the CFV, although the changes were usually less. The mechanical devices produced rapid acceleration of venous flow to an elevated MVV, whereas the IPC produced an elevated peak with a sustained period of flow above baseline (RT). Further clinical comparison should be completed before widespread adaptation of these devices as an equivalent to existing IPC devices.",

    "abstract": "In spite of its invasiveness, measurement of ambulatory venous pressure (AVP) is widely considered the gold standard measurement of venous function. We studied a technique for noninvasive ultrasonographic AVP determination in superficial venous incompetence.\nA linear relationship between venous pressure (measured by echo-guided venous puncture) and diameter (measured by transverse axis duplex imaging) was preliminarily demonstrated with multiple measurements in different conditions (supine, sitting, standing, and Trendelenburg positions, after exercise with and without cuff occlusion) in a saphenous tract at the thigh of 82 limbs in which reflux had been previously demonstrated. Then AVP was measured in another group of 44 patients who had demonstrated superficial venous incompetence, both with and without proximal occlusion, using again the same invasive method and a new noninvasive technique. The latter technique consisted in the construction of a linear diameter/pressure curve obtained after saphenous diameter (by high-resolution sonography) and noninvasive pressure (using hydrostatic values) determinations in the sitting and standing positions. Further measurement of saphenous diameter after standardized exercise permits extrapolation of the AVP values from the curve.\nLinear regression analysis demonstrates that (1) beginning from 20 mm Hg, the pressure/diameter relationship of the incompetent greater saphenous vein is linear; and (2) AVP values derived invasively and noninvasively are significantly correlated (r = 0.7347 and p < 0.0001 for AVP derived without occlusion; r = 0.7270 and p < 0.0001 for values recorded with occlusion).\nThe proposed technique appears able to reliably assess noninvasively AVP values in superficial venous incompetence. In addition, it can be performed with equipment that is widely used for vascular investigations.",

The purpose of this investigation was to quantify differences in endothelial cell structure and local cell type with emphasis on leukocytes and their relationship to arterioles, capillaries, and postcapillary venules (PCVs).\nTwo 4.0 mm punch biopsies were obtained from areas of dermal stasis skin changes in the gaiter region of the leg, as well as from noninvolved areas of skin in the ipsilateral thigh, from 35 patients: CEAP class 4 (11 patients), class 5 (9 patients), class 6 (10 patients), and five normal skin biopsies from patients without chronic venous insufficiency. Electron microscopy was performed on sections at 6700x and 23,800x magnification. At 6700x endothelial cell thickness was determined, and the number of fibroblasts, leukocytes, and mast cells were recorded relative to their proximity to arterioles, capillaries, and PCVs. Similarly, at 23,800x endothelial cell vesicle density, interendothelial junctional widths, and basal lamina thickness (cuff width) were measured. Preliminary evaluation for the presence of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) was performed on three patients using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\nQuantitative measurements demonstrated increased mast cell content for class 4 and 5 patients around arterioles and PCVs and increased macrophage numbers for class 6 patients around PCVs (p < 0.05). Fibroblasts were the most common cells observed; however, no differences were demonstrated between groups. No differences were observed in interendothelial junctional widths or vesicle densities in arterioles, capillaries, or PCVs. Basal lamina thickness was increased only at the capillary level (p < 0.05). The results of RT-PCR for TGF-beta 1 messenger RNA were positive in the three patients studied.\nOur data suggest that (1) mast cells play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic venous insufficiency; (2) the effects of mast cells, macrophages, or both may be mediated in part by TGF-beta 1; and (3) capillary cuff formation is not associated with widened interendothelial gap junctions, but may be a result of enhanced vesicular transport rate or conformational changes in the interendothelial glycocalyx.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to determine the detailed anatomy of the thoracic outlet in normal subjects using helical computed tomography (CT), with particular attention to vascular compression with arm movement.\nTen volunteers underwent detailed clinical evaluation and helical CT scanning of the upper thorax and neck with the arm in a neutral position and with the arm abducted 90 degrees or greater and externally rotated. Anterior scalene-clavicle distance (SC), costoclavicular distance (CC), and vessel diameters were measured with electronic calipers in each position. Comparisons were made with Student's t test.\nWith abduction the SC decreased from 18.4 +/- 3.9 mm to 5.2 +/- 2.4 mm (p < 0.001), and the CC decreased from 12.6 +/- 2.7 mm to 6.3 +/- 3.3 mm (p = 0.005). At these same anatomic planes, the vein diameter decreased from 11.0 +/- 1.6 mm at the neutral position to 5.1 +/- 1.5 mm (p < 0.001) and from 16.1 +/- 3.0 mm to 7.4 +/- 2.6 mm with the arm abducted (p < 0.001). The artery diameter changed from 6.6 +/- 0.8 mm to 6.2 +/- 0.5 mm (p = 0.08) and from 7.2 +/- 0.8 mm to 6.0 +/- 0.5 mm (p = 0.001) with arm movement.\nBoth the distances between the anterior scalene muscle and the clavicle and between the clavicle and the first rib are significantly reduced with abduction of the upper extremity. Venous compression is universal at both the SC and CC spaces in normal subjects with this maneuver. Arterial narrowing occurs less frequently and appears to be minor. Minor changes in these thoracic outlet dimensions (SC/CC) may produce venous compression without movement.",

    "abstract": "The clinical significance of isolated calf vein thrombosis (CVT), particularly with respect to development of the postthrombotic syndrome, remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to define the early natural history of CVT in relation to persistent lower extremity symptoms, propagation, recanalization, and the development of valvular incompetence.\nOver a 116-month period, 499 patients with acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) were referred to our research laboratory, of whom 58 (12%) had thrombosis confined to the calf veins of at least one extremity. The lower extremities of 268 patients (29 with isolated CVT) were followed-up clinically and with duplex ultrasonography at intervals of 1 day, 7 days, 1 month, every 3 months for the first year, and yearly thereafter.\nSeventy percent of extremities with CVT were symptomatic at presentation. Although the prevalence of clinical signs and symptoms decreased to 29% by 1 month, 23% of patients had persistent pain, edema, or both at 12 months. In contrast, 9% of uninvolved extremities contralateral to a CVT and 54% of extremities with proximal DVT remained symptomatic at 1 year (p = 0.004). Recanalization proceeded rapidly such that the mean thrombus load was reduced by 50% at 1 month and to zero at 1 year. The prevalence of valvular incompetence progressively increased such that reflux was present in 24% of extremities at 1 year. Although its investigation was not a primary goal of this study, pulmonary embolism was diagnosed at presentation and during follow-up in 11% and 3% of patients, respectively.\nThe natural history of CVT is complicated by persistent symptoms and the development of valvular incompetence in approximately one-quarter of patients. This potential for persistent lower extremity symptoms should be considered in evaluating the clinical relevance of isolated calf vein DVT.",

Although the prevalence of clinical signs and symptoms decreased to 29% by 1 month, 23% of patients had persistent pain, edema, or both at 12 months. In contrast, 9% of uninvolved extremities contralateral to a CVT and 54% of extremities with proximal DVT remained symptomatic at 1 year (p = 0.004). Recanalization proceeded rapidly such that the mean thrombus load was reduced by 50% at 1 month and to zero at 1 year. The prevalence of valvular incompetence progressively increased such that reflux was present in 24% of extremities at 1 year. Although its investigation was not a primary goal of this study, pulmonary embolism was diagnosed at presentation and during follow-up in 11% and 3% of patients, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Posterolateral thigh perforator (PLTP) veins are part of the lateral thigh venous system, which in most people remains undeveloped. This study was designed to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of these veins.\nOver the past 6 years, 2820 lower limbs with signs and symptoms of chronic venous disease (CVD) were evaluated for venous reflux using color flow duplex imaging. Superficial, perforating, and deep veins were examined in the standing, sitting, and reversed Trendelenburg positions. PLTP veins were best identified in the standing position with the patient facing away from the examiner.\nTwenty-six incompetent PLTP veins were found in 24 limbs (0.85%) of 21 patients (mean age, 43 +/- 16 years; range, 22 to 77 years). All PLTP veins pierced the fascia lata 12 to 25 cm (mean, 16 +/- 3 cm) above the popliteal skin crease in the lateral aspect of the thigh. At this level, the PLTP veins dove posteriorly 3 to 8 cm to join primarily tributaries of the deep femoral vein, superficial femoral vein, or both. Eight PLTP veins were duplicated at 1 to 2 cm below the fascia. Seven PLTP veins gave rise to superficial tributaries that were extended to the lower lateral and posterior thigh, whereas the remaining 19 PLTP veins gave rise to tributaries alongside the lesser saphenous vein and the anterior arch of the greater saphenous vein. On nine occasions, reflux was found in the PLTP veins and their associated tributaries alone. In all of these cases, reflux was adequately controlled with a tourniquet placed distal to the fascial defect. In the remaining 17 PLTP veins, reflux was also seen in the greater saphenous vein, the lesser saphenous vein, or both. None of the limbs that had PLTP vein reflux alone exceeded CVD class 3. When PLTP vein reflux was combined with saphenous reflux, there were five limbs classified as CVD class 4 and one limb each as CVD classes 5 and 6. Twenty limbs underwent ligation and stripping of the varicosities. Three of the earlier patients in the series underwent incomplete operations, which resulted in immediate residual varicosities from the PLTP tributaries. All three patients underwent reoperation successfully within a year.\nThe prevalence of PLTP vein reflux is quite low. Reflux in the PLTP veins alone is associated with mild to moderate clinical presentation. However, when it is combined with saphenous reflux skin damage can be present. Failure to recognize PLTP veins may result in an incomplete or unnecessary operation, leaving the patients with residual varicose veins.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to identify the origin of lower limb primary venous reflux in asymptomatic young individuals and to compare patterns of reflux with age-matched subjects with prominent or clinically apparent varicose veins.\nForty age- and sex-matched subjects with no symptoms (age, 15 to 35 years; 80 limbs; group A), 20 subjects (age, 19 to 32 years; 40 limbs) with prominent but nonvaricose veins (n = 26 limbs; group B), and 50 patients (age, 17 to 34 years; 100 limbs) with varicose veins (n = 64; group C) were examined with color flow duplex imaging. All proximal veins (above popliteal skin crease), superficial, perforator, and deep, in the lower limb were examined in the standing position, and all the distal veins in the sitting position. Patients who had a documented episode of superficial or deep vein thrombosis, previous venous surgery, or injection sclerotherapy were excluded from the study.\nThe prevalence of reflux in group A was 14% (11 of 80), in group B 77% (31 of 40), and in group C 87% (87 of 100). In more than 80% of limbs in the three groups, reflux was confined to the superficial veins alone. Deep venous reflux or combined patterns of reflux were uncommon even in group C. Reflux was detected in all segments of the saphenous veins and their tributaries. In the 125 limbs that had superficial venous incompetence, the below-knee segment of the greater saphenous vein was the most common site of reflux (85, 68%), followed by the above-knee segment of greater saphenous vein (69, 55%) and the saphenofemoral junction (41, 32%). Nonsaphenous reflux was rare (3, 2.4%). Reflux in the lesser saphenous vein (21, 17%) was seen in all groups, whereas involvement of both greater and lesser saphenous veins (8, 6.4%) was seen in group C alone. The incidence of multisegmental reflux was significantly higher in group C (61 of 64, 95%) than in group A (two of 11, 18%) or group B (14 of 26, 54%). The prevalence of distal reflux was comparable in all groups.\nPrimary venous reflux can occur in any superficial or deep vein of the lower limbs. The below-knee veins are often involved in asymptomatic individuals and in those who have prominent or varicose veins. These data suggest that reflux appears to be a local or multifocal process in addition to or separate from a retrograde process.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to report the repair of an aneurysm of the internal carotid artery using the endoluminal method.\nA 70-year-old male patient noted a swelling in the right side of his neck 22 years after endarterectomy of the right internal carotid artery. Duplex ultrasound confirmed the clinical diagnosis of aneurysm of the internal carotid artery. Further investigation included contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scanning and carotid angiography performed via a retrograde femoral approach. The aneurysm contained thrombus and was 3 cm in diameter and in length. It extended superiorly from a point 0.5 cm above the carotid bifurcation to a point estimated to be 2 cm from the base of the skull. Repair of the aneurysm was undertaken using the endoluminal method. A self-expanding endograft 8 mm in diameter and 4 cm in length was introduced through a 12F sheath in the common carotid artery. An on-table completion angiogram of the right-sided extracranial carotid arteries and the intracranial internal carotid artery and branches was obtained.\nThe completion angiogram and postoperative CT scan confirmed exclusion of the aneurysm sac from the circulation. The patient awoke from anesthesia with complete paralysis of the left arm. Recovery of movement commenced 1 hour later. A brain CT scan demonstrated the event to be an embolic stroke. Strength had returned by 7 days. Function of the arm was good 1 month after operation, but coordination for fine movements was lacking. At the 6-month follow-up, good arm function was maintained. A duplex ultrasound scan demonstrated not only continued exclusion of the aneurysm sac but occlusion of the endograft, also.\nEndoluminal repair of aneurysms of the internal carotid artery is feasible but carries the risk of major morbidity as a result of peripheral embolization and early occlusion of the endograft.",

    "abstract": "Subfascial division of incompetent perforating veins plays an important role in the surgical treatment of patients with venous ulceration of the lower leg. To minimize the high incidence of postoperative wound complications after open exploration, endoscopic approaches have recently been developed. We carried out a prospective, randomized comparison of open and endoscopic treatment of these patients that was aimed at ulcer healing and postoperative wound complications.\nPatients with current venous ulceration on the medial side of the lower leg were randomly allocated to open exploration by the modified Linton approach or endoscopic exploration by use of a mediastinoscope.\nThirty-nine patients were randomized, 19 to open exploration and 20 to endoscopic exploration. The incidence of wound infections after open exploration was 53%, compared with 0% in the endoscopic group (p < 0.001). Patients in the open group needed longer hospital stays (mean, 7 days; range, 3 to 39 days) than patients in the endoscopic group (mean, 4 days; range, 2 to 6 days; p = 0.001). Four months after operation, the ulcers of 17 patients (90%) in the open group and 17 patients (85%) in the endoscopic group had healed. During a mean follow-up of 21 months (range, 16 to 29 months), no recurrences were noticed in either group.\nEndoscopic division of incompetent perforating veins is equally as effective as open surgical exploration for the treatment of venous ulceration of the lower leg but leads to significantly fewer wound healing complications. Endoscopic division is therefore the preferred method.",

    "abstract": "Protamine reversal of heparin anticoagulation during cardiovascular surgery may cause severe hypotension and pulmonary hypertension. A novel protamine variant, [+18RGD], has been developed that effectively reverses heparin anticoagulation without toxicity in canine experiments. Heretofore, human studies have not been undertaken. This investigation hypothesized that [+18RGD] would effectively reverse heparin anticoagulation of human blood in vitro.\nFifty patients who underwent anticoagulation therapy during vascular surgery had blood sampled at baseline and 30 minutes after receiving heparin (150 IU/kg). Activated clotting times were used to define specific quantities of [+18RGD] or protamine necessary to completely reverse heparin anticoagulation in the blood sample of each patient. These defined amounts of [+18RGD] or protamine were then administered to the heparinized blood samples, and percent reversals of activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin clotting time, and antifactor Xa/IIa levels were determined. In addition, platelet aggregation assays, as well as platelet and white blood cell counts were performed.\n[+18RGD] and protamine were equivalent in reversing heparin as assessed by thrombin clotting time, antifactor Xa, antifactor IIa levels, and white blood cell changes. [+18RGD], when compared with protamine, was superior in this regard, as assessed by activated partial thromboplastin time (94.5 +/- 1.0 vs 86.5 +/- 1.3% delta, respectively; p < 0.001) and platelet declines (-3.9 +/- 2.9 vs -12.8 +/- 3.4 per mm3, respectively; p = 0.048). Platelet aggregation was also decreased for [+18RGD] compared with protamine (23.6 +/- 1.5 vs 28.5 +/- 1.9%, respectively; p = 0.048).\n[+18RGD] was as effective as protamine for in vitro reversal of heparin anticoagulation by most coagulation assays, was statistically more effective at reversal than protamine by aPTT assay, and was associated with lesser platelet reductions than protamine. [+18RGD], if less toxic than protamine in human beings, would allow for effective clinical reversal of heparin anticoagulation.",

    "abstract": "Most studies of sutures used in vascular surgery have used steadily applied loads. But in vivo, sutures are subject to pulsatile pressures. Pulsatile pressures could weaken sutures, or they could be beneficial by helping to slide the suture, thereby equilibrating the tension between unevenly tightened loops. This study examined the effect of pulsatile pressures on the strength and movement of polypropylene (Prolene) sutures.\nSegments of pig thoracic aorta were cannulated and studied in a tissue bath in vitro at 37 degrees C. A longitudinal arteriotomy was made and then closed with running 6-0 Prolene. Vessels were subjected to (1) no pressure; (2) 100 mm Hg steady pressure; or (3) 112/65 mm Hg pulsatile pressure. After 48 hours the sutures were studied for breaking strength. In a second, separate set of experiments, longitudinal arteriotomies were closed using running suture lines. These were constructed with either several loose loops or several overly tight loops. Fine wires were affixed to the suture loops to permit photographic recording of suture movement.\nThere was no difference in breaking force among 68 sutures that had been subjected to (1) no pressure; (2) 100 mm Hg steady pressure; or (3) 112/65 mm Hg pulsatile pressure. These also were no different than sutures that were not sewn into arteries. These findings indicate that neither steady nor pulsatile pressures weaken Prolene sutures. In the second set of experiments, it was found that pulsatile pressure did cause movement of suture lines where there were loose loops (p < 0.05). However, neither steady nor pulsatile pressures caused movement of loops in suture lines that contained normal and overly tight loops.\nNeither steady nor pulsatile physiologic pressures weaken 6-0 Prolene sutures that have been used to close a longitudinal arteriotomy. These pressures can cause movement of loose suture lines, but do not equilibrate the tension between normal and overly tight suture loops. Overly tight loops may place excessive load on a suture line.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether graft revision on the basis of a duplex scan alone without an arteriogram is effective in identifying graft stenosis and allowing for repair to preserve bypass graft patency.\nFrom 1994 to 1997, all patients in whom infrainguinal grafts were placed at a University-affiliated teaching hospital were entered into a prospective protocol using duplex scanning to detect stenotic lesions. Studies were performed after the operation, at 1 month, at 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. All grafts were composed of reversed autogenous vein and were placed subcutaneously to allow for easier monitoring and correction. Patients who had failing grafts underwent operative correction without preoperative arteriography.\nDuring this interval, 48 lesions in 31 grafts were repaired. The indication for repair was a velocity ratio greater than 2.5 in all patients and greater than 3.0 for 43 lesions. Forty-four lesions had a peak systolic velocity greater than 250 cm/sec. Twenty-nine lesions reduced the distal graft velocity to less than 45 cm/sec. Sixteen lesions involved the proximal anastomosis, 26 the body of the graft, three the distal anastomosis, two involved inflow arteries, and one affected the outflow vessel. Repair included patch angioplasty for 39 lesions, resection with interposition graft for five, a proximal jump graft for three, and a distal extension graft for one. The severity and location of the stenosis was confirmed at operation in all cases. Twenty-eight of the 31 patients (90%) are currently alive, and follow-up on these patients has ranged from 5 to 36 months (mean, 19 months). Twenty-nine of the 31 grafts (94%) remained patent, with a 92% patency rate by life table analysis at 3 years. Follow-up duplex scans found improvement in the ankle-brachial index (mean increase, 0.33) and distal graft velocity (mean increase, 43 cm/sec) in all patients. After repair, 27 patients had a distal graft velocity greater than 45 cm/sec and no patient had a velocity ratio greater than 1.5. Complications included wound infection in two patients and bleeding that required reoperation in one. All symptomatic patients had clinical improvement, and none required early reexploration for residual stenosis.\nGraft repair may be safely performed on the basis of duplex scanning alone with preservation of bypass patency and correction of hemodynamic deterioration. Duplex scanning can detect inflow or outflow disease in addition to intrinsic graft stenoses and can identify sequential lesions, eliminating the need for, expense of, and risk of arteriography.",

    "abstract": "To compare dialysis access patency rates and identify risk factors for failure.\nAll access procedures at our institution from 1987 to 1996 were reviewed. Primary procedures were surgically implanted dual-lumen central venous hemodialysis catheters (SIHCs), peritoneal dialysis catheters (PDCs), arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs), and prosthetic shunts (PTFEs).\nFive hundred eighty-five primary procedures (236 PTFEs, 87 AVFs, 112 SIHCs, and 150 PDCs) and 259 secondary procedures (215 PTFEs, 14 AVFs, 0 SIHCs, and 30 PDCs) were performed on 350 patients. By life table analysis, SIHCs exhibited the lowest primary patency rate (9% at 1 year; p < 0.0001), whereas PDCs had the highest primary patency rate (57% at 1 year; p < 0.02). The primary patency rates of AVFs and PTFEs was similar, with 43% and 41% 1-year patency rates, respectively (p = 0.70). Less-stringent reporting methods would have increased apparent 1-year patency rates by 9% to 41%. With regard to secondary patency, there was no significant difference between PTFEs and PDCs, with 1-year patency rates of 59% and 70%, respectively (p = 0.62), but PTFEs were more frequently revised. In addition, there was no significant difference between AVF and PTFE secondary patency rates, with 1-year patency rates of 46% and 59%, respectively. Early differences in patency rates for AVFs, PTFEs, and PDCs diminished over time, and at 4 years AVFs had the best secondary patency rate (p = 0.6). The most common reasons for access failure were: PTFEs, thrombosis; AVFs, thrombosis and failure to mature; SIHCs, inadequate dialysis; PDCs, infection and inadequate exchange. By regression analysis, a history of a previous unsalvageable PTFE was the only significant risk factor for failure of a subsequent PTFE (p < 0.01), and the risk of graft failure increased exponentially with the number of previous PTFE shunts. Diabetes was the only significant risk factor for failure of PDCs (p < 0.02; odds ratio, 2.0).\nThe patency rate for PTFEs is similar to that for AVFs, but AVFs require fewer revisions. When replacing a failed access graft, the risk of PTFE failure increases with the number of prior unsalvageable PTFE shunts. PDCs have excellent patency rates, but failure rates are doubled in patients with diabetes. Because of poor patency rates and inadequate dialysis flow rates, SIHCs should be avoided when possible. Reporting methods dramatically affect apparent patency rates, and reporting standards are needed to allow meaningful comparisons in the dialysis access literature.",

By life table analysis, SIHCs exhibited the lowest primary patency rate (9% at 1 year; p < 0.0001), whereas PDCs had the highest primary patency rate (57% at 1 year; p < 0.02). The primary patency rates of AVFs and PTFEs was similar, with 43% and 41% 1-year patency rates, respectively (p = 0.70). Less-stringent reporting methods would have increased apparent 1-year patency rates by 9% to 41%. With regard to secondary patency, there was no significant difference between PTFEs and PDCs, with 1-year patency rates of 59% and 70%, respectively (p = 0.62), but PTFEs were more frequently revised. In addition, there was no significant difference between AVF and PTFE secondary patency rates, with 1-year patency rates of 46% and 59%, respectively. Early differences in patency rates for AVFs, PTFEs, and PDCs diminished over time, and at 4 years AVFs had the best secondary patency rate (p = 0.6). The most common reasons for access failure were: PTFEs, thrombosis; AVFs, thrombosis and failure to mature; SIHCs, inadequate dialysis; PDCs, infection and inadequate exchange. By regression analysis, a history of a previous unsalvageable PTFE was the only significant risk factor for failure of a subsequent PTFE (p < 0.01), and the risk of graft failure increased exponentially with the number of previous PTFE shunts. Diabetes was the only significant risk factor for failure of PDCs (p < 0.02; odds ratio, 2.0).",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease commonly involves the infragenicular arterial tree. Our study evaluated the effect of interleukin (IL)-1 beta on the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) derived from atherosclerotic infragenicular arteries of human subjects who underwent below-knee amputation, as well as the role of IL-1 beta in VSMCs' production of extracellular matrix components, substances that are important in the transformation of VSMCs from the contractile to the synthetic phenotype. This transformation to the synthetic phenotype is an important step in the formation of the atherosclerotic lesion.\nCultures were identified as being of smooth muscle origin through staining with the cytoskeletal marker, alpha-smooth muscle actin. Proliferation assays were performed by seeding confluent cultures of passages 4 to 7 into six-well plates at 10,000 cells per well. After serum starvation, samples were incubated with IL-1 beta (1 ng/ml). Cell number was determined on a daily basis. To study extracellular matrix production, cells were propagated in tissue culture chamber slides in the absence or presence of growth media containing IL-1 beta. After fixation with 100% methanol, each sample was stained with a primary antibody specific for an extracellular matrix component. After staining with the fluorescein-tagged secondary antibody, each sample was examined using immunofluorescent microscopic examination.\nThe results of our proliferation assays showed that IL-1 beta caused a significant increase in the proliferation of VSMCs at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours (p < or = 0.003 when comparing IL-1 beta-treated samples with control specimens at each time period using unpaired t test). The number of IL-1 beta-treated cells at 96 hours was double the number present in the control samples (16,033 +/- 238 vs 8102 +/- 824). When compared with control samples, IL-1 beta was found to affect the production of extracellular matrix proteins by infragenicular VSMCs. IL-1 beta caused an increase in the production of fibronectin, a decrease in the production of laminin, and no change in the production of collagen type IV.\nThese results suggest that interleukin-1 beta acts as a potent stimulant of the proliferation of human infragenicular VSMCs. IL-1 beta also acts to augment the production of fibronectin by these cells. Fibronectin has been implicated in the phenotypic transformation of VSMCs from the contractile to the synthetic state. Therefore, IL-1 beta may serve as an important regulatory factor in the development of atherosclerosis by stimulating the proliferation of VSMCs and their transformation to the synthetic state, two important steps in the formation of the atherosclerotic lesion.",

    "abstract": "Although the slow healing rate of venous ulcers is well known, the underlying defect in the healing process is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the cellular characteristics of fibroblasts taken from venous ulcers (wound-fb) and compare them with the fibroblasts of normal tissue (normal-fb).\nBiopsy specimens were obtained from wound margins and normal tissue of the upper thigh in each patient. Dermal fibroblasts were isolated from explant cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. These cells were then plated at 1000 cells per plate, and total cells per plate were counted over time so that growth curves could be generated. In further experimentation, media was supplemented with additional calf serum (20%, 30%, 40%, 50%) and growth factors (epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, interleukin-1 beta) in an attempt to stimulate growth.\nTwo major differences were noted: (1) normal-fb replicated more rapidly than wound-fb; and (2) the morphologic features of wound-fb were different. Normal-fb were compact and tapered, with well-defined nuclear morphologic features. Wound-fb were larger and polygonal in shape, with less-uniform nuclear morphologic features. Additional calf serum in tissue culture media enhanced normal-fb growth but had no effect on wound-fb. Supplementation of media with growth factors stimulated the growth of wound-fb. Statistically significant differences were noted at day 10 and 14 with basic fibroblast growth factor supplementation (p = 0.02 and 0.0001, respectively) and at day 14 with epidermal growth factor (p = 0.008). Although interleukin-1 beta stimulated cell growth in five of six patients, the differences observed were not statistically significant.\nOur data demonstrate that wound-fb proliferate at a slower rate and are morphologically distinct from normal-fb. These characteristics are typical of aged or senescent cells. This decreased growth can be stimulated by growth factors basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and interleukin-1 beta. Slowed growth may be partially responsible for the defect in healing of venous stasis ulcers. Furthermore, we believe that in some patients ulcer healing may be improved by exogenous provision of specific growth factors.",

    "abstract": "We describe a technique of superficial venous transposition in the forearm used for the formation of an arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis access. These modifications of the single-incision radiocephalic fistula are designed to increase options for arteriovenous fistulas by using veins and arteries that are suitable for use but are not in immediate proximity.\nArteries and veins suitable for a primary arteriovenous fistula were identified and mapped using duplex ultrasound in 89 patients. Separate incisions were used in the majority of cases, and the selected forearm vein was mobilized, angiodilated, and transposed into a subcutaneous tunnel on the volar aspect of the forearm. Before initiation of hemodialysis, duplex ultrasound scanning was performed, and the location that was most suitable for cannulation was identified. Repeat scans were performed at 3-month intervals for analysis of patency.\nSuperficial venous transpositions were performed using a single incision in 13 instances in which the vein was in immediate proximity to the radial artery (type A). Dorsal-to-volar forearm transposition (type B) was performed in 30 veins with anastomoses to the radial (n = 26), ulnar (n = 2), or brachial (n = 2) arteries. Volar-to-volar forearm transposition (type C) was performed in the remaining 46 veins, with anastomoses to the radial (n = 42), ulnar (n = 2), or brachial arteries (n = 2). Successful hemodialysis was accomplished in 81 of 89 patients (91%). The primary cumulative patency rate was 84% at 1 year and 69% at 2 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 14.3 months.\nThe use of superficial venous transposition for the formation of autogenous hemoaccess was associated with ease of cannulation by dialysis personnel, high maturation rates, reduced early failure rates, and enhanced patency rates. We recommended the use of these technical modifications to increase the use of autogenous fistulas in the forearm.",

    "abstract": "This report summarizes our experience in evaluating a series of 168 patients who underwent a total of 175 carotid endarterectomy procedures under local anesthesia. Patients were monitored by stump pressure (SP) measurement and transcranial Doppler scanning (TCD). The need for shunting was compared between SP/TCD flow velocity reduction and the awake response (gold standard).\nThe study cohort represented 56% of all the carotid patients treated during the study period. Clamping ischemia was defined as the appearance of focal deficit (focal ischemia) or unconsciousness (global deficit) on carotid clamping. In the case of clamping ischemia, a shunt was inserted. To define the optimal value of SP and TCD flow velocity that is able to discriminate patients with clamping ischemia, a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed. Sensitivity and specificity tests, together with negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV), were calculated. Cutoff values were defined as the ROC curve values that correlated the highest sensitivity with the highest specificity for both SP and TCD.\nClamping ischemia was present in 18 procedures (10%) in which a shunt was used. No perioperative deaths were recorded. Major perioperative morbidity occurred in one patient (0.6%). Two nondisabling strokes were also recorded (1.8% overall rate of neurologic morbidity). Cutoff values for both SP and TCD, using the ROC curve, were < or = 50 mm Hg and > or = 70% flow velocity reduction from baseline, respectively. SP values of < or = 50 mm Hg or less showed a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 83%, a PPV of 40%, and an NPV of 100%. TCD flow monitoring (> or = 70% flow reduction) revealed a lower sensitivity (83%) but a greater ability to avoid false positive results (96% specificity), resulting in increased PPV (71%) and NPV (98%). Combining SP and TCD failed to provide better results in terms of specificity (81%) and PPV (38%).\nSP measurement using a 50 mm Hg cutoff appears to be a reliable predictor of clamping ischemia but requires the use of a shunt in 17% of the patients who would otherwise not require this procedure. In contrast, TCD has greater specificity but is associated with a lower sensitivity, with 17% false negative results. In our experience, both SP and TCD show limitations, as they overestimate or underestimate carotid endarterectomy procedures in need of a shunt. We believe that sensitivity is more important than specificity in carotid endarterectomy, and thus conclude that TCD flow velocity measurement is not an optimal method for detecting clamping ischemia.",

The late stroke rate was increased in patients who had residual or recurrent lesions compared with those who had normal duplex study results (18% vs 6%; p = 0.16) and was related to the ipsilateral artery.\nRecurrent lesions that remain asymptomatic can be managed without operation with likelihood of success in the near term (5 years). However, these patients are at increased risk of late stroke, and almost half will eventually require operation. Therefore, in good-risk patients operation for asymptomatic restenosis should be considered.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of successful surgical management of a potentially life-threatening complication of aortoiliac stent placement. A 59-year-old man who had Leriche syndrome underwent bilateral iliac artery and infrarenal aortic stent placement at another institution. His history was significant for retroperitoneal lymph node dissection at 19 years of age for testicular cancer. One week after stent placement, the patient was readmitted with abdominal pain, poor oral intake, and diffuse intermittent tenderness. Evaluation with computed tomographic scanning and endoscopy was unremarkable, and the patient was discharged. He was admitted to our institution 1 week later with persistent abdominal pain. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen revealed a large pseudoaneurysm of the abdominal aorta. The patient underwent urgent exploration, and exclusion of his infrarenal aorta was achieved with aortobifemoral bypass grafting. After the operation, the patient's course was complicated by a large paraduodenal hematoma, which resulted in a gastric outlet obstruction, which was managed without operation. This case illustrates a potential life-threatening complication of extensive stent placement for aortoiliac occlusive disease. Injury to the abdominal aorta must be considered in a symptomatic patient after the placement of stents in the aortoiliac region, beyond the immediate periprocedural period.",

    "abstract": "Renal failure remains a common and morbid complication after complex aortic surgery. This study was performed to identify perioperative factors that contribute to postoperative renal failure.\nThe perioperative outcomes of 183 patients who underwent thoracoabdominal aortic surgery with supraceliac clamping were reviewed. During the interval from Jan. 1987 to Nov. 1996, thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair was performed in 154 patients (type I, 49 patients [27%]; type II, 21 patients [11.5%]; type III, 55 patients [30%]; type IV, 29 patients [16%]), suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in 17 patients (9%), and visceral/renal revascularization procedures in 12 patients (6.5%). Intraoperative management included thoracoabdominal aortic exposure and clamp-and-sew technique with renal artery cold perfusion whenever the renal arteries were accessible (79% of cases).\nRelevant clinical features included preoperative hypertension (85%), diabetes mellitus (8%), single functioning kidney (10%), recent intravenous contrast injection (34%), renal insufficiency (creatinine level greater than 1.5 mg/dl; 24%), and emergent operation (19%). Acute renal failure, defined as both a doubling of serum creatinine level and an absolute value greater than 3.0 mg/dl, occurred in 21 patients (11.5%), of whom five required hemodialysis (2.7%). Variables associated with this complication included a preoperative creatinine level greater than 1.5 mg/dl (p = 0.004) and a total cross-clamp time greater than 100 minutes (p = 0.035). The operative mortality risk (within 30 days; 8%) was significantly increased with renal failure (odds ratio, 9.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 33; p < 0.005).\nRenal failure, although uncommon in contemporary practice, greatly increases the risk of early death after thoracoabdominal aortic surgery. The overall incidence of renal failure and dialysis requirement in the present series compare favorably with those reported using other operative techniques, specifically partial left heart bypass and distal aortic perfusion. These data suggest that patients who have preoperative renal insufficiency are prone to postoperative renal failure. Furthermore, regional hypothermic perfusion and minimal clamp times are important elements in the prevention of renal failure after thoracoabdominal aortic surgery.",

    "abstract": "There has been much discussion in the literature of factors that affect the mortality rate of patients who undergo repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Some studies have suggested restricting patient selection for repair on the basis of certain preoperative factors including age, increased creatinine level, low hemoglobin level, loss of consciousness, electrocardiographic changes, and preoperative cormorbid medical conditions. A retrospective review of 96 patients who underwent repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm was performed to determine whether these factors would necessarily be applicable to all populations.\nA retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm was performed over a study period of 20 years. Data was analyzed by both univariate and multivariate analysis.\nThe mean age of the patients was 73 years. The intraoperative mortality rate was 23%. The in-hospital mortality rate was 60.4%, with a 30-day mortality rate of 56.3%. By univariate analysis of various factors associated with the mortality rate, hemoglobin level, creatinine level, lowest preoperative and average intraoperative systolic blood pressure, packed red blood cells transfused, estimated blood loss, intraoperative urine output, and temperature were statistically significant. A history of loss of consciousness was also statistically significant. No preoperative comorbid medical conditions were significant, nor was age. On a multivariate analysis, preoperative factors of loss of consciousness, a lowest preoperative systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, a hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dl, and a creatinine level greater than 1.5 mg/dl were predictive of death. The effects of the hemoglobin level, creatinine level, and loss of consciousness on the mortality rate were strongest in patients who had a lowest preoperative systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg. In patients who had the sets of preoperative factors that were associated with a 100% mortality rate, there were intraoprative factors that influenced their death.\nThese findings suggest that the factors (loss of consciousness, creatinine level, hemoglobin level) that are predictive of death may be a reflection of shock in this patient population. Further studies should be directed to optimizing preoperative resuscitation. Patients who have a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm should not be denied therapy on the basis of any specific set of preoperative factors.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed whether multisegmental disease that is severe enough to require an inflow procedure adversely affects infrainguinal bypass patency, limb salvage, or patient survival rates.\nThe records of 495 patients who underwent 551 infrainguinal bypass grafting procedures were reviewed. Saphenous vein and prosthetic grafts were evaluated separately. Graft patency rates, patient limb salvage rates, and patient survival rates in those grafts that arose from a reconstructed inflow source were compared with those that arose from normal, nonreconstructed inflow sources. When grafts had either hemodynamic failure or occlusion, the cause of failure was identified.\nFour-year primary patency rates in vein grafts that arose from a reconstructed inflow sources were lower than those in grafts that arose from nonreconstructed inflow sources (41% vs 54%; p = 0.006). Assisted primary patency rates and secondary patency rates, however, were similar (62% vs 74% and 64% vs 77%, respectively). The 4-year primary patency rate (45% vs 55%), assisted primary patency rate (60% vs 60%), and secondary patency rate (60% vs 61%) in prosthetic grafts did not vary based on inflow source. The most common cause of graft failure was inflow failure, except in the vein grafts that did not require an inflow procedure, in which the most common cause of failure was graft failure. Inflow failure occurred in 24% and 22% of the vein and prosthetic grafts with multisegmental disease, respectively, but in only 7% (p < 0.001) and 10% (p < 0.05), respectively, of those that arose from normal nonreconstructed inflow. The presence of an inflow procedure did not affect limb salvage rates or patient survival rates, regardless of graft material.\nLong-term patency rates, patient limb salvage rates, and survival rates in patients with a reconstructed inflow source were similar to those of patients with a normal nonreconstructed inflow. A major cause of occlusion is inflow failure, and this occurs in a greater proportion of patients with multisegmental disease. These patients, in particular, may benefit from patient surveillance to screen for progression of their inflow disease and to allow for intervention before infrainguinal graft occlusion.",

    "abstract": "Arm and lesser saphenous veins (ALSVs) are generally considered to be the best alternative for infrapopliteal arterial bypass grafts when greater saphenous vein is not available. The need for additional incisions and repositioning of the patient, along with occasional use of general anesthesia for arm vein harvesting, led to our perception that the use of ALSVs increased operative time and possibly patient discomfort. Therefore, we compared the outcome of ALSVs with that of prosthetic infrapopliteal arterial bypass procedures performed at our hospital.\nBetween July 1, 1991, and Dec. 31, 1996, we performed 96 infrapopliteal arterial bypass procedures using 45 ALSVs (28 arm vein, 17 lesser saphenous) and 51 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts. Seventy grafts were single-length ALSV or PTFE bypass grafts, and 26 grafts were placed as the distal segment of a sequential or composite bypass graft. Every attempt was made to use ALSV and avoid the use of PTFE, even if a short segment of the vein graft measured less than 4.0 mm in diameter. There were no significant differences between patients with ALSV compared with PTFE grafts in terms of age, sex, indication for surgery, or number of previous revascularization procedures (2.1 vs 1.7), respectively (p > 0.05). However, ALSV grafts had more factors associated with an expected worse outcome: they were more commonly anastomosed to pedal arteries (17% [8 of 45] vs 0%; p = 0.0009), less commonly single-segment grafts (62% [28 of 45] vs 82% [42 of 51]; p = 0.03), had higher average runoff resistance values (2.3 vs 1.5; p = 0.001), and were less frequently treated with lifelong warfarin (65% [29 of 45] vs 95% [48 of 51]; p = 0.0001).\nThe hospital mortality rate was 3.1% (3 of 96; 3 PTFE). All deaths were cardiac-related. Despite the potential factors associated with worse patency rates for ALSVs, 2-year assisted primary patency rates tended to be higher for arm veins (46%) than for lesser saphenous veins (23%) and PTFE grafts (26%), although this difference was not statistically significant. Limb salvage rates were similar between ALSV and PTFE grafts (76% vs 71%, respectively). The average operative time was significantly longer for ALSV bypass procedures (mean, 6.2 hours) than for PTFE bypass procedures (mean, 4.9 hours; p = 0.003), and for single-length conduits when revision of previously placed grafts was not attempted, the operative time was 4.0 hours for ALSV grafts and 2.5 hours for PTFE grafts.\nIn our experience ALSV bypass grafts to infrapopliteal arteries do not function as well as reported by some others. In spite of the extra effort involved, arm vein grafts are preferred over PTFE grafts for their likely higher assisted primary patency rates and equivalent, if not better, limb salvage rates.",

Forty-one patients underwent attempted ultrasound-guided pseudoaneurysm compression after cardiac procedures: 19 after cardiac catheterization alone, seven after angioplasty, one after atherectomy, two after insertion and subsequent removal of an intraaortic balloon pump, and 12 after coronary stenting.\nCompression was successful overall in 88% of the patients (36 of 41). Successful compression of the pseudoaneurysm was seen in 95% after catheterization alone, 100% after angioplasty, 100% after atherectomy, and 100% after intraaortic balloon pumping, as compared with 67% after stenting (eight of 12 vs 28 of 29; p = 0.02). A sheath size of 9F or greater was a significant factor in predicting unsuccessful compression (three of eight vs two of 33; p = 0.04). Abnormal coagulation parameters were present in 20 of the 41 patients and was not significantly different in patients who were successfully or unsuccessfully treated (four of five vs 16 of 36; p = 0.40).\nPseudoaneurysms after cardiac procedures and interventions can often be successfully compressed with an ultrasound-guided technique. The presence of abnormal coagulation parameters was not identified as a risk factor for compression failure and should not dissuade attempted compression. Stent placement was more likely to result in unsuccessful compression, and this appeared to be a result of the larger size of the arterial defect. Even in this setting, compression achieved obliteration of the pseudoaneurysm in more than half of the patients.",
