    "abstract": "The purposes of this article are to describe Byzantine varicose vein surgery and to note its influence on the development of these operations after that time. A study and analysis of the original texts of the Byzantine physicians, written in Greek and containing the now mostly lost knowledge of the earlier Hellenistic and Roman periods, was undertaken.\nThe Byzantines paid special attention to varicosis surgery from the early period of the empire. The famous fourth-century (ce) physician Oribasius meticulously described a number of surgical methods of confronting varicosis, some of which were derived from the texts of earlier Greek surgeons, to which he added his own keen observations. Later, eminent Byzantine physicians developed these techniques further and evaluated their usefulness.\nThe study of Byzantine medical texts proves that several surgical techniques on varicosis were widely practiced in Byzantine times and were derived from the work of ancient Greek and Roman physicians. The techniques described had a great influence on western medieval and later European surgery, thus constituting significant roots of modern angiology.",

    "abstract": "Variations in the arterial anatomy of the upper extremities, although uncommon, occur in up to one in five patients. Most of these variants occur in either the radial or ulnar artery; brachial artery variations are less common. The case we report is a rare anomaly consisting of brachial artery agenesis or regression. The brachial artery was absent from its origin but reconstituted as a normal-appearing vessel 3 cm above the antecubital fossa. The profunda brachii artery and the superior and inferior ulnar collateral arteries were also absent in this patient. The axillary artery served as the main collateral to the forearm. This constellation of anomalies has not been previously described or explained by developmental models in humans and other primates. We speculate that failure of development or arrest of specific vascular anlage in the upper extremity occurs at particular embryological stages because of unknown factors.",

After 60 minutes when the perfusion was discontinued, tPA concentrations dropped to 15,931 +/- 4818 ng/mL. In central venous blood, tPA levels increased to a maximum of 230.7 +/- 89.6 ng/mL after 60 minutes of perfusion, which represented 1.4% of the concentration measured in the perfusion solution at the same time. With disconnection of the extracorporeal circuit, the tPA levels in central venous blood decreased rapidly and reached a level of 24.1 +/- 8.7 ng/mL after 120 minutes.\nThe use of regional hyperthermic fibrinolytic perfusion in the treatment of extended deep venous thrombosis makes it possible to achieve extremely high concentrations of tPA in the perfusion solution. At the same time, the entry of the fibrinolytic agent into the systemic circulation is minimized.",

    "abstract": "The phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is altered in several arterial pathologies, including the neointima formed after acute arterial injury. This study examined the time course of this phenotypic change in relation to changes in the amount and distribution of matrix glycosaminoglycans.\nThe immunochemical staining of heparan sulphates (HS) and chondroitin sulphates (CS) in the extracellular matrix of the arterial wall was examined at early points after balloon catheter injury of the rabbit carotid artery. SMC phenotype was assessed by means of ultrastructural morphometry of the cytoplasmic volume fraction of myofilaments. The proportions of cell and matrix components in the media were analyzed with similar morphometric techniques.\nHS and CS were shown in close association with SMCs of the uninjured arterial media as well as being more widespread within the matrix. Within 6 hours after arterial injury, there was loss of the regular pericellular distribution of both HS and CS, which was associated with a significant expansion in the extracellular space. This preceded the change in ultrastructural phenotype of the SMCs. The glycosaminoglycan loss was most exaggerated at 4 days, after which time the HS and CS reappeared around the medial SMCs. SMCs of the recovering media were able to rapidly replace their glycosaminoglycans, whereas SMCs of the developing neointima failed to produce HS as readily as they produced CS.\nThese studies indicate that changes in glycosaminoglycans of the extracellular matrix precede changes in SMC phenotype after acute arterial injury. In the recovering arterial media, SMCs replace their matrix glycosaminoglycans rapidly, whereas the newly established neointima fails to produce similar amounts of heparan sulphates.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the current study was to identify the possible short- and long-term effects of diabetes on the outcome of carotid endarterectomy.\nMedical records were reviewed for 781 carotid endarterectomies (in 734 patients) performed by the same vascular surgeon in a university medical center between January 1994 and December 1998. Patients were divided two groups: those with diabetes (n = 181 patients; 193 operations) and those without diabetes (n = 553; 588 operations). The two groups were similar with respect to mean age, male-female ratio, and contralateral lesions. The only significant differences were a higher prevalence of peripheral vascular disease and dyslipidemia in the diabetic group and a higher prevalence of hemispheric transient ischemic attacks among the nondiabetic patients. Carotid color duplex ultrasound scan had been performed in all patients, and in 56 patients from the diabetic group and 56 patients from the nondiabetic group (matched for age, sex, and contralateral lesions), the distal extension of the lesion from the carotid bifurcation had also been defined. Both of these subgroups were fully representative of their respective groups of origin. Carotid endarterectomy was performed after the induction of general anesthesia; electroencephalographic monitoring was continuous.\nExcept for the significantly higher prevalence of calcified plaques in the diabetic patients (P <.0001), the characteristics of the carotid disease in the two groups were similar. In the 56-member subgroups, 73.2% of the diabetic and 35.7% of the nondiabetic patients (P <.0001) had lesions extending more than 2 cm beyond the carotid bifurcation. Mean length of plaque beyond the bifurcation was 2.3 +/- 0.09 cm for the diabetic and 1.7 +/- 0.08 cm for the nondiabetic patients (P <.0001). Diabetes was the only factor significantly correlated with plaque length. In the diabetic subgroup, surgery was characterized by significantly longer carotid arteriotomies (P =.03) and clamp times (P <.003). Operative mortality was 1.5% in the diabetic group (2 myocardial infarctions + 1 stroke) and 0.5% in the nondiabetic group (1 myocardial infarction + 2 strokes; P value not significant); stroke rates were 1.5% (3 major strokes) and 0.5% (2 major strokes + 1 minor stroke), respectively (P = not significant). Long-term survival (5 years) was not significantly lower among the diabetic patients.\nDiabetes mellitus does not seem to significantly increase the surgical risk for carotid endarterectomy. The presence of more extensive plaques has no significant effect on the results of surgery.",

    "abstract": "This open single-center prospective study aimed to determine the redistribution of blood flow within the circle of Willis and through collateral pathways after carotid endarterectomy. Blood flow velocity and flow direction in the major cerebral arteries were determined, both at rest and during CO(2) inhalation.\nCarotid endarterectomy was performed in 148 patients with a 70% or greater diameter stenosis of the internal carotid artery while patients were under general anesthesia. Arteriotomy closure was done with a venous patch. Selective shunting was performed with an electroencephalogram. Baseline blood flow velocity of the basal cerebral arteries was measured by means of transcranial Doppler sonography preoperatively (within 1 week before surgery) and 3 months postoperatively. At the same times, cerebrovascular reactivity was calculated during CO(2) inhalation insonating both middle cerebral arteries.\nBaseline blood flow velocity in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery hardly changed 3 months postoperatively, but there was a considerable redistribution of flow in the circle of Willis. This was characterized by a decrease in contribution from the contralateral hemisphere through the anterior communicating artery, reduced cerebropetal flow rates in the ophthalmic artery, and smaller contribution of the posterior collateral sources. The CO(2) reactivity on the side of surgery increased in all patients. In patients with a contralateral occlusion, CO(2) reactivity increased on both sides. The redistribution of flow was most pronounced in patients who needed intraoperative shunting and in patients with a contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion.\nAfter carotid endarterectomy, flow redistribution, as expressed by changes in blood flow velocity values, occurs in the circle of Willis. The contribution of collateral sources is diminished, and the CO(2) reactivity increases, both of which reflect improvement of the hemodynamic condition. The most improvement occurs in patients with contralateral occlusion.",

The GSM facilitated the quantitative distinction of dark (low GSM) from bright (high GSM) plaques. Stenosis was assessed with duplex scanning. Emboli were counted on TCD in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery for half an hour. The brain CT infarction patterns (pattern A: discrete subcortical and cortical; pattern B: hemodynamic, diffuse white matter lesions, basal ganglia infarctions, lacunes) and normal CT and cerebrovascular symptoms on the ipsilateral hemisphere were noted.\nEmboli were more frequent in symptomatic (median count, 3) than asymptomatic (median count, 0) hemispheres (Mann-Whitney U test, P =.031) and in hemispheres with pattern A infarction (median count, 3.5) than in hemispheres with pattern B infarction or normal CT (median count, 0; Kruskal-Wallis test, P =.047).

Costs were calculated from the health care perspective for surveillance and subsequent interventions from 30 days to 1 year postoperatively. All costs are presented in 1995 US dollars per patient. In a simulation model, we estimated the costs and amputations of duplex scan surveillance, ankle-brachial index surveillance, and clinical follow-up conditional on the indication for surgery. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost per major amputation per patient avoided during the first postoperative year.\nDuplex scan surveillance was the least expensive ($2823) and resulted in the fewest major amputations (17 per 1000 patients examined), compared with ankle-brachial index surveillance ($5411 and 77 amputations per 1000 patients) and clinical follow-up ($5072 and 77 amputations per 1000 patients). In patients treated for critical limb ischemia, duplex scan surveillance was the least expensive ($2974) and resulted in the fewest major amputations (19 per 1000 patients). Under all surveillance programs, 13 major amputations per 1000 patients treated for intermittent claudication were performed, and clinical follow-up had the lowest costs ($1577). In a sensitivity analysis that assumed that duplex scan surveillance could have avoided six major amputations per 1000 patients treated for intermittent claudication compared with the other programs, duplex scan surveillance had an incremental cost of $80,708 per major amputation per patient avoided compared with clinical follow-up.\nDuplex scan surveillance is highly effective for patients treated for critical limb ischemia, leading to a reduction of major amputations and consequently to a reduction in costs compared with other surveillance programs. In patients treated for intermittent claudication, the evidence supporting duplex scan surveillance is less firm, but if duplex scan can avoid six major amputations per 1000 patients examined, the incremental costs are justified.",

Despite hemodynamic failure, patients had improvements in pain, emotional reactions, sleep, and family relationships at the 1-year follow-up assessment.

    "abstract": "A mycotic aneurysm of the aorta and adjacent arteries is a dreadful condition, threatening life, organs, and limbs. With regard to the aortic segment involved, repair by either in situ replacement or extra-anatomic reconstruction can be quite challenging. Even when surgery has been successful, the prognosis is described as very poor because of the weakened health status of the patient who has developed this type of aneurysm. The aim of our study was to find out whether any progress could be achieved in a single center over a long time period (18 years) through use of surgical techniques and antiseptic adjuncts.\nFrom January 1983 to December 1999, a total of 2520 patients with aneurysms of the thoracic and abdominal aorta and iliac arteries underwent surgery for aortic or iliac replacement at our institution. During that period, 33 (1.31%) of these patients (mean age, 64.3 years) were treated for mycotic aneurysms of the lower descending and thoracoabdominal (n = 13), suprarenal (n = 4), and infrarenal (n = 10) aorta and iliac arteries (n = 6). Twenty (61%) of these 33 patients had histories of various septic diseases; in the other 13 (39%), the etiology remained uncertain. Preoperative signs of infection, such as leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein, were found in 79% of the patients, and fever was apparent in 48%; 76% of the patients complained of pain. At the time of surgery, eight (24%) mycotic aneurysms were already ruptured, and 20 (61%) had penetrated into the periaortic tissues, forming a contained rupture. Five (15%) aneurysms were completely intact. The predominant microorganisms found in the aneurysm sac were Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella species. Careful debridement of all infected tissue was essential. In the infrarenal aortic and iliac vascular bed, in situ reconstruction was performed only in cases of anticipated \"low-grade\" infection. Alternative revascularization with extra-anatomic procedures (axillobifemoral or femorofemoral crossover bypass graft) was carried out in eight of 16 cases. All four suprarenal and all 13 mycotic aneurysms of the thoracoabdominal aortic segment were repaired in situ. Antibiotics were administered perioperatively, and all patients were subsequently treated with long-term antibiotics.\nIn-hospital mortality was 36% (n = 12). Because of the smallness and heterogeneity of the sample, we could not demonstrate significant evidence for any influence of aneurysm location or type of reconstruction on patients' outcome. However, survival was clearly influenced by the status of rupture. During long-term follow-up (mean, 30 months; range, 1-139 months), 10 patients (48%) died-one (4.8%) probably as a consequence of the mycotic aneurysm, the others for unrelated reasons. Eleven patients (52%) are alive and well today, with no signs of persistent or recurrent infection.\nA mycotic aneurysm of the aortic iliac region remains a life-threatening condition, especially if the aneurysm has already ruptured by the time of surgery. Although the content of the aneurysm sac is considered septic, as was proved by positive cultures in 85% of our patients, in situ reconstruction is feasible and, surprisingly, was not more closely related to higher morbidity and mortality in our series than ligation and extra-anatomic reconstruction, although most of the aneurysms repaired in situ were located at the suprarenal and thoracoabdominal aorta. We assume that our operative mortality rate of 36%, which relates to a rupture rate of 85%, could be substantially lowered if the diagnosis of mycotic aneurysm were established before rupture.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a novel quantitative three-dimensional analysis of computed tomography (CT) angiograms to establish the relationship between aortic geometry and age, sex, and body surface area in healthy subjects.\nAbdominal helical CT angiograms from 77 healthy potential renal donors (33 men/44 women; mean age, 44 years; age range, 19-67 years) were selected. In each dataset, orthonormal cross-sectional area and diameter measurements were obtained at 1-mm intervals along the automatically calculated central axis of the abdominal aorta. The aorta was subdivided into six consecutive anatomic segments (supraceliac, supramesenteric, suprarenal, inter-renal, proximal infrarenal, and distal infrarenal). The interrelated effects of anatomic segment, age, sex, and body surface area on cross-sectional dimensions were analyzed with linear mixed-effects and varying-coefficient statistical models.\nWe found that significant effects of sex and of body surface area on aortic diameters were similar at all anatomic levels. The effect of age, however, was interrelated with anatomic position, and gradually decreasing slopes of significant diameter-versus-age relationships along the aorta, which ranged from 0.14 mm/y (P <.0001) proximally to 0.03 mm/y (P =.013) distally in the abdominal aorta, were shown.\nThe abdominal aorta undergoes considerable geometric changes when a patient is between 19 and 67 years of age, leading to an increase of aortic taper with time. The hemodynamic consequences of this geometric evolution for the development of aortic disease still need to be established.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess atherosclerotic plaque deposition and aortic wall responses in the abdominal aorta in relation to the development of aneurysmal and occlusive disease in the infrarenal aorta.\nMorphologic differences at five standardized locations in the infrarenal aorta in 67 pressure perfusion-fixed male cadaver aortas (aged, 41-98 years; mean, 66 years) were studied and compared with the supraceliac segment. Quantitative computer-assisted morphometry of histologic sections included measurement of plaque area, lumen area, lumen diameter, media thickness, number of medial elastic lamellae, and the area encompassed by the internal elastic lamina that best represents the artery size of each segment. The ratio of the supraceliac segment to the midabdominal segment (normally greater than 1.3) was used to define three groups: Group I (normal): ratio greater than or equal to 1.30 (n = 31); Group II (intermediate): ratio greater than or equal to 1.20 but less than 1.30 (n = 20); and Group III: ratio less than 1.20 (n = 16), which represented dilated midabdominal aortas. There was no significant difference in age among the groups.\nGroup I had minimal intimal plaque and little gross evidence of atherosclerosis. Group II had increased intimal plaque compared with Group I (P <.01) and gross evidence of atherosclerosis, which was maximally localized in the distal aorta; there was no aortic enlargement or thinning of the media underneath the plaque. Group III had more intimal plaque than Group I (P <.01) and Group II (P <.01) and was associated with localized aortic enlargement and media thinning compared with Group I (P <.05) and Group II (P <.01). Increasing intimal plaque in Group III correlated with an increase in lumen diameter (r = 0.61, P <.05), but this relationship was not significant in Group I and Group II. The aortic media in Group III had a reduced number of medial elastic lamellae, was reduced in thickness, and was more exposed to increased wall stress than the aortas in Groups I and II.\nThese results suggest that there may be different local responses to atherosclerosis in the abdominal aorta in human beings. Plaque deposition associated with localized dilation, thinning of the media, and loss of medial elastic lamellae may predispose that segment of aorta to subsequent aneurysm formation. Plaque deposits without media thinning, without loss of elastic lamellae, and without artery wall dilation may predispose the aorta, in the event of continuing plaque accumulation, to the development of lumen stenosis.",

Quantitative and qualitative duplex scan scoring systems were used to study the evolution of thrombosis in both groups at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.\nDuring the 12-month surveillance period, two (2.5%) of the 81 patients who received LMWH and seven (9%) of the 77 patients who received OAs had recurrence of venous thrombosis (not significant). In the LMWH group no cases of major bleeding were found, and four cases (5.2%) occurred in the OA group (not significant). The mortality rate was nine (11.1%) in the LMWH group and 7.8% in the OA group (not significant). The quantitative mean duplex scan score decreased in both groups during the follow-up and had statistical significance after long-term LMWH treatment on iliofemoral DVT (1, 3, 6, and 12 months), femoropopliteal DVT (1-3 months), and infrapopliteal DVT (first month). Duplex scan evaluation showed that the rate of venous recanalization significantly increased in the common femoral vein at 6 and at 12 months and during each point of follow-up in the superficial and popliteal veins in the LMWH group. Reflux was significantly less frequent in communicating veins after LMWH treatment (17.9% vs 32.2% in the OA group). The reflux rates in the superficial (22.4% in the LMWH group, 30.6% in OA group) and deep (13.4% vs 17.7%) venous system showed no significant differences between groups.\nThe unmonitored subcutaneous administration of nadroparine in fixed daily doses was more effective than oral acenocoumarol with laboratory control adjustment in achieving recanalization of leg thrombi. With nadroparine, there was less late valvular communicating vein insufficiency, and it was at least as efficacious and safe as oral anticoagulants after long-term administration. These results suggest that LMWHs may therefore represent a real therapeutic advance in the long-term management of DVT.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) expansion and is considered by some to be a relative contraindication to conventional aortic surgery. This study was undertaken to determine if COPD increases operative death, morbidity, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), and hospital LOS, after AAA repair.\nData from national administrative records supplemented with laboratory data previously obtained for a system-wide study were analyzed in a retrospective review of 1053 consecutive patients (264 with and 789 without COPD) undergoing operation for intact or ruptured AAAs in Veterans Administration Hospitals from 1997 to 1998. Bivariate comparisons and multivariate regression were used to evaluate the impact of COPD on the number of days of ventilation, ICU LOS, total hospital LOS, and death, while controlling for other known risk factors, including acute myocardial infarction, renal failure, and age.\nThe mortality rate in elective aneurysm patients did not differ (P =.99) between patients with (3.7%) or without COPD (3.7%). However, elective AAA repair was associated with longer hospital LOS (14.4 vs 12.3 days, P =.01), longer ICU LOS (6.5 vs 5.4 days, P =.01), and a higher incidence of requiring 96 hours or more ventilation (6.9% vs 3.6%, P =.02) in patients with COPD. Ruptured AAA affected 4.9% of patients and was strongly associated with COPD (P =.02); however, COPD did not result in a statistically significant increase in death (P =.25).\nAlthough COPD does not appear to increase operative death, it is associated with an increased risk of rupture. Elective repair of AAA should not be deferred in patients with COPD despite their higher LOSs and need for postoperative ventilation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous angioplasty and stenting (PAS) in comparison with traditional open surgical (OS) revascularization for the treatment of chronic mesenteric ischemia.\nOver a 3.5-year period, 28 patients (32 vessels) underwent PAS (balloon angioplasty alone, 5 [18%] of 28; angioplasty and stenting, 23 [82%] of 28) for symptoms of chronic mesenteric ischemia. These patients were compared with a previously published series of 85 patients (130 vessels) treated with OS (bypass grafting, 60 [71%] of 85; transaortic endarterectomy, 19 [22%] of 85; or patch angioplasty, 6 [7%] of 85).\nThe PAS and OS groups were similar with respect to baseline comorbidities, duration of symptoms (median: 6.7 vs 10.5 months, P =.52), and the number of vessels involved, but the patients differed in their age at presentation (median: 72 vs 65 years, P =.005). Fewer vessels were revascularized per patient in the PAS group (1.1 +/- 0.4) compared with the OS group (1.5 +/- 0.6, P =.001). Overall, 85.7% (24/28) had one vessel and 14.3% (4/28) had two vessels revascularized in the PAS group versus 48.2% (41/85) with one-vessel and 47.1% (40/85) with two-vessel revascularization in the OS group. No difference was noted in the early in-hospital complications (median: 17.9% [PAS] vs 32.9% [OS], P =.12) or mortality rate (10.7% [PAS] vs 8.2% [OS], P =.71). A reduced length of hospital stay in the PAS patients did not attain statistical significance (median: 5 days [PAS] vs 13 days [OS], P =.08). Although the 3-year cumulative recurrent stenosis (P =.62) and mortality rate (P =.99) did not differ, the PAS treatment group had a higher incidence of recurrent symptoms (P =.001).\nAlthough the results of PAS and OS were similar with respect to morbidity, death, and recurrent stenosis, PAS was associated with a significantly higher incidence of recurrent symptoms.

    "abstract": "The Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study established benefit of carotid endarterectomy for 60% to 99% asymptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. Optimal follow-up intervals to detect progression from < 60% to 60%-99% ICA stenosis are unknown. In a previous study from our laboratory, we found that ICAs with < 60% stenosis and peak systolic velocities (PSVs) of 175 cm/s or more on initial duplex were at high risk for progression. Prospective evaluation of this hypothesis and determination of optimal duplex follow-up intervals for asymptomatic patients with < 60% ICA stenosis form the basis of this report.\nAll patients who underwent initial carotid duplex examination for any indication since January 1, 1995, with at least one patent, asymptomatic, previously nonoperated ICA with < 60% stenosis; with 6 months' or greater follow-up; and with one or more repeat duplex examinations were entered into the study. On the basis of the initial duplex examination, ICAs were classified into two groups: those with a PSV less than 175 cm/s and those with a PSV of 175 cm/s or more. Follow-up duplex examinations were performed at varying intervals to detect progression from < 60% to 60%-99% ICA stenosis with criteria previously reported (both PSV > or = 260 cm/s and end-diastolic velocity > or = 70 cm/s).\nA total of 407 patients (640 asymptomatic ICAs with < 60% stenosis) underwent serial duplex scans (mean follow-up, 22 months). Three ICAs (0.5%) became symptomatic and progressed to 60%-99% ICA stenosis at a mean of 21 months (all transient ischemic attacks), whereas four other ICAs occluded without stroke during follow-up. Progression to 60%-99% stenosis without symptoms was detected in 46 ICAs (7%) (mean, 18 months). Of the 633 patent asymptomatic arteries, 548 ICAs (87%) had initial PSVs less than 175 cm/s, and 85 ICAs (13%) had initial PSVs of 175 cm/s or more. Asymptomatic progression to 60%-99% ICA stenosis occurred in 22 (26%) of 85 ICAs with initial PSVs of 175 cm/s or more, whereas 24 (4%) of 548 ICAs with initial PSVs less than 175 cm/s progressed (P <.0001). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine freedom from progression at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months, which was 95%, 83%, and 70% for ICAs with initial PSVs of 175 cm/s or more versus 100%, 99%, and 95%, respectively, for ICAs with initial PSVs less than 175 cm/s (P <.0001).\nPatients with < 60% ICA stenosis and PSVs of 175 cm/s or more on initial duplex examination are significantly more likely to progress asymptomatically to 60%-99% ICA stenosis, and progression is sufficiently frequent to warrant follow-up duplex studies at 6-month intervals. Patients with < 60% ICA stenosis and initial PSVs less than 175 cm/s may have follow-up duplex examinations safely deferred for 2 years.",

    "abstract": "Vascular malformations of the pelvis are rare and present a difficult therapeutic challenge. Surgical treatment is notoriously difficult and carries a high likelihood of recurrence. Surgical proximal ligation of a feeding vessel may in fact be contraindicated, because it can make subsequent transcatheter therapy impossible. The purpose of this study was to review our results with transcatheter embolization therapy in symptomatic complex pelvic vascular malformations in 35 patients.\nA retrospective review was conducted of a prospectively compiled database of all patients undergoing transcatheter therapy of a pelvic vascular malformation at our institution.\nThe mean age of the patients was 34 years (range, 16 months-66 years), and 51% were male. The most common presenting symptoms included pain (59%), a visible or palpable lesion (62%), associated palpable pulsation or thrill (44%), hemorrhage (27%), congestive heart failure (18%), and symptoms due to mass effect (35%). A significant number of patients had undergone previous, unsuccessful attempted surgical treatment of the lesion (32%). The most common type of lesion noted on arteriography was arteriovenous shunting (89%). Patients required a mean of 2.4 embolization procedures (range, 1-11 procedures) over a mean period of 23.3 months (range, 1-144 months). The most common agents used were rapidly polymerizing acrylic adhesives. The most common vessels involved and treated were branches of the hypogastric artery (82%). More than one procedure were performed in 20 patients (53%). Seven were planned as staged embolizations, whereas 13 were due to residual or recurrent symptoms. Adjunctive surgical procedures were performed subsequent to embolization therapy in five patients (15%). Eighty-three percent of patients were asymptomatic or significantly improved at a mean follow-up of 84 months (range, 1-204 months).\nPelvic vascular malformations are difficult to eradicate completely, and recurrences are common. Many patients require multiple therapeutic interventions. However, most of these difficult cases have good results in the long term. Transcatheter embolization plays a significant role in, and may be the treatment of choice for, symptomatic pelvic vascular malformations.",

    "abstract": "A growing number of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms are currently being offered endoluminal treatment. However, the incidence of endoleaks, stenosis, and thrombosis is around 25% to 30%. As a result, a strict post procedure imaging surveillance protocol is necessary. The purpose of this study was to compare duplex ultrasonography (DU) and computed tomography (CT) for the follow-up of endoluminally treated aortic aneurysms.\nA total of 89 patients were followed up with serial CT and DU at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after endoluminal treatment. Special attention was directed toward the presence of endoleaks and aneurysm diameter evolution. Preoperative CT and DU were also reviewed to assess aneurysm diameter correlation.\nWith DU, 14 type I and 21 type II endoleaks were identified. In one case the DU did not visualize a type II endoleak present on CT, and CT did not confirm three type II leaks identified with DU. There was only one false positive for type I endoleak with DU. The sensitivity of DU was 96% with a specificity of 94%, when compared with CT. A linear regression analysis of the diameters obtained with DU and CT revealed a good correlation. However, variability was high, indicating poor agreement. Regarding diameter evolution, the range was identical in 45%, and the trend was similar in 73%. However, in 9% of the cases, DU showed a decrease in diameter, whereas CT showed a significant increase.\nDU is an accurate tool for the diagnosis of endoleaks, but is less valuable for diameter measurements, when compared with CT. Currently, DU is a useful tool, but CT remains a key part of the postoperative evaluation after endoluminal treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. At institutions where DU is used for follow-up, researchers should perform quality control studies to avoid potentially significant errors.",

In one case the DU did not visualize a type II endoleak present on CT, and CT did not confirm three type II leaks identified with DU. There was only one false positive for type I endoleak with DU. The sensitivity of DU was 96% with a specificity of 94%, when compared with CT. A linear regression analysis of the diameters obtained with DU and CT revealed a good correlation. However, variability was high, indicating poor agreement. Regarding diameter evolution, the range was identical in 45%, and the trend was similar in 73%. However, in 9% of the cases, DU showed a decrease in diameter, whereas CT showed a significant increase.",

    "abstract": "The goal of endovascular grafting of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is to exclude the aneurysm sac from systemic pressure and thereby decrease the risk of rupture. Unlike conventional open surgery, branch vessels in the sac (eg, lumbar artery and inferior mesenteric artery [IMA]) are not ligated and can potentially transmit pressure. The purpose of our investigation was to evaluate the feasibility of various interventional techniques for measuring pressure within the aneurysm sac in patients who had undergone endovascular repair of AAAs.\nSac pressure measurements were performed in 21 patients who had undergone stent graft repair of AAAs. Seventeen of 21 patients had endoleaks demonstrated on 30-day computed tomographic (CT) scans. Access to the aneurysm sac in these patients was through direct translumbar sac puncture (5 patients), through a patent IMA accessed via the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) (9 patients), or by direct cannulation around attachment sites (3 patients). Four patients had perioperative pressure measurements obtained through catheters positioned along side of the endovascular graft at the time of its deployment. Two of these catheters were left in position for 30 hours during which time CT and conventional angiography were performed. Pressures were determined with standard arterial-line pressure transduction techniques and compared with systemic pressure in each patient.\nElevated sac pressure was found in all patients. The sac pressure in patients with endoleaks was found to be systemic (15 patients) or near systemic (2 patients) and all had pulsatile waveforms. Elevated sac pressures were also found in patients without CT or angiographic evidence of endoleak (2 patients). Injection of the sacs in two of these patients revealed a patent lumbar artery and an IMA.\nIt is possible to measure pressures from within the aneurysm sac in patients with stent grafts with a variety of techniques. Patients may continue to have pressurized AAA sacs despite endovascular AAA repair. Endoleaks transmit pulsatile pressure into the aneurysm sac regardless of the type. It is possible to have systemic sac pressures without evidence of endoleaks on CT or angiography.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the prognostic value of hemodynamic parameters measured with duplex ultrasound scan, together with other important graft and patient characteristics, in predicting lower extremity vein graft thrombosis.\nA total of 165 lower extremity vein grafts were entered prospectively into a postoperative duplex ultrasound scan surveillance program with examinations performed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months, and annually thereafter. Duplex scan-derived blood flow velocity measurements were recorded at 1562 patient visits over 7 years. Graft patency was determined after each visit, and an analysis of factors predictive of vein graft thrombosis was performed with Poisson regression.\nThirty-two episodes of first-time graft thrombosis occurred, 23 of which were permanent. One-, 3-, and 5-year secondary graft patency rates were 90%, 86%, and 79%, respectively. In multivariate analyses, duplex scan velocity measurements predictive of lower extremity graft thrombosis included the maximum velocity ratio (Vr) in association with a graft stenosis and the mean graft peak systolic velocity (MGV) within nonstenotic portions of the body of the graft. The incidence of graft thrombosis among grafts without inflow/outflow stenoses, with Vr less than 3.5, and with MGV 50 cm/s or more, was 2.9% per year. Incidence rates were considerably higher among grafts with a of Vr of 3.5 or more (incidence rate ratio = 7.0; 95% CI, 3.4-14.6) or an MGV less than 50 cm/s (incidence rate ratio = 6.5; 95% CI, 3.3-13.1). In grafts without identifiable inflow, outflow, or graft stenoses, there was no association between MGV and the risk of graft thrombosis.\nDuplex scan velocity measurements are valid predictors of impending graft thrombosis. A Vr of 3.5 or more and an MGV less than 50 cm/s are the best predictive measures. Repair of correctable graft lesions with a Vr of 3.5 or more, or inflow, outflow, or graft lesions associated with an MGV less than 50 cm/s are recommended. Grafts without detectable inflow, outflow, or graft stenoses, regardless of MGV, may be safely followed.",

Preoperative variables were assessed for their influence on outcome with chi(2) and outcome with life-table analysis with Cox proportionate hazard testing.\nFree tissue transfer was performed synchronously with arterial reconstruction with autologous vein in 49 patients and after a previous functioning venous bypass graft in 16 patients. The 30-day mortality rate was 5%, and major complications occurred in another 16% of patients.

The combination of diabetes and chronic renal insufficiency, particularly the need for dialysis, is a powerful predictor of failure and should be considered a strong contraindication for this procedure.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the initial and mid-term results of the Zenith endovascular grafting system for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms.\nProspective databases at seven centers were used to assess a cohort of patients that underwent treatment for aortic, aortoiliac, or iliac aneurysms since 1995. Data were analyzed to yield descriptive characteristics that pertained to the patients, the aortic morphologic features, the graft configuration, and the complications. Follow-up imaging data were used to determine size changes of the aneurysm sac, endoleak rates, and further complications. Finally survival data were expressed with a Kaplan-Meier analysis.\nA total of 528 patients were treated with the Zenith endograft. Most of the patients (66%) were considered to be at a high physiologic risk for open repair. Successful graft implantation was accomplished in all but four patients. An overall endoleak rate of 15% was noted, of which 4% was treated urgently because they were thought to represent attachment site faults. The mean follow-up period was 18 months. A total of eight endograft migrations were detected after 2 years of follow-up with an early version of the system. There were three late conversions; two ruptures occurred during the follow-up period.\nThis early and mid-term data support the use of the Zenith endovascular graft for the treatment of aortic and aortoiliac aneurysms in properly selected patients. The risks of significant complications or aneurysm rupture are low.",

This is a preliminary report of the technical results and 30-day clinical outcome of these trials.\nMulticenter prospective trials were conducted to test the Talent stent-graft in high-risk and low-risk patient populations with AAA, including phase I feasibility and phase II clinical trials. The low-risk study included concurrent surgical controls.\nIn the phase I trial, deployment success was achieved in 92% (23/25 patients), and initial technical success was 78% (18/23 implants without endoleak). The 30-day technical success rate was 96%, with six endoleaks that resolved spontaneously (without need for further intervention); and the 30-day mortality rate was 12% (3/25 patients). The phase II high-risk trial demonstrated a deployment success of 94% (119/127 patients) and an initial technical success of 86% (102/119 implants). The 30-day technical success rate was 96%, and the 30-day mortality rate was 1.5% (2/127 patients). The phase II low-risk trial included a first-generation and a second-generation Talent stent-graft. Deployment success rates were 97% and 99%, respectively, and technical success rates at 30 days were 97% and 96%, respectively. The 30-day mortality rate was 2% in the phase II low-risk first-generation device trial, and the adverse-event rate was 20%. Corresponding figures for the second-generation device were 0% and 1.8%, respectively.\nThe Talent stent-graft can be deployed successfully and achieves endovascular exclusion in a large proportion of patients with AAA. Morbidity and mortality rates are acceptable. One-year clinical results and the comparison with concurrent surgical control subjects remain to be evaluated.",

    "abstract": "The objective was to review the current results of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with the AneuRx stent graft and to determine the effectiveness of the device in achieving the primary objective of preventing aneurysm rupture.\nThe outcome of all patients treated during the past 4 years in the U.S. AneuRx clinical trial was determined, and the worldwide clinical experience was reviewed.\nA total of 1192 patients were treated with the AneuRx stent graft during all phases of the U.S. Clinical Trial from June 1996 to November 1999, with follow-up extending to June 2000. Ten (0.8%) patients have had aneurysm rupture, with most ruptures (n = 6) occurring in 174 (3.4%) patients treated with an early stiff bifurcation stent graft design used in phase I and in the initial stages of phase II. Since the current, flexible, segmented bifurcation stent graft design was introduced, four (0.4%) ruptures have occurred among 1018 patients treated. Of these, one was during implantation, two were placed too far below the renal arteries, and one patient refused treatment of a type I endoleak. Kaplan-Meier analysis of all 1192 patients treated with the AneuRx stent graft including both stent graft designs revealed the patient survival rate to be 93% at 1 year, 88% at 2 years, and 86% at 3 years, freedom from conversion to open repair to be 98% at 1 year, 97% at 2 years, and 93% at 3 years, and freedom from secondary procedure to be 94% at 1 year, 92% at 2 years, and 88% at 3 years. Freedom from aneurysm rupture with the commercially available segmented bifurcation stent graft was 99.7% at 1 year, 99.5% at 2 years, and 99.5% at 3 years. The presence or absence of endoleak on contrast computed tomography scanning after stent graft placement was not found to be a significant predictor of long-term outcome measures. Worldwide experience with the AneuRx device now approaches 10,000 patients.\nEndovascular management of abdominal aortic aneurysms with the AneuRx stent graft has markedly reduced the risk of aneurysm rupture while eliminating the need for open aneurysm surgery in 98% of patients at 1 year and 93% of patients at 3 years. The device was effective in preventing aneurysm rupture in 99.5% of patients over a 3-year period. The overall patient survival rate was 93% at 1 year and 86% at 3 years.",

    "abstract": "The Ancure endografting system (Guidant Cardiac and Vascular Division, Menlo Park, Calif) features a unibody, nonsupported woven polyester graft designed to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms. It is constructed in tube, bifurcated, and aortoiliac configurations. The attachment system consists of a frame with four independent V-shaped double hooks that penetrate the arterial wall for fixation. There are separate attachment systems at the proximal and distal ends of the endoprosthesis. In September 1999, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the tube and bifurcated devices for general use. The aortoiliac device is under present consideration of the FDA. Phase II and III clinical trials of the system enrolled over 870 patients from the end of 1995 to the summer of 1999. The device was deployed successfully in 90% to 96% of cases, depending on the configuration and the phase of the trial. Mortality rates were similar to those of concurrent open surgical control rates, but serious morbidity was reduced. Long-term follow-up of the bifurcated group from phase II showed only one migration and no ruptures. Aneurysm size reduction in this group was noted in 51.3% of patients at 1 year and 68.5% at 2 years. In the same subset, type I endoleaks were noted in 2.7% at 1 year and 1.3% at 2 years. All postoperative imaging studies were reviewed by a core laboratory facility. The advantages of the ancure system include solid fixation, flexibility in accommodating morphologic changes, and excellent long-term clinical performance. The disadvantages include a large introducer system and the potential for limb obstruction by compression or angulation. However, limb compromise responds well to intraluminal stenting. The expected FDA approval of the aortoiliac device and a larger variety of graft sizes should expand the number of patients who can be treated with this system.",

    "abstract": "Carotid angioplasty-stenting (CAS) is a relatively new endovascular procedure that has been used increasingly in recent years. Its popularity is due to, at least in part, the perceived advantages of a less invasive treatment for extracranial carotid occlusive disease. However, valid data that contrast the efficacy of CAS and carotid endarterectomy (CEA), the gold standard for the treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis, are not available. The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stent Trial (CREST) will contrast the relative efficacy of CAS with CEA in the prevention of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death during a 30-day periprocedural period or an ipsilateral stroke thereafter during a follow-up period extending up to 4 years. Stroke events will be verified by an adjudication committee masked to the assigned treatment. Secondary outcomes will (1) describe differential efficacy of CAS and CEA in men and women, (2) contrast periprocedural (30-day) morbidity and postprocedural (after 30-days) morbidity and mortality rates, (3) estimate and contrast the restenosis rates of the two procedures, (4) evaluate the differences in measures of health-related quality of life and cost effectiveness, and (5) identify subgroups of participants at differential risk for CAS and CEA. The primary eligibility criterion is a >50% stenosis of the carotid artery in patients with ipsilateral amaurosis fugax (transient monocular blindness), transient ischemic attack, or nondisabling stroke. Men and women will be eligible for the trial, but patients with medical conditions likely to limit their participation during the follow-up or to interfere with outcome evaluation will be excluded. After a credentialing and training phase, 2500 patients will be randomized to the treatments. Statistical analysis of the primary outcome will use standard survival methods.",

    "abstract": "Carotid bifurcation angioplasty and stenting (CBAS) has generated controversy and widely divergent opinions about its current therapeutic role. To resolve differences and establish a unified view of CBAS' present role, a consensus conference of 17 experts, world opinion leaders from five countries, was held on November 21, 1999.\nThese 17 participants had previously answered 18 key questions on current CBAS issues. At the conference these 18 questions and participants' answers were discussed and in some cases modified to determine points of agreement (consensus), near consensus, (prevailing opinion), or divided opinion (disagreement).\nConference discussion added two modified questions, placing a total of 20 key questions before the participants, representing four specialties (interventional radiology, seven; vascular surgery, six; interventional cardiology, three; neurosurgery, one). It is interesting that consensus was reached on the answers to 11 (55%) of 20 of the questions, and near consensus was reached on answers to 6 (30%) of 20 of the questions. Only with the answers to three (15%) of the questions was there persisting controversy. Moreover, both these differences and areas of agreement crossed specialty lines. Consensus Conclusions: CBAS should not currently undergo widespread practice, which should await results of randomized trials. CBAS is currently appropriate treatment for patients at high risk in experienced centers. CBAS is not generally appropriate for patients at low risk. Neurorescue skills should be available if CBAS is performed. When cerebral protection devices are available, they should be used for CBAS. Adequate stents and technology for performing CBAS currently exist. There were divergent opinions regarding the proportions of patients presently acceptable for CBAS treatment (<5% to 100%, mean 44%) and best treated by CBAS (<3% to 100%, mean 34%). These and other consensus conclusions will help physicians in all specialties deal with CBAS in a rational way rather than by being guided by unsubstantiated claims.",

    "abstract": "The endovascular technique has revolutionized the treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). At our institution, we examined the impact of an endovascular program on the traditional operative training of the vascular fellows in the treatment of infrarenal AAA.\nWe examined the records of our vascular fellows' experience from July 1995 to May 2000. We introduced the endovascular treatment for infrarenal AAA in 1995.\nThe fellows have performed increasing numbers of endovascular cases each year, with a predicted number of 124 cases for 1999-2000. However, despite an increase in the overall volume of patients with infrarenal AAA (102 cases in 1998-1999 and a predicted 160 cases in 1999-2000), the trainees will experience a reduction in the number of open AAAs from 61 cases in 1998-1999 to a predicted 36 cases in 1999-2000. However, the volume of open suprarenal AAA has also increased from eight cases in 1998 to 1999 to a predicted 24 cases in 1999-2000. With no significant change in the open aortoiliac occlusive cases from previous years, the current fellows will graduate with a similar volume of open aortic procedures as their predecessors.\nWith the recent advances in endovascular technology, our traditional operative approach to the treatment of AAA disease may be lacking in the training of future vascular surgeons. At our institution, although fewer open infrarenal AAA cases were performed, the trainees have maintained the open aortic experience by performing an increased volume of suprarenal AAAs. We have to critically reevaluate and redefine what constitutes adequate vascular fellow experience in the surgical treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms.",

We evaluated the long-term outcomes of patients treated with this algorithm.\nBetween 1994 and 2000, 23 patients were evaluated with effort thrombosis of the subclavian vein. Thrombolysis was instituted on an average of 9.4 days (range, 1-30 days) after initial onset of symptoms. Average time to clot lysis was 34 hours (range, 12-72 hours). After immediate supraclavicular thoracic inlet decompression, all patients underwent PTA. Fourteen patients with residual vein stenosis (>50%) after PTA underwent stenting of the subclavian vein. Complications in this series included three wound hematomas that required drainage in two patients and one subpleural hematoma that required thoracotomy for decompression.\nAll patients who underwent PTA are patent, with a mean follow-up of 4 years (range, 2-6 years). In the veins treated with stents, 9 of 14 veins are patent, with a mean follow-up of 3.5 years (range, 1-6 years). Two veins had early occlusions (2 days); two veins occluded at 1 year; and seven veins occluded at 3 years. Three of the patients (including those patients who experienced the early failed procedures) were later identified with factor V Leiden. Early failures also had clot extending into the brachial vein.\nPatients with short-segment venous strictures after successful lysis and thoracic outlet decompression may safely be treated with subclavian venous stents and can expect long-term patency.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the selection of patients for combined femorofemoral bypass (FFB) grafting and iliac balloon angioplasty (IBA) and stenting for bilateral iliac occlusive disease (successively or simultaneously) and the correlation of the length and location of stenoses of the donor iliac artery to the success of FFB grafts.\nForty-one patients with long iliac occlusion and significant contralateral iliac stenosis were treated with combined FFB grafting and IBA and stenting, which were performed simultaneously or percutaneously within 1 to 2 days before surgery. Stenting was performed for suboptimal IBAs. IBA/graft patency was evaluated by duplex scanning/ankle-brachial index at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and every 12 months thereafter. A life-table analysis of patency was performed, according to the length of stenosis as classified by the Society of Cardiovascular Interventional Radiology (group A, < 3 cm and 3-5 cm; group B, > 5 cm).\nIndications for surgery were limb salvage (22%), rest pain (44%), and claudication (34%). The mean follow-up time was 34.1 months. Perioperative complications were 7% for group A versus 62% for group B (P = .0007) with no perioperative deaths or amputations. Stenting was needed in 12 of 13 patients (92%) in group B versus four of 28 patients (14%) in group A (P < .0001) and in 11 of 12 external iliac artery lesions versus five of 29 common iliac artery lesions (P < .0001). The overall early success rate was 100% for group A and 62% for group B (P = .0028). The primary patency rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 96%, 85%, and 85% for group A, respectively, and for group B were 46%, 46%, and 31%, respectively (P < .01). The secondary patency rates for group A at 1, 2, and 3 years were 100%, 96%, and 87%, respectively; and for group B were 62%, 54%, and 27%, respectively (P < .001). The overall primary and secondary patency rates for common iliac and external iliac artery lesions were similar (72% and 72% versus 67% and 75%, respectively). The overall limb salvage rates were 96% for group A and 85% for group B. Seven of 13 patients (54%) of group B, in contrast with 0 of 28 patients in group A, had to undergo a revision of the procedure within 30 days (P < .01).\nCombined use of IBA and stenting and FFB grafting is effective and durable and can be performed simultaneously, if the donor iliac stenosis length is 5 cm or less. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/stenting of stenoses of 5 cm or more fail to support FFB grafting in most patients; therefore, their combination should be questioned.",

    "abstract": "Thromboembolic events are more frequent in women with established cardiovascular disease taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The effect of HRT on the outcome of women with aortoiliac occlusive disease is unknown. The purpose of this study was to estimate the influence of risk factors, including HRT, on the outcome of women undergoing iliac artery angioplasty and stent placement.\nDuring a 5-year period (between 1994 and 1999), 126 iliac angioplasties with stent placement (144 stents) were performed in 88 women. The criteria prepared by the Ad Hoc Committee on Reporting Standards (Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery) were followed to define the variables. Both univariate (Kaplan-Meier) and multivariate analyses (Cox proportional hazards model) were used to determine the association among preoperative variables, cumulative patency, limb salvage, and survival.\nThe patients' average age was 63.2 years with 43% of the patients taking HRT. Indications for iliac angioplasty with stenting were disabling claudication (65%), limb salvage (32%), and blue toe syndrome (3%). The technical success rate was 95% (120 of 126 procedures). Primary stenting was performed in 28 patients (22%). Stents were placed selectively after iliac angioplasty for residual stenosis or pressure gradient (57%), iliac dissection (8%), long-segment occlusions (8%), or eccentric lesions (5%). There were no significant differences between HRT users and nonusers with regard to risk factors, except there was a higher frequency of diabetes in women taking HRT. Overall, the primary patency rate was 76% at 1 year, 67% at 3 years, and 62% at 5 years. Primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 75%, 57%, and 49% for users of HRT and 77%, 74%, and 74%, respectively, for nonusers. Limb salvage rates were not statistically different between users and nonusers of HRT at 5 years (95% vs 96%). Univariate and Cox regression analyses identified HRT use (Kaplan-Meier, log-rank test, P = .02; relative risk, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.5; P = .006) and stent placement in the external iliac artery (relative risk, 4.3; 95% CI, 2.3-7.9; P < .001) as independent predictors of decreased primary patency.\nWomen undergoing iliac angioplasty with stent placement who are taking HRT have significantly reduced primary patency rates. Despite initial technical success, HRT users are at increased risk of long-term failure and might require subsequent procedures to obtain clinical success. External iliac angioplasty and stenting are also associated with decreased primary stent patency in women.",

    "abstract": "As a minimally invasive strategy for the treatment of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), endovascular repair has been embraced with enthusiasm because of the promise of achieving a durable result with a reduced risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Our mid-term experience with endovascular AAA repair was assessed by examining early and late clinical outcome in concurrent cohorts of patients stratified either as low-risk or as at increased-risk for intervention.\nFrom April 1994 to December 1999, endovascular AAA repair was performed in 104 patients with commercially available systems. A subset of patients considered at increased risk for intervention (n = 51) were categorized as such based on a pre-existing history of ischemic coronary artery disease (73%), with documentation of myocardial infarction (57%) or congestive heart failure (29%), or because of the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, or malignancy.\nThe perioperative mortality rate (30-day) was 7.8% for patients at increased risk compared with 1.9% among those classified as low-risk (P = NS). There was no difference between groups in age (72 +/- 7 years vs 74 +/- 7 years; mean +/- SD), surgical time (221 +/- 90 minutes vs 192 +/- 68 minutes), blood loss (437 +/- 402 mL vs 331 +/- 238 mL), postoperative hospital stay (4.4 +/- 2.7 days vs 4.2 +/- 2.5 days), or days in the intensive care unit (1.2 +/- 1.6 days vs 0.6 +/- 1.3 days). Patients at increased risk of intervention had larger aneurysms than patients at low risk (58 +/- 11 mm vs 52 +/- 12 mm; P < .05). Stent grafts were successfully implanted in 47 (92%) patients at increased risk versus 50 (94%) patients at low risk (P = NS). Conversion rates to open operative repair were similar in increased-risk and low-risk groups at 3.9% and 5.7%, respectively. The initial endoleak rate was 21% versus 18% based on the first computed tomography performed (either at discharge or 1 month; P = NS). To date, patients at increased risk have been monitored for 14.6 +/- 12.4 months, and patients at low risk have been monitored for 17.7 +/- 15.0 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis for cumulative patient survival demonstrated a reduced probability of survival among those patients initially classified as at increased risk for intervention (P < .05, Mantel-Cox test). Both cohorts had similar 2-year clinical success rates of approximately 75%.\nDespite the use of an endovascular approach for aneurysm treatment, the risk of perioperative death and morbidity remains present for all patients including those who have no significant medical comorbidity. Moreover, although clinical success rates are comparable in both patient groups, 2 years after endovascular repair was performed, at least one in four patients was classified as a clinical failure. Given the continued uncertainty associated with clinical outcome and the need for close life-long surveillance, caution is dictated in advocating endovascular treatment for the patient who is otherwise considered an ideal candidate for standard open surgical repair.",

In the first postoperative year, there were four unrelated deaths and six conversions, leaving 27 patients with complete 24-month data and 13 with complete 36-month data.\nComputed tomography angiograms were processed on a work station to measure the neck perpendicular to the central lumen line of the aorta.

This increase in neck size was continuous and linear, with a yearly rate of approximately 10% surface area; translated into diameter, this approximates 1 mm/y.\nA continuous aortic enlargement of approximately 1 mm/y at the level of the proximal endovascular anastomosis was found.

This study reports a multicenter EAG repair versus COS repair parallel cohort trial at 12 months and additional observations of specific device failure types and their impact on an aortic endograft design beyond that follow-up period.\nFrom August 1997 to September 1998, 240 patients who were treated with bifurcation EAG repairs and 28 patients who were treated with straight EAG repairs were compared with 98 patients who were treated with COS repair for elective infrarenal aortic aneurysm repair. Allocation to treatment was based on aneurysm anatomy. All cohorts underwent infrarenal procedures. Data from concurrent, nonrandomized patient accrual from 17 United States institutions were prospectively gathered and independently adjudicated for safety and efficacy. An independent core laboratory evaluated all imaging data.\nThere were 308 men and 58 women (mean age, 72 years; range, 42-94 years) treated for infrarenal aortic aneurysm (mean diameter, 55 mm; range, 40-115 mm). Mean preoperative aneurysm diameters were clinically similar (EAG repair, 54 mm vs COS repair, 57 mm). The two cohorts were not significantly different in terms of gender (P = .30) or age (P = .32). EAG repair technical success (aneurysm exclusion, graft patency, patient survival) at 30 days was 89.2%. Five patients required immediate conversion to COS repair, four caused by access complications and one caused by operator-induced EAG repair malposition. The 30-day mortality rate was 1.5% for EAG repair and 3.1% for COS repair (P = .59). The 12-month survival rate was 94.3% for EAG repair and 95.9% for COS repair. The intermediate-term cumulative survival rate at 24 months was 84.9% for EAG repair and 80.3% for COS repair (P = .48). EAG repair device failure occurred from fabric erosion in six patients, with two deaths from ruptured aneurysm at 18 and 28 months after endografting and four device failures resolved by secondary procedures. Five endograft limb dislocations were all resolved by secondary endovascular procedures. Major or minor endograft migration required secondary procedures in five patients, including conversion in two patients.\nThe clinical outcome at 12 months demonstrated effective aneurysm treatment and comparable safety between EAG repair and COS repair by conventional endpoints. Ongoing follow-up beyond 12 months revealed device-related adverse events that required endograft design changes. Diligent surveillance of outcomes beyond 12 months is necessary to adequately evaluate EAG repair devices.",

    "abstract": "Endograft technology for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is being applied more liberally. There is little information about the midterm performance of these grafts. This study is focused on follow-up interventions after endograft repair for AAA.\nProspective follow-up analysis of a consecutive patient series (n = 173 patients) at a single center who underwent endovascular AAA repair up to 50 months after operation. Seventeen percent of the patients were regarded unfit for open surgery. Four types of commercially available grafts were used. The Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery guidelines were applied for endograft implantation and data preparation.\nIn two patients, the procedure was converted to open surgery. In one procedure, emergency repair for iliac artery rupture was performed. The 30-day mortality rate was 2.8% (n = 5 patients). An early second procedure to correct type I endoleaks was necessary in 8 cases (4.6%; 3-10 days). The following midterm results were obtained: median follow-up of the 166 remaining patients was 18 months (range, 1-50 months); 50 additional procedures were necessary in 37 patients (22.3%) for the treatment of leaks (n = 45 interventions) or to maintain graft patency (n = 5 grafts; four patients with concomitant graft segment disconnection); and 46% of the reinterventions were performed within the first year of follow-up and 74% of the reinterventions were performed within the second year of follow-up. One patient died after emergency surgery for rupture as the result of a secondary endoleak at 1 year. Although seven interventions (14%) were performed for type II endoleak, no serious complications were related to patent sidebranches. There was no statistically significant difference between the need for maintenance in different graft configurations (tubular, bifurcated, aorto-uniiliac), or number of graft segments (1, 2, 3-4, > or = 5 segments). New generation grafts (after 1996) performed better than early generation grafts (P = 0.04, chi-squared test) with regard to endoleak development.\nEndograft repair for AAA is safe but, with current technology, not as durable as open repair. Our data suggest that the use of endograft repair for AAA is becoming safer as endograft design improves. Nevertheless in 26.6% of the patients, there is need for reintervention within midterm follow-up. Close follow-up is crucial because late leaks may develop after more than 2 years after the initial procedure. Endoluminal repair should therefore be applied with caution, strict indication, and only if a tight follow-up is warranted. These findings may also affect health care reimbursement policies.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent and frequency of dilatation of the proximal aortic neck over time after endovascular exclusion of abdominal aortic aneurysms and the effect on the continued integrity of the repair.\nPatients enrolled in the multicenter tube and bifurcated trials of the Guidant-Endovascular Technologies Ancure endografting system and at least 1 year of follow-up were reviewed. Neck diameter measurements were obtained from computed tomography scans that were obtained with and without contrast by an independent core laboratory facility. The diameter was considered to be the minor axis of the first slice at which point at least one half of the proximal attachment frame was located. A change exceeding 2.5 mm was considered to be significant.\nAt 1 year, 13% of the patients (42/314 patients) showed evidence of proximal neck dilatation, with a mean diameter increase of 4.8 +/- 2.4 mm. The proportion of patients with dilatation increased to 21% at 2 years (48/226 patients) and 19% at 3 years (11/59 patients). The initial presence of an endoleak, the neck length, and the aneurysm size had no clear effect on the development of neck enlargement. Initial neck diameter was inversely related to and the strongest predictor of later dilatation. Graft oversizing was not an independent predictor of neck dilatation on multivariate analysis. Only one migration of the proximal attachment system was observed during follow-up.\nMost proximal aortic necks remain stable, but approximately 20% of necks increase in diameter by 2 years. Smaller necks dilate more often than larger ones. This effect is independent from the frequent oversizing of grafts in smaller necks.

    "abstract": "Most endografts for an endoluminal AAA repair cannot achieve an adequate hemostatic seal in ectatic common iliac arteries larger than 14 mm. The extension of the endograft into the external iliac artery can alleviate this problem but requires sacrifice of the internal iliac artery. We have used the larger diameter aortic extension cuff to obtain adequate endograft to arterial wall apposition in patients with ectatic, nonaneurysmal common iliac arteries. Because of the resultant flared configuration of the iliac limb, the technique is termed bell-bottom. However, it is unknown whether subsequent enlargement of these ectatic common iliac arteries that will lead to endoleaks or endograft migration will occur.\nThe records of all 96 patients who have undergone endoluminal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair at our institution were reviewed. Fourteen patients were identified in whom aortic extension cuffs were placed into 18 ectatic (>14 mm, but <20 mm) common iliac arteries. The mean follow-up time was 14 months (range, 6-24 months). The maximal diameter of the common iliac artery on computed tomography scan before endograft placement was compared with the maximal diameter at the most recent follow-up. The incidence of endoleaks, ruptures, and endograft migration related to the \"bell-bottom\" technique were recorded.\nThe mean preoperative common iliac artery diameter was 18 mm (range, 15-20 mm). Aortic extension cuffs of 20-mm diameter and 24-mm diameter were used in 14 and 4 common iliac arteries, respectively. The diameter did not change in 11 common iliac arteries (61%), increased by 1 mm in 4 common iliac arteries (22%), and decreased by 1 mm in 3 common iliac arteries (17%). No endoleaks, ruptures, or endograft migration related to this technique was identified.\nThe use of aortic extension cuffs for ectatic common iliac arteries expands the number of patients who can be treated endoluminally without sacrifice of the internal iliac artery. Most common iliac arteries do not increase in diameter. When enlargement occurs, the degree of dilation is minimal. Therefore, the \"bell-bottom\" technique appears to be an acceptable option in the management of large, nonaneurysmal iliac vessels during endoluminal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.",

    "abstract": "Hypogastric artery (HA) occlusion during aortic aneurysm repair has been associated with considerable morbidity. We analyzed the consequences of interrupting one or both HAs in the standard surgical or endovascular treatment of aortoiliac aneurysms (AIAs).\nFrom 1992 to 2000, 154 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (n = 66), iliac aneurysms (n = 28), or AIAs (n = 60) required interruption of one (n = 134) or both (n = 20) HAs as part of their endovascular (n = 107) or open repair (n = 47). Endovascular treatment was performed with a variety of industry- or surgeon-made grafts in combination with coil embolization of the HAs. The standard surgical techniques included oversewing or excluding the origins of the HAs and extending the prosthetic graft to the external iliac or femoral artery.\nThere were no cases of buttock necrosis, ischemic colitis requiring laparotomy, or death when one or both HAs were interrupted. Persistent buttock claudication occurred after 16 (12%) of the unilateral and 2 (11%) of the bilateral HA interruptions. Impotence occurred in 7 (9%) of the unilateral and 2 (13%) of the bilateral HA interruptions. Minor neurologic deficits of the lower extremity were observed in 2 (1.5%) of the patients with unilateral HA interruption.\nAlthough HA flow should be preserved if possible, selective interruption of one or both HAs can usually be accomplished safely during endovascular and open repair of anatomically challenging AIAs. We believe other comorbid factors such as shock, distal embolization, or the failure to preserve collateral branches from the external iliac and femoral arteries may have contributed to the morbidity in other reports of HA interruption.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of consecutive patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) treated concurrently by means of open repair (OR) and endoluminal repair (ER) with second-generation prostheses by the same surgeons during a defined interval.\nBetween May 1995 and December 1998 second-generation (low profile, fully supported, modular) endoprostheses were implanted in 148 patients. These patients, together with 135 patients treated concurrently with OR during the same period, comprised the study group of 283 patients. Patient selection was based on aneurysm morphology. Those patients who were anatomically suitable for ER were treated with this method. The ER and OR groups were similar with regard to age, sex, and size of AAA. The ER group contained high-risk patients considered unfit for OR (n = 46), and the OR group contained high-risk patients who were anatomically unsuitable for ER (n = 19). Outcome criteria in both groups were survival and successful aneurysm repair. Success in the ER group was defined as exclusion of the aneurysm sac and stability or reduction in AAA maximum transverse diameter. Persistent endoleaks were classified as failures, regardless of whether they were subsequently corrected with secondary endovascular intervention. Data were analyzed with the life table method. The minimum period of follow-up for all patients was 18 months.\nThe perioperative mortality rate was 5.9% in the OR group and 2.7% in the ER group (not significant). There was a statistically significant difference between the survival curves of the two groups in favor of the ER group when analyzed with the log-rank test (P =.004). The Kaplan-Meier curve for graft failure for the ER group revealed a 3-year graft success probability of 82%. Survival probability with successful repair in the OR group at 3 years was 85%.\nA concurrent comparison of ER with second-generation prostheses versus OR demonstrated a significant difference in survival in favor of the ER group. The probability of survival with successful repair at 3 years was similar in both groups.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to present the results of the multicenter EVT/Guidant aorto-uni-iliac trial and to compare them with the tube, bifurcated graft, and open control series in regard to patient demographics, medical comorbidity, 30-day morbidity/mortality, and outcome at 1 year.\nOne hundred twenty-one patients not eligible for tube or bifurcated endografts were entered into the aorto-uni-iliac trial (A-I). These were compared with 153 patients in a tube (T) group, 268 patients in a bifurcated endograft (BI) group, and 111 patients in an open control (C) group. All data were audited and independently analyzed for presentation to the Food and Drug Administration.\nGroup demographics were similar with the following exceptions. Aneurysm diameter was significantly less in the T group (51.2 mm) but similar for the A-I (57 mm), BI (54.6 mm), and C (55.6 mm) groups (P < .001). There were more male patients in all endograft groups (A-I 92.6%, BI 89.5%, T 85.6% vs 76.6% for C, P = .002). Peripheral arterial occlusion was present more frequently in the A-I group (25.6% vs 13.8% BI, 10.5% T, and 10.8% C, P = .003). However, no differences were found in mean age, incidence of coronary artery disease, and American Society of Anesthesiologists III/IV classification. Implantation was achieved in 94.2% of the A-I group, 90.3% of the BI group, and 92% of the T group. No significant difference was seen in the operative mortality rate (4.2% A-I, 2.6% BI, O% T, 2.7% C). Postoperative cardiac complications were similar for the A-I (22%) and C (20.7%) groups but significantly less for the BI and T groups (13.4% and 10.5%, P = .019), whereas pulmonary problems were significantly reduced in all endograft groups (A-I 11.9%, BI 10.1%, and T 7.2% vs 22.5% for C, P = .002). Transient renal dysfunction occurred in 6.8% of the A-I group and 8.2% of the BI group but in only 3.3% of the T group and 1.8% of the C group (P = .028). Operating time was significantly longer for the A-I group than for the BI, T, or C groups (258 minutes vs 156, 179, and 174 minutes). Median blood loss, intensive care unit use, and hospital stays were markedly and significantly reduced in all endograft groups compared with the control group. The incidences of type I endoleak at 1 year were 2.4% A-I, 2.3% BI, and 3.8% T, and no ruptures occurred in any of the patients treated with endografts. No femoral-femoral graft thromboses occurred in the A-I group.\nDespite the fact that patients with combined aortic and iliac aneurysms have a more complex repair requirement and have an increased rate of comorbidity, the results are competitive with endovascular repair of aortic aneurysm by tube and bifurcated graft systems and are associated with a lower morbidity than open operation.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of the long-term function of endografts to exclude abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) includes determination of aneurysm dimensions and morphologic changes that occur after implantation. This study reports the dimensional analysis of patients treated with AneuRx bifurcated endoprostheses with postintervention, 1-year (n = 51), 2-year (n = 28), and 3-year (n = 10) postimplantation contrast computed tomography data.\nMaximal diameter (D) and cross-sectional area (CSA) of the AAA were measured from axial computed tomography images. Total volume, AAA thrombus volume (AAA volume minus the volume of the device and luminal blood flow), diameter of the aorta at the level of the renal arteries and within the device, distance from the renal arteries to the device, length of the device limbs, and the angle of the proximal neck were also determined at the same follow-up intervals after deployment with computed tomography angiograms reconstructed in an interactive environment.\nFifty-one of 98 consecutively treated patients with the AneuRx bifurcated prosthesis (29 \"stiff\" and 22 \"flexible\" body devices) had complete data from the postprocedure and follow-up computed tomography studies available for analysis. Max D, CSA, total volume of the AAA, and AAA thrombus volume decreased sequentially from year to year compared with the postimplantation values. D and CSA decreased or were unchanged in all except four patients, two who had unrestricted enlargement of the aneurysm with eventual rupture and one who had surgical conversion for continued expansion despite four diagnostic angiograms and attempted embolizations. Total volume of the AAA increased in 11 of 51 patients at 1 year, eight of whom had endoleaks at some interval during the follow-up. Thrombus volume increased more than 5% in four of these patients, including the two with eventual rupture and the one conversion. Patients with endoleaks who had spontaneous thrombosis or were successfully treated either remained at the same volume or had decreased volume on subsequent examinations. D at the renal arteries increased an average of 0.9 mm during the first year, with a concomitant increase of 2.8 mm within the proximal end of the device related to the self-expanding nature of the Nitinol suprastructure. Subsequent enlargement of the proximal neck continued at a slow rate in some cases but never exceeded the diameter of the endoluminal device. The distance from the renal arteries to the device increased by an average of 3 mm over the first year, with the greatest increases occurring in patients with a \"stiff\" body device and those with rapid regression (>10% total volume) in 1 year. As regression of the AAA occurred, the angle of the proximal neck varied from -5 degrees to +25 degrees from the original alignment. Limb length varied from -8 mm to +10 mm, with no consistent pattern for the change, that is, ipsilateral or contralateral limb.\nSignificant variation in the quantitation of aneurysm size occurs depending on the technique of computed tomography assessment used. In most patients diameter assessment is adequate, although volumetric analysis appears to be very helpful in certain patients who do not show aneurysm regression, or in whom the diameter increases or where endoleaks persist. Three-dimensional reconstruction and volumetric analysis are also useful to assess the mechanism by which the endovascular device accommodates to morphology changes and to determine criteria for reintervention.",

    "abstract": "Venous valves are delicate structures, the integrity of which is crucial for the normal function of the venous system. Their abnormalities lead to widespread disorders, ranging from chronic venous insufficiency to life-threatening thromboembolic phenomena. The discovery of the venous valves, however, has been the subject of hot controversy. Even though Fabricius ab Aquapendente is credited with the discovery by most historians, we demonstrate in this paper that other anatomists described them many years before Fabricius ab Aquapendente publicly demonstrated them in Padua in 1579. A thorough review of the historical literature surrounding the discovery of the venous valves was carried out from 1545 to the present under the supervision of the Medical History Department of our institution. Research was performed at the History of Medicine Division of the National Library of Medicine and through MEDLINE access to the medical literature. The Parisian Charles Estienne first mentioned the venous valves in his 1545 publication when he described \"apophyses membranarum\" in the veins of the liver. Lusitanus and Canano publicly demonstrated them in the azygos vein during cadaver dissections performed in Ferrera, Italy. The Parisian Jacques Sylvius described valves in the veins of the extremities in 1555. The work of these anatomists, however, could not achieve full recognition, because Andreas Vesalius, the leading anatomist at that time, was unable to confirm their findings and strongly denied the existence of venous valves. Vesalius's influence was so powerful that research on the subject was idle until 1579, when Fabricius ab Aquapendente \"discovered\" the venous valves. About the same time, the German Salomon Alberti published the first drawings of a venous valve (in 1585). William Harvey, a disciple of Fabricius ab Aquapendente, finally postulated the function of the venous valves, providing anatomical support for one of the greatest discoveries in medicine: the blood circulation. Therefore, our investigations revealed that Estienne and Canano discovered the venous valves in the 1530s. Fabricius ab Aquapendente's achievement was their full recognition 64 years later. However, it was not until 1628 that their function was fully understood, with the discovery of the blood circulation by William Harvey.",

    "abstract": "A new technique to obtain a segment of the superficial femoral artery as an arterial conduit in young patients while an unobstructed peripheral blood flow is maintained by superficial femoral artery-deep femoral artery transposition is illustrated with two clinical examples. The explanted arterial autograft requires no replacement by another graft and provides a conduit of up to 10 cm in length. Excellent results were achieved in both patients at 1 year. This technique is recommended instead of saphenous vein conduits in very young patients because of the risk for late vein degeneration.",

Until recently, surgical repair was the only method of treatment and was associated with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality. With the rapid development of aortic stent-graft technique, endovascular stent-graft repair may offer an alternative to the management of this often fatal condition. We report a case of an aortoiliac aneurysm with an aortocaval fistula successfully treated with endovascular stent-grafting. The unique hemodynamic changes, technical problems, and complications associated with this case are discussed, and the literature is reviewed.",

The use of umbilical artery catheters in the management of critically ill neonates has been associated with infection and subsequent aneurysm formation.

Through an analysis of the literature, we identified two factors that had significant correlation with improved survival: diagnosis before surgery and surgical repair (P <.05). This report presents the case of a 23-day-old neonate with an abdominal aortic aneurysm and hypertension.

This study examines the expression of G-proteins in the developing intimal hyperplasia after balloon injury of the rat carotid artery and specifically tests the hypothesis that the pertussis toxin sensitive G(i) G-protein subunit plays a role in the initiation of intimal hyperplasia.\nIn vitro responses to serum stimulation (10% fetal bovine serum) were examined in the presence and absence of pertussis toxin (PTx). After a standard balloon injury in male Sprague-Dawley rats, the expression of G-protein subunits (alpha(o), alpha(i), alpha(q), alpha(s), and betagamma) was determined by means of Western blotting in the first 28 days. Thereafter, a second set of animals was allocated to control and PTx-treated (a Galpha(i) inhibitor; 500 ng/mL in an externally applied 30% pluronic gel) groups. Smooth muscle cell proliferation was estimated by means of thymidine analogue 5-bromo-2' deoxyuridine incorporation 2 days after injury, and vessel dimensions were determined by means of videomorphometry 14 days after injury.\nThere was inhibition of DNA synthesis and smooth muscle cell proliferation in response to serum with an IC(50) of 100 ng/mL. Three days after balloon injury, there was an increase in Galpha(i3) expression, which decreased at days 7, 14, and 28, compared with the uninjured carotid. Galpha(q) expression increased in a time-dependent manner. There was a marked time-dependent increase in Gbetagamma in the 28 days. Galpha(i2) and Galpha(s) isoforms (45 and 52 kDa) did not change significantly with time. There was no major change in Galpha(i1) and Galpha(o) in the study period. At 14 days, PTx treatment reduced intimal hyperplasia by 52% (63 +/- 4 microm vs. 30 +/- 5 microm, control vs. PTx; P <.001). Medial smooth muscle cell proliferation at day 2 was decreased in the PTx group, compared with that in the gel-coated group (15% +/- 2% and 26% +/- 3%; P = .02).\nAfter balloon injury, there is a time-dependent increase in G-protein expression, which is subunit specific. Activation of PTx sensitive G-proteins (Galpha(i)) is involved during the initiation of intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury, and their inhibition results in a decrease in early medial cell proliferation. This acute interruption of G(i) signaling produces a long-term decrease in intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Tissue factor (TF)-initiated thrombin generation has been implicated in the development of intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury. An increase in intimal TF expression has been shown to precede the development of intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts. This study examines the effects of local treatment with recombinant human tissue factor pathway inhibitor (rTFPI) in experimental vein grafts.\nThirty-six male New Zealand white rabbits underwent bypass grafting of the carotid artery by use of the reversed ipsilateral jugular vein and were divided into four groups. Twenty animals had ex vivo incubation with rTFPI treatment (50 microg x mL(-1); n = 10) or placebo vehicle (control; n = 10). Sixteen animals received both ex vivo incubation and in vivo gel treatment with rTFPI (50 microg. mL(-1); n = 8) or without rTFPI (gel-control; n = 8). After operation, vein grafts were harvested at 3 days for immunohistochemical and Western analyses and at 28 days for histomorphologic study.\nWestern analysis demonstrated a 6.2-fold reduction in the expression of TF protein with rTFPI treatment in comparison to without rTFPI treatment. CD-18 leukocyte staining was diminished, whereas Tie-2 endothelial staining was increased in all rTFPI-treated vein grafts, compared with control and gel-control vein grafts. Intimal thickness was reduced by 21% with ex vivo rTFPI treatment compared with placebo (69 +/- 4 versus 87 +/- 5 microm; P <.05) and by 30% with the addition of rTFPI in vivo compared with gel-control (60 +/- 4 versus 86 +/- 5 microm; P <.01).\nLocal administration of rTFPI exerts early beneficial effects and limits the development of intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts. Therefore blocking TF-mediated pathway may offer new therapeutic options to reduce vein graft failure.",

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that a program of upper limb exercise training can induce significant improvements in walking distance in patients with claudication. This study assessed whether upper limb exercise avoids the systemic inflammatory responses associated with lower limb exercise and also whether the inflammatory response to acute lower limb exertion is modified by a program of supervised exercise training.\nFifty-two patients with stable intermittent claudication were randomized into two groups who underwent 6 weeks of supervised upper (n = 26) or lower (n = 26) limb cardiorespiratory exercise training. A parallel control group (n = 15) was provided with lifestyle advice only. Neutrophil activation markers (CD11b and CD66b) and plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (marker of endothelial damage) in response to an acute bout of sustained upper and lower limb exercise were assessed before and after the period of training. Plasma levels of soluble E-selectin (marker of endothelial activation) were also determined before and after the training period.\nAn acute bout of sustained lower limb exercise significantly increased the intensity of CD11b and CD66b expression by peripheral blood neutrophils in all groups, whereas upper limb exercise had no effect. Resting neutrophil expression of CD11b and CD66b and circulating von Willebrand factor levels were unaffected by the training program, as were the inflammatory responses to an acute bout of sustained upper and lower limb muscular work, despite the fact that both training programs significantly increased walking distances.\nThese findings indicate that upper limb exercise training programs may offer certain advantages over currently prescribed lower limb programs. Our results show that exercising nonischemic muscles in a way that promotes improved cardiorespiratory function and walking capacity can avoid the potentially deleterious systemic inflammatory responses associated with lower limb exertion in patients with stable intermittent claudication.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the results of surgical treatment in a series of patients who underwent operation for isolated spontaneous dissection of the renal artery. The feasibility of renal artery reconstruction is emphasized.\nDuring a 21-year period (1978-1998), 22 patients (17 men, 5 women) with spontaneous dissection of the renal artery underwent operation. Their mean age was 41 +/- 8.4 years. All patients were admitted with uncontrollable arterial hypertension and underwent the usual investigations performed in subjects with hypertension. Because of bilateral lesions (3 patients), surgical treatment consisted of eight nephrectomies (6 total, 2 partial) and 17 arterial repairs (in 16 patients) carried out by conventional in situ surgery (6 cases) or by extracorporeal repair (11 cases).\nThere were no postoperative deaths or morbidity in this series. Arterial hypertension was cured in 9 patients (41%), improved in 11 (50%), and unchanged in 2 (9%). Anatomic results of repairs were excellent in 13 patients (81%) and incomplete in three (19%). During long-term follow-up, one late thrombosis of a repaired polar artery and one spontaneous dissection of the contralateral renal artery occurred. In eight patients, late angiographies showed that the results of reconstructions remained stable with time.\nSurgical treatment of isolated spontaneous dissection of the renal artery is indicated in patients who have severe uncontrollable hypertension despite extensive medical treatment. Arterial repair is the ideal treatment. It is often possible even when complex lesions are present; in such cases ex vivo surgery affords great safety and ease of repair. Results concerning control of hypertension are satisfactory.",

To investigate the pattern of response within the individual venous segment, we used sequential duplex scanning to determine whether certain segments are more likely to recanalize or remain occluded.\nThe anatomic segments involved in 63 above-knee DVTs were examined with duplex scanning at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year after the acute event. The segments under investigation were the external iliac vein (EIV), common femoral vein (CFV), superficial femoral vein (SFV), and popliteal vein (PV). Reflux studies were performed at each follow-up examination. During the follow-up period the segments were examined to see whether they were occluded, partially recanalized, or totally recanalized and the development of reflux was noted.\nMost DVTs were multisegmental with a total number of 171 sites involved. Initially, a greater number of segments were occluded (71%) than partially thrombosed (29%). The occluded segments were predominantly in the SFV and PV. At 1 year the thrombi had fully resolved in 60% of the venous segments, 27% remained partially recanalized, and 13% were occluded. The venous segments that resolved within the first 6 months had a higher rate of valvular competence than those that resolved from 6 months to 1 year. The SFV and PV had a higher incidence of valvular incompetence than the EIV and CFV. All venous segments that were partially recanalized at 1 year were found to have significant reflux. The SFV had the highest incidence of total occlusion at the end of 1 year (36%). Many of the occluded SFVs had established collateral pathways that displayed no evidence of reflux.\nThe lower extremity venous segments differ in respect to their tendencies to partially or fully recanalize or remain occluded. All partially recanalized segments displayed reflux. Fully resolved segments that recanalized within the first 6 months were more likely to have competent valves than those that recanalized after 6 months. In the presence of an occluded SFV, collateral pathways establish rapidly. No reflux was found in these collaterals.",

    "abstract": "The choice of therapy for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremity during pregnancy has been widely debated. Warfarin passes through the placenta to the fetus and may cause fetal complications and/or death. Heparin, in contrast, does not cross the placenta, but its long-term use may be impractical and may increase the risk of bleeding, osteoporosis, and neurologic complications. The use of inferior vena cava filters in pregnancy has only been described as case reports in the English medical literature; therefore, this study reviews our experience on this subject.\nWe analyzed 18 pregnant patients who had Greenfield filters (GFs) inserted for DVT of the lower extremity, pulmonary embolism (PE), or both. The DVT diagnosis was made by means of duplex imaging. Conventional full-dose intravenous heparin was initiated until the filter was inserted, followed by subcutaneous heparin until labor, and continued for 6 weeks postpartum in 13 patients who were breast-feeding. Warfarin was given postpartum in the other five patients.\nThe mean age of the patients was 25 years. The indications for GF insertion included 3 patients who had a PE while on anticoagulation, 2 patients with significant bleeding caused by anticoagulation, 4 patients with free-floating iliofemoral DVT, 2 patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and 7 patients with iliofemoropopliteal DVT occurring 1 to 3 weeks before labor, for prophylactic reasons. Fourteen of 18 cases were diagnosed in the third trimester of the patient's pregnancy. Filters were inserted via the right internal jugular vein by means of a cut-down technique in the first four patients (stainless steel filters) and percutaneously in 14 patients. The mean fluoroscopy time during filter insertion was less than 2 minutes. There was no fetal or maternal morbidity or mortality. During long-term follow-up (mean, 78 months), no PE or filter-related complications were encountered.\nGF insertion in pregnant patients with DVT of the lower extremity is safe and effective. Its prophylactic use in pregnant patients who have extensive iliofemoral DVT right before labor may be justified.",

    "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to describe the venous valves and determine their fate over time in reversed saphenous vein (RSV) and in situ saphenous vein (ISV) bypass grafts with duplex ultrasonography.\nSixty-four patients contributed 50 RSV and 19 ISV infrainguinal vein grafts. Forty-two of the RSVs and 17 of the ISVs had valves or valve remnants. The grafts and valves were studied serially with duplex ultrasonography to document the location, characteristics, and changes with time. The valve leaflets visualized by means of ultrasonic duplex scanning were described as moving, frozen, remnant of a cusp, or \"functioning.\" In addition, the presence of a valve sinus and thickening of the wall at the site were documented. Grafts were studied at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months and then annually.\nIn 42 RSV grafts (84%) and 17 ISV grafts (89.5%), 200 valves were identified. Only five of the 200 valves (2.5%) required intervention because of a velocity ratio (VR) of 3.5 or greater. Eight (42.1%) of the 19 ISV grafts needed 15 revisions, and 18 (36%) of the 50 RSV grafts required 30 revisions. The five revisions for a stenotic valve occurred only in RSV grafts. From the 30 revisions in the RSV grafts, only 16.7% (5 of 30) were for a valve-related stenosis. The average follow-up period for a valve from the time of detection was 16.1 +/- 9.6 months. Ten of the 17 (58.8%) valve-associated stenoses (VR > 2.5) showed a regression to a VR less than 2.0 within a mean time of 3.1 months (range, 1.5-4.5 months). A progression of the valve-associated lesion from a VR less than 2.0 to a VR higher than 3.5 occurred in only one case within a period of 3.5 months.\nThe described features of valves in saphenous vein grafts are common and can be identified by means of duplex sonography. Only 16.7% of the revisions in RSV grafts were performed because of a valve-related stenosis, and none of the revisions in ISV grafts were performed because of a valve lesion. Lesions associated with a valve may regress in time. No specific valve features could be identified as \"high\" risk for graft failure.",

    "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that the course of primary chronic venous insufficiency can be changed by correction of the incompetent valve in the superficial femoral vein.\nThis was a prospective, randomized, controlled study. A total of 125 extremities with reflux in greater saphenous and superficial femoral veins and belonging to clinical classes C2-C4 were analyzed. During the first 5 years, the type of clinical dynamics and changes in valvular function were determined in each patient. Patients were stratified according to the type of clinical dynamics and randomly assigned to treatment groups. Phlebectomy was performed in all extremities. In each of 64 extremities (the study group), the proximal incompetent superficial femoral vein valve was corrected as a part of the primary intervention. Patients were followed up for 7 to 8 years after surgery.\nThe clinical dynamics of the extremity significantly depended on reflux changes. Increase in superficial femoral vein reflux was found in 74% of the extremities with progressive clinical dynamics but in only 47% of extremities with stable clinical dynamics (chi(2) = 9.71; P <.01). After surgical treatment, 65% of the extremities in the control group showed stable improvement; in 11%, recurrent varicosity was found; in 24%, the disease was aggravated. Of the extremities in the study group, 86% had stable improvement, 5% had recurrent varicosity, and 10% were aggravated (P <.05). Extremities with the progressive type of clinical dynamics were main contributors to this difference (chi(2) = 7.86; P <.05). In 92% of the extremities with corrected valves and in 50% of the extremities with increase in reflux after valvuloplasty, clinical improvement was observed (chi(2) = 11.5; P <.01). Extremities with corrected valvular function demonstrated superior results in comparison with extremities with stable valvular function in the control group (clinical improvement in 92% and 66% of extremities, respectively; P <.005).\nIn patients with chronic venous insufficiency, two types of clinical dynamics, stable and progressive, can be identified. The progressive type is associated with the presence of superficial femoral vein reflux and increasing greater saphenous vein reflux. Superficial vein surgery neither corrects superficial femoral vein reflux nor prevents it from progressing further. Correction of a single superficial femoral vein valve during primary intervention significantly improves the long-term results of superficial venous surgery. This improvement is associated with the prevention of reflux progression. Surgical correction of the incompetent superficial femoral vein valve changes the course of primary chronic venous insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess and to compare perioperative changes in left ventricular function and the incidence of adverse cardiac events in two groups of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms, one during endovascular aneurysm repair (EAR) and the other during open aneurysm repair (OAR).\nOne hundred twenty consecutive patients who underwent EAR (49 patients) or OAR (71 patients) were prospectively studied. During the operation, the left ventricular function was assessed by the recording of the left ventricle stroke work index (SWI) and the cardiac index (CI) with a pulmonary artery catheter. Measurements were performed before, during, and after stent-graft deployment or aortic cross-clamping. Both maneuvers were defined as aortic occlusion (AO). Transesophageal echocardiography was performed to identify signs of wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricular wall, which indicated myocardial ischemia. Six-lead electrocardiograph monitoring was maintained until discharge from the intensive care unit. Postoperative cardiac complications were diagnosed by clinical observation, 12-lead ECG analysis at 1, 3, and 7 days after the operation, transthoracic echocardiography at 1 month, and measurement of cardiac enzymes.\nThe two study groups were comparable with regard to most clinical aspects. The baseline myocardial performance was worse in patients who underwent EAR compared with patients who underwent OAR, as indicated by a reduced SWI (33.1 and 37.4, respectively; P =.03). During AO there was a comparable increase of the CI in both groups. However, after AO the rise in CI was higher in patients who underwent OAR compared with patients who underwent EAR (0.7 and 0.2, respectively; P <.01), representing a more pronounced hyperdynamic state. In addition, the SWI demonstrated a decrease in patients who underwent OAR compared with an increase in patients who underwent EAR during AO (-1.4 and +1.9, respectively; P =.04) and after AO (-0.9 and +2.6, respectively; P =.01). These findings represent more severe myocardial stress in patients who underwent OAR. The incidence of postoperative clinical cardiac adverse events was comparable in the two study groups. However, myocardial ischemia, as indicated by electrocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography, had a higher incidence in patients who underwent open surgery as compared with patients whose condition was managed endovascularly (57% and 33%, respectively; P =.01).\nHemodynamic alterations during endovascular repair were not as severe as those in patients with open surgery and indicated less myocardial stress in the former category. These findings may explain a lower incidence of myocardial ischemia that was observed during endovascular repair. A lower frequency of clinical perioperative cardiac events in patients undergoing endovascular treatment may ultimately be expected.",

    "abstract": "This study estimated the association between age and in-hospital postoperative complications, controlling for known or suspected risk factors, in a series of patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery (AAR).\nThis retrospective cohort study of outcome data with multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted at Emory University Hospital, a tertiary care, university-affiliated hospital. All patients undergoing elective AAR between Jan 1, 1986, and Aug 1, 1996, were included (n = 856). An estimate of the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI for the association between patient age and in-hospital major morbidity or mortality after elective AAR was made, controlling for significant risk factors.\nAmong the 856 patients, 170 had a nonfatal complication (136 with major and 34 with minor complications), and 11 patients (1.3%) died. The final logistic regression model demonstrated a mild association between increasing age and rate of major postoperative complications, including death (for each increase in age of 10 years: OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.00-1.52; P =.052). Other significant covariates in the final model included cardiac disease (OR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.18-6.86; P =.020), pulmonary disease (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.35-2.84; P =.0004), and renal disease (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.66-3.99; P =.0001). Increasing age was associated with a moderate increase in the rate of death (for each increase in age of 10 years: OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.22-6.16; P =.015) in a model with cardiac disease as the only significant covariate (OR, 14.67; 95% CI, 3.46-62.16; P =.0003).\nFor patients undergoing elective AAR, increasing patient age is associated with a small increase in risk for in-hospital morbidity or mortality. However, significant cardiac, pulmonary, or renal disease is associated with a much greater risk of postoperative complications, and, therefore, advanced age should not be the sole basis of exclusion for otherwise suitable candidates for elective AAR.",

    "abstract": "Although endovascular grafts have been increasingly applied to the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms, their use in clinical trials is limited by well-defined anatomical exclusion criteria. One such criterion is the presence of thrombus within the infrarenal neck of an aneurysm, which is thought to (1) prevent the creation of a permanent watertight seal between the graft and the vessel wall, resulting in an endoleak; (2) contribute to stent migration; and (3) increase the risk of thromboembolism. This article summarizes our experience with endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm exclusion in 19 patients with large aortic aneurysms, significant medical comorbidities, and apparent thrombus extending into the pararenal aortic neck.\nOf 268 patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, 19 (7%; 17 men; mean age, 71 years) demonstrated computed tomographic and angiographic evidence of intramural filling defects at the level of the aortic neck. In no instance did these filling defects extend above the renal arteries. Endovascular grafting was performed through use of a balloon-expandable Palmaz stent and an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft, delivered and deployed under fluoroscopic guidance. Follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months and annually thereafter was performed with computed tomography and duplex ultrasound scan.\nSpiral computed tomography and aortography revealed an irregular flow-limiting defect, occupying up to 75% of the aortic circumference, in every case. The mean aneurysm size, aortic neck diameter, and neck length before the procedure were 6.1, 2.43, and 1.4 cm, respectively; the mean aortic neck diameter after the procedure was 2.61 cm. No primary endoleaks were observed after graft insertion, and no delayed endoleaks have been detected during follow-up, which ranged from 7 to 48 months (mean, 23 months). In one patient, an asymptomatic renal artery embolus was detected on immediate follow-up computed tomography, and in another patient, an asymptomatic posterior tibial embolus occurred.\nNo primary endoleaks, endograft migration, or significant distal embolization were observed after endografting in patients with aortic neck thrombus. The deployment of the fenestrated portion of the stent, above the thrombus and across the renal arteries, allows for effective renal perfusion, graft fixation, and exclusion of potential mural thrombus from the circulation. The presence of aortic neck thrombus may not necessarily be a contraindication to endovascular repair in select patients.",

    "abstract": "It was suggested that in the absence of cardioembolism the discrete subcortical and cortical infarctions on brain computed tomography (CT) are most likely associated with carotid atheroma, whereas the hemodynamic infarctions, diffuse widespread white matter lesions, lacunae and basal ganglia infarctions are most likely associated with other pathologic conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the ultrasonic characteristics of carotid plaques and the degree of stenosis that were associated with the different brain CT infarction patterns and normal CT (pattern A, discrete subcortical and cortical infarctions; pattern B, hemodynamic infarctions, diffuse widespread white matter lesions, lacunae and basal ganglia infarctions).\nFour hundred nineteen carotid plaques (315 patients), producing 50% to 99% stenosis on duplex scanning, were studied. These plaques were imaged on duplex scanning, captured, digitized, and normalized (standardized) in a computer. Subsequently, their gray scale median (GSM) was evaluated to distinguish quantitatively the hypoechoic (low GSM) from the hyperechoic (high GSM) plaques. The brain CT infarction patterns of A, B, or normal CT on the ipsilateral hemisphere were noted.\nThe pattern A brain CT infarction was associated with carotid plaques having median GSM of 11 and median degree of stenosis of 80%, as contrasted with pattern B (median GSM, 28.5; median degree of stenosis, 75%) or normal CT (median GSM, 22; median degree of stenosis, 75%) (Kruskal-Wallis test, P <.001 for the GSM and P =.002 for the degree of stenosis). In the logistic regression analysis only the GSM and not the degree of stenosis distinguished the plaques associated with the three CT patterns.\nThe pattern A brain CT infarction was associated with hypoechoic plaques suggesting an involvement of extracranial carotid artery embolization, whereas the pattern B was associated with hyperechoic plaques suggesting an involvement of other mechanisms (hemodynamic, intracranial small and large vessel disease).",

Scores were compared with population normal values.\nIn 50 patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease, there was significant improvement in the SF-36 overall \"change in health\" score after the procedure compared with beforehand (61.0 +/- 3.7 vs 44.5 +/- 3.4, P =.003, Wilcoxon signed rank test). There were, however, no statistically significant differences in the group's mean SF-36 subscores after operation compared with before the procedure.

Patients with postoperative complications did not have an improved change in health score (-12.5 vs 22.0, P =.03, Mann-Whitney U test). There was no effect on change in health score because of other risk factors or in patients with contralateral carotid artery occlusion or a history of preoperative stroke.\nPatients with symptomatic carotid artery disease undergoing an uncomplicated carotid endarterectomy perceive improved quality of life and overall health. There is no perception of worsened pain, energy, or physical or mental function after the procedure. These results confirm that patients believe that performance of carotid endarterectomy improves their overall health, supporting the surgical approach to carotid artery disease.",

In this report we updated our experience.\nThe clinical data of all patients who underwent venous reconstruction for iliofemoral or inferior vena caval (IVC) occlusion due to nonmalignant disease between January 1985 and June 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were classified, and outcomes were compared according to the guidelines of the Joint Vascular Societies.\nForty-two patients, 23 males and 19 females (mean age, 40 years; range, 16-81), underwent 44 venous reconstructions. Thirty-six patients had limb swelling or venous claudication, 38 had pain, and 14 had healed or active ulcers. The cause of obstruction was congenital in two and acquired in 40 (deep vein thrombosis, 25; trauma, 5; retroperitoneal fibrosis, 4; IVC occlusion devices, 4; others, 2). Eighteen patients underwent saphenous vein crossover grafts (Palma procedure), 17 had expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts implanted (femorocaval, 8; iliocaval, 5; crossfemoral, 3; cavoatrial, 1), 6 patients had spiral vein grafts (5 iliac/femoral and 1 cavoatrial), and 1 underwent femoral vein patch angioplasty. Clinical follow-up averaged 3.5 years (median, 2.5), and graft follow-up with imaging studies averaged 2.6 years (median, 1.6). Seven patients were lost to follow-up. The secondary 3-year patency rate for all reconstructions was 62%. Palma procedures had a 4-year patency rate of 83%. The secondary patency rate of iliocaval and femorocaval ePTFE bypass grafts at 2 years was 54%. The secondary patency was lower in patients with an arteriovenous fistula (P =.023). All ePTFE grafts had a 45% patency rate at 2 years, not significantly different from saphenous vein grafts (83%, P =.16).

Optimal treatment, especially the role of surgery, is controversial. The long-term functional outcome of a cohort of patients undergoing independent medical examination for disputed NTOS with symptoms sufficiently severe to cause inability to work forms the basis for this report.\nPatients with disputed NTOS and symptoms sufficiently severe to cause at least temporary inability to work seen for independent medical examinations from 1990-1998 formed the study group. None of the patients were treated by our group. Functional outcome was assessed with information from a standardized telephone interview or patient questionnaire. The patients' ability to return to work and an assessment of their current level of symptoms and symptom progression since the time of onset were determined.\nSeventy-nine patients were reevaluated at a mean follow-up of 4.2 years (range, 2-7.5 years) after our initial evaluation. Fifteen patients (19%) underwent first rib resection surgery performed by others, whereas 64 (81%) had no surgery. Patients undergoing surgery had missed more work time than those undergoing conservative management (27.6 +/- 6.0 months vs 14.9 +/- 2.6 months, P <.04). Return to work was achieved in nine patients who were operated on (60%) and in 50 patients who were not operated on (78%) (P = not significant [NS]).

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the current outcome in the United States and to identify predictors of mortality and \"bad outcome\" after open, intact abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.\nIn a retrospective analysis, data were obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample during 1994-1996. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample is a 20% all-payer stratified sample of nonfederal United States hospitals. Patients older than 49 years were identified by the presence of primary diagnostic (441.4-intact AAA) and procedure (38.44-resection of abdominal aorta with replacement) codes of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9 ). In-hospital mortality rate, discharge disposition, bad outcome (death or discharge to an institution), complications (ICD-9 postoperative codes), length of stay, and charges were determined. The mortality rate and bad outcome were analyzed by the use of patient demographics (age, sex, race), patient comorbidities (ICD-9 diagnostic codes), calendar year, and hospital characteristics (size, location, teaching status) with univariate and multivariate analyses.\nWe identified 16,450 intact AAAs repairs during the study years. The mean patient age was 72 +/- 7 (+/- SD) years, and most patients were male (79.7%) and white (94.6%). Most repairs were performed at large (67.3%), urban (92.5%), and nonteaching (66.7%) institutions. The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.2%, the overall complication rate was 32.4%, and 91.2% of patients were discharged home, whereas the bad outcome rate was 12.6%. The median length of stay was 8 days (mean, 10.0 +/- 8.1), and median hospital charges were $28,052 (mean, $35,681 +/- $33,006) in 1996 dollars. Multivariate analysis showed that the mortality rate (P <.05) increased with age (70-79 years, 1.8 odds ratio [OR] [95% CI, 1.4-2.3], > 79 years, 3.8 OR [95% CI, 2.9-4.9]), sex (female, 1.6 OR [95% CI, 1.3-1.9]), cerebral vascular occlusive disease (1.8 OR [95% CI, 1.3-2.5]), preoperative renal insufficiency (9.5 OR [95% CI, 7.7-11.7]), and more than three comorbidities (11.2 OR [95% CI, 3.6-35.4]). Multivariate analysis also showed that bad outcome was associated with the same variables in addition to hospital size (small/medium), year of procedure (1996), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and two to three comorbidities.\nOutcome after open repair of intact AAA across the United States is quite good. Older, sicker patients may benefit from nonoperative treatment or the potentially lower risk endovascular approaches.",

We sought to determine what device-related factors could be identified that might contribute to limb failure.\nWe reviewed the records of patients who had undergone endovascular AAA repair and femorofemoral bypass grafting at a single institution.\nEndovascular AAA repair was performed in 173 patients. There were 137 bifurcated endografts and 36 aortomonoiliac grafts combined with femorofemoral bypass grafts, yielding a total population of 310 aortic graft limbs and 36 femorofemoral grafts. Thirty-nine additional patients underwent femorofemoral bypass grafting for occlusive disease. The cumulative primary patency of all endografts performed for AAA was 92% at 21 months. Secondary patency was achieved for all failed endograft limbs. There were 24 aortic graft limb \"failures\" that required intervention: seven limbs underwent thrombosis requiring revision; kinked limbs requiring stenting either at the time of graft placement (17) or subsequently (7) were identified. Fully supported endograft limbs had better primary patency (97% at 18 months) than unsupported limbs (69% at 18 months, P <.001). The aortomonoiliac grafts with femorofemoral bypass grafts tended to have better patency (97% at 18 months) than bifurcated endografts (90% at 18 months), but this did not reach statistical significance (P =.28, not significant). Femorofemoral grafts performed for occlusive disease were found to have somewhat lower patency than those performed for AAA (83% vs 92% at 18 months of follow-up, P =.37, not significant).\nFully supported AAA endografts provide superior endograft limb patency compared with unsupported designs. Consideration should be given to routine stenting of all unsupported endograft limbs. Aortomonoiliac grafts and bifurcated grafts provide similar results for endograft limb patency. Femorofemoral bypass grafts performed in conjunction with aortomonoiliac grafts for AAA disease provide excellent short-term patency.",

    "abstract": "Precise diameter changes in iliac artery aneurysms (IAAs) after endovascular graft (EVG) repair are yet to be determined. This report describes the midterm size changes in isolated IAAs 13 to 72 months after treatment with an EVG.\nFrom January 1993 to April 1999, 31 patients with 35 true isolated IAAs (32 common iliac and 3 hypogastric) had these lesions treated with EVGs and coil embolization of the hypogastric artery or its branches. The EVG used in this study consisted of a balloon-expandable stent attached to a polytetrafluoroethylene graft. Contrast-enhanced spiral computed tomographic scans were performed at 3- to 6-month intervals to follow the aneurysms for change in diameter and endoleaks.\nThirty patients had a decrease in the size of their iliac aneurysms with EVG repair. All EVGs remained patent. All patients, except for one, were followed up for 13 to 72 months (mean, 31 months). The pretreatment aneurysm size ranged from 2.5 to 11.0 cm in diameter (mean, 4.6 +/- 1.62 cm). After EVG treatment, the aneurysms ranged from 2.0 to 8.0 cm in diameter (mean, 3.8 +/- 1.36 cm). The change in aneurysm diameter ranged from 0.5 to 3.1 cm (mean, 1.1 +/- 0.62 cm) with an average change of -0.516 +/- 0.01 cm/y for the first year. Five patients died of their intercurrent medical conditions during the follow-up period. One of the patients had a new endoleak and an increase in common iliac aneurysm size 18 months after EVG treatment, despite an early contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan that showed no endoleak. This patient's aneurysm ruptured, and a standard open surgical repair was successfully performed. Another patient had a decrease in hypogastric aneurysm size after EVG treatment and no radiographic evidence of an endoleak, but eventually the aneurysm ruptured. He was successfully treated with a standard open surgical repair.\nEVGs can be an effective treatment for isolated IAAs. Properly treated with EVGs, IAAs decrease in size. The enlargement of an IAA, even if no endoleak can be detected, appears to be an ominous sign suggestive of an impending rupture. IAAs that enlarge should be closely evaluated for an endoleak. If an endoleak is detected, it should be eliminated if possible. If an endoleak cannot be found, open surgical repair should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Mesenteric revascularization for chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) traditionally involves antegrade or retrograde bypass graft originating from the supraceliac or infrarenal aorta. The distal thoracic aorta (DTA) may provide a better inflow source than the abdominal aorta. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results with the DTA used as inflow for the surgical treatment of CMI.\nAll patients undergoing mesenteric revascularization for CMI with grafts originating from the DTA were identified from 1990 to 1999. A ninth interspace thoracoretroperitoneal incision was used for exposure, and distal aortic flow was maintained by use of a partial occlusion clamp.\nEighteen consecutive patients with CMI underwent mesenteric bypass grafting with the DTA used as inflow. All patients were admitted with chronic abdominal pain or weight loss, with two (12%) requiring urgent revascularization because of acute exacerbation of chronic symptoms. Fourteen (78%) patients had both celiac and superior mesenteric artery bypass grafts placed, and three (17%) patients had superior mesenteric artery grafts alone. There was one (6%) perioperative death and three (17%) major complications. There was no kidney failure, mesenteric infarction, or spinal cord ischemia. The life-table survival rate was 89%, 89%, and 76% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. All 18 patients remained symptom free and required no additional procedures to assist patency. There was no evidence of graft stenosis or occlusion (100% patency) for those grafts evaluated objectively during the mean follow-up of 34.8 months (range, 1-97 months).\nAntegrade mesenteric revascularization with the DTA used as inflow is associated with low morbidity and mortality rates. Furthermore, it provides excellent midterm patency and survival results and should be considered as a primary approach for reconstruction of patients with CMI.",

Fourteen (78%) patients had both celiac and superior mesenteric artery bypass grafts placed, and three (17%) patients had superior mesenteric artery grafts alone. There was one (6%) perioperative death and three (17%) major complications. There was no kidney failure, mesenteric infarction, or spinal cord ischemia. The life-table survival rate was 89%, 89%, and 76% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. All 18 patients remained symptom free and required no additional procedures to assist patency. There was no evidence of graft stenosis or occlusion (100% patency) for those grafts evaluated objectively during the mean follow-up of 34.8 months (range, 1-97 months).",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasound surveillance (DUS) after autogenous lower extremity bypass grafting is controversial. Specific criteria mandating graft revision are not uniform. It has been suggested that grafts harboring critical stenoses undergo revision, whereas those with intermediate stenoses undergo arteriography with selective repair. We sought to define the natural history and determine the risk of graft occlusion associated with unrepaired vein graft stenoses.\nWe analyzed serial vascular laboratory and clinical data of 156 autogenous infrainguinal vein grafts in 142 patients. Grafts were categorized into three groups according to the first DUS-detected (index) lesion: (1) normal (peak systolic velocity [PSV] < 200 cm/s, velocity ratio [V(r)] < 2); (2) intermediate stenosis (200 cm/s < PSV < 300 cm/s, 2 < V(r) < 4); and (3) critical (PSV > 300 cm/s, V(r) > 4). Our policy was to repair grafts with critical lesions and monitor all others. The risks of stenosis progression, graft revision, and graft thrombosis for each group were compared.\nSerial DUS was normal in 100 (64%) grafts. The incidence of graft thrombosis in the normal group was 3% per year (mean follow-up, 27.5 months). Intermediate lesions developed in 32 grafts (20%) and were followed. Among these 32 grafts with intermediate stenoses, 63% progressed to critical and were revised, and 32% resolved or stabilized (mean follow-up, 26 months). Only one graft occlusion occurred in grafts with intermediate lesions subjected to serial DUS monitoring (incidence 1.5% per year, P = not significant). In the third group, 16 of 25 grafts with critical lesions were successfully revised and remain patent. In nine cases, critical lesions were not repaired, resulting in seven (78%) occlusions, all within 4 months of DUS detection.\nSerial surveillance is safe and effective for grafts with intermediate stenoses. The graft occlusion rate for such grafts with careful monitoring is no different from grafts without stenosis, and therefore, arteriography is not indicated in the absence of progression to critical stenosis. The short-term risk of graft occlusion in the presence of an unrevised critical stenosis is nearly 80%. These data have important clinical implications concerning the natural history of vein graft lesions.",

    "abstract": "Tibial artery bypass for limb salvage may be required in patients without adequate autogenous vein. The interposition of venous tissue at the distal anastomosis has been advocated to improve the results of prosthetic grafts to tibial arteries. Having reported on technical feasibility and an early experience with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and a distal vein patch (DVP), we examine the results of this technique with 4-year follow-up.\nFrom July 1993 to July 1999, 514 tibial bypass grafts were performed, with 80 bypass grafts in 79 patients with PTFE/DVP as the conduit. Patient demographics included 39 men and 40 women (mean age, 67 years); 42 had diabetes mellitus (53%), 16 had renal failure (20%), and 48 had Eagle criteria for increased cardiac risk (60%). Indications for revascularization were rest pain in 39 (49%) and tissue loss in 41 (51%). Lack of adequate vein resulted from previous failed lower extremity bypass graft (47 [59%]), previous coronary bypass graft (21 [26%]), unsuitable vein (8 [10%]), and absent vein due to ligation and stripping (4 [5%]). Follow-up ranged from 1 to 48 months. Results are reported as primary patency or limb salvage +/- SE.\nBypass grafts originated from the common femoral artery (40 [50%]), the superficial femoral artery (6 [8%]), and the external iliac artery (34 [43%]). Recipient arteries included anterior tibial (17 [21%]), posterior tibial (28 [35%]), and peroneal (35 [44%]). Four-year primary patency and limb salvage rates were 62.89% +/- 10.6% and 79.21% +/- 8.45%, respectively. There was a 24% mortality rate during the follow-up period. Acute failure occurred in 7 grafts with 5 immediate amputations and 2 revisions. A total of 17 grafts failed during the follow-up period, leading to 11 amputations.\nThe DVP technique allows PTFE bypass grafts to tibial arteries with acceptable long-term patency and limb salvage.",

The purpose of this review is to evaluate the long-term results of autogenous composite vein grafts used for infrainguinal arterial bypass grafting.\nWe retrospectively evaluated a prospective vascular registry and reviewed inpatient and office records.\nFrom June 1983 to September 1999, 165 autogenous composite vein infrainguinal bypass grafts were performed in 154 patients (87 men, 67 women; mean age, 69 years). The mean follow-up was 25 months (range, 3-147). Patients had the usual risk factors, including a 30% incidence of prior coronary bypass grafting. Forty-eight percent of bypass grafts were performed after failed previous reconstructions, and 90% were performed for limb salvage. The conduits were comprised of 2 segments (75%), 3 segments (23%), and 4 segments (2%). The distal anastomosis was at the popliteal level in 17% and the tibial/pedal level in 83%. The 30-day operative mortality rate was 1.8%. Perioperative graft failure (< 30 days) occurred in 18 bypass grafts (11%), resulting in early amputation (< 30 days) in 1.2%. The overall 5-year cumulative patency rates were 44% +/- 5% for primary patency, 63% +/- 5% for primary-assisted patency (PAP), and 65% +/- 5% for secondary patency (SP). A high revision rate for stenosis or thrombosis was required during follow-up to maintain patency of the grafts (27%). Limb salvage was 81% +/- 5% at 5 years. Primary reconstructions with composite vein fared significantly better than secondary reconstructions (SP 76% vs 54% at 5 years, P <.01). Arm vein composites showed superior patency compared with greater saphenous vein composites (SP 79% vs 61% at 5 years, P <.05).\nInfrainguinal reconstruction with autogenous composite vein results in durable graft patency and limb salvage rates in patients with few alternatives for revascularization. Intensive graft surveillance with aggressive graft revision is necessary to achieve these results.",

Patients with rest pain or ulcers were excluded. Data were analyzed with life-table and Cox hazard models.\nThe mean follow-up was 47 months. The cohort exhibited a mortality rate of 12% per year, which was significantly (P <.05) more than the age-adjusted US male population. Among the deaths in which the cause was known, 66% were due to heart disease. We examined several baseline risk factors in a multivariate Cox model. Four were significant (P <.01) independent predictors of death: older age (relative risk [RR] = 1.3 per decade), lower ankle-brachial index (RR = 1.2 for 0.2 change), diabetes requiring medication (RR = 1.4), and stroke (RR = 1.4). The model can be used to estimate the mortality rate for specific patients. Surprisingly, a history of angina and myocardial infarction was not a significant predictor. Major and minor amputations had a 10-year cumulative rate less than 10%. Revascularization procedures occurred with a 10-year cumulative rate of 18%.\nWe found a high mortality rate in this large cohort and four independent risk factors that have a large impact on survival. Risk stratification with our model may be useful in determining an overall therapeutic plan for claudicants. A history of angina and myocardial infarction was not a useful predictor of death, suggesting that many patients in our cohort presented with claudication before having coronary artery symptoms. Our data also indicate that claudicants have a low risk of major amputation at 10-year follow-up.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of emergency carotid thromboendarterectomy (CTEA) for acute internal carotid artery (ICA) thrombosis has been questioned. We evaluated the use of CTEA in patients with recent ICA occlusion.\nFrom August 1989 to December 1999 patients who underwent urgent CTEA for recent ICA thrombosis were retrospectively evaluated. Patient data analyzed included age, sex, comorbid risk factors, diagnostic evaluation, operative procedure, and long-term follow-up with clinical assessment and carotid duplex scan. Neurologic status was evaluated with the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) before the operation, immediately after the operation, and at 3- to 6-months' follow-up.\nTwenty-nine patients underwent emergency ipsilateral CTEA for acute ICA thrombosis over the last 10 years. The average age of the patients was 69.9 +/- 1.7 years, and 66% were men. Patient risk factors included diabetes (7 [24%]), hypertension (21 [72%]), coronary artery disease (8 [29%]), and history of tobacco abuse (20 [69%]). Presenting symptoms included cerebrovascular accident (7 [24%]), transient ischemic attack (nonamaurosis) (10 [34%]), crescendo transient ischemic attack (7 [24%]), stroke in evolution (2 [7%]), and amaurosis fugax (3 [10%]). Diagnostic evaluation included computed tomographic scan (29 [100%]), magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography (4 [14%]), duplex scan evaluation of the carotid arteries (23 [79%]), and cerebral angiography (18 [64%]). Antegrade flow in the ICA was successfully established in 24 (83%) of 29 patients and confirmed with intraoperative angiography or duplex sonography. Postoperative morbidity included 2 hematomas (7%), 4 transient cranial nerve deficits (14%), and 1 conversion to hemorrhagic stroke (3.6%), which resulted in the only death (3.6%). MRS scores averaged 3.4 +/- 0.2 preoperatively. Follow-up averaging 74.1 +/- 21 months (range, 3-140 months) was obtained in 27 (93%) patients. Improvement or deterioration was defined as a change in MRS +/- 1. Immediately postoperatively, 14 (48%) patients were improved, 2 (7%) deteriorated, and 13 (45%) had no change. At 3 to 6 months, 20 (74%) of 27 patients were improved, seven (26%) had no change, and none deteriorated. Of patients with successful CTEA, 23 (96%) of 24 had a patent ICA on follow-up duplex scan evaluation, and there was no evidence of recurrent ipsilateral neurologic events at an average of 49 months.\nThese data support an aggressive early surgical intervention for acute ICA thrombosis in carefully selected patients. In the previous decade we reported a 46% success rate for establishing antegrade flow in the ICA long term. Data from this decade show a 79% (P =.0114) success rate for establishing antegrade flow long term in all patients undergoing emergency CTEA. New and improved imaging modalities have allowed better patient selection, resulting in improved outcomes.",

    "results": "Twenty-nine patients underwent emergency ipsilateral CTEA for acute ICA thrombosis over the last 10 years. The average age of the patients was 69.9 +/- 1.7 years, and 66% were men. Patient risk factors included diabetes (7 [24%]), hypertension (21 [72%]), coronary artery disease (8 [29%]), and history of tobacco abuse (20 [69%]). Presenting symptoms included cerebrovascular accident (7 [24%]), transient ischemic attack (nonamaurosis) (10 [34%]), crescendo transient ischemic attack (7 [24%]), stroke in evolution (2 [7%]), and amaurosis fugax (3 [10%]). Diagnostic evaluation included computed tomographic scan (29 [100%]), magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography (4 [14%]), duplex scan evaluation of the carotid arteries (23 [79%]), and cerebral angiography (18 [64%]). Antegrade flow in the ICA was successfully established in 24 (83%) of 29 patients and confirmed with intraoperative angiography or duplex sonography. Postoperative morbidity included 2 hematomas (7%), 4 transient cranial nerve deficits (14%), and 1 conversion to hemorrhagic stroke (3.6%), which resulted in the only death (3.6%). MRS scores averaged 3.4 +/- 0.2 preoperatively. Follow-up averaging 74.1 +/- 21 months (range, 3-140 months) was obtained in 27 (93%) patients. Improvement or deterioration was defined as a change in MRS +/- 1. Immediately postoperatively, 14 (48%) patients were improved, 2 (7%) deteriorated, and 13 (45%) had no change. At 3 to 6 months, 20 (74%) of 27 patients were improved, seven (26%) had no change, and none deteriorated. Of patients with successful CTEA, 23 (96%) of 24 had a patent ICA on follow-up duplex scan evaluation, and there was no evidence of recurrent ipsilateral neurologic events at an average of 49 months.",

    "abstract": "Although the results of the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study clearly demonstrated the benefit of surgical over medical management of severe carotid artery stenosis, the results for women in particular were less certain. This was to some extent because of the higher perioperative complication rate observed in the 281 women (3.6% vs 1.7% in men). The objective of this study was to review a large experience with carotid endarterectomy in female patients and to determine whether the perioperative results differed from those of male patients.\nA review was conducted of a prospectively compiled database on all carotid endarterectomies performed between 1982 and 1997. Operations performed in 991 female patients were compared with those performed in 1485 male patients.\nFemale patients had a significantly lower incidence of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and contralateral carotid artery occlusion than did male patients. Female patients had a significantly higher incidence of hypertension. There were no significant differences in the age, smoking history, anesthetic route, shunt use, or clamp tolerance between the two groups. Of 991 female patients, 659 (66.5%) had preoperative symptoms, whereas 332 (33.5%) cases were performed for asymptomatic stenosis. Among 1485 male patients, 1041 (70.1%) had symptoms, and 444 (29.9%) were symptom free before surgery. There were no significant differences noted in the perioperative stroke rates between men and women overall (2.3% vs 2.4%, P =.92), or when divided into symptomatic (2.5% vs 3.0%, P =.52) and asymptomatic (2.0% vs 1.2%, P =.55) cases.\nCarotid endarterectomy can be performed with equally low perioperative stroke rates in men and women in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. In this series, symptom-free female patients had the lowest overall stroke rate. The concerns of the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study regarding the benefit of carotid endarterectomy in female patients should therefore not prevent clinicians from recommending and performing carotid endarterectomy in appropriately selected symptom-free female patients.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe variation in utilization, care processes, and outcomes for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) procedures in 10 states.\nWe reviewed the medical records of Medicare patients who underwent 10,561 CEA procedures between June 1, 1995, and May 31, 1996, in 10 different states to determine indications, care processes, and outcomes. This study also included medical record review of hospital readmissions within 30 days of the procedure and identification of out-of-hospital deaths from the Medicare beneficiary files.\nUtilization rates of CEA varied from 25.7 to 38.4 procedures per 10,000 Medicare beneficiaries among states. The overall combined event rate (30-day stroke or mortality) was 5.2% for primary CEA alone (n = 9945). The mortality rate was 1.5%, and the nonfatal stroke rate was 3.7%. Combined event rates (CEA alone) by surgical indication were 7.7% for stroke (n = 1037), 7.4% for transient ischemic attack (n = 1304), 5.3% for nonspecific symptoms (n = 3713), and 3.7% for asymptomatic patients (n = 3891). The combined event rates (CEA alone) among states ranged from 4.1% to 7.7% with the event rates in asymptomatic patients ranging from 2.3% to 6.7%. In a multivariate analysis (correcting for indication), the use of preoperative antiplatelet agents (odds ratio [OR], 0.70), intraoperative heparin (OR, 0.49), and patch angioplasty (OR, 0.73) was significantly associated with lower combined event rates. There were significant differences among states in the use of preoperative antiplatelet therapy (range, 56%-70%) and patch angioplasty (range, 11%-49%). Combined event rates for repeat procedures (n = 380) and CEA combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 236) were 6.3% and 17.4%, respectively.\nThe striking variation among states suggests that there is room for improvement in the utilization, care processes, and outcomes of CEA. All surgeons performing CEA should participate in outcome assessment and adopt protocols that include the routine administration of antiplatelet agents preoperatively, the use of heparin intraoperatively, and patch angioplasty of the endarterectomy site.",

    "abstract": "Carotid angioplasty-stenting (CAS) has been advocated as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with restenotic lesions after prior CEA, primary stenoses with significant medical comorbidities, and radiation-induced stenoses. The incidence of restenosis after CAS and its management remains ill defined. We evaluated the incidence and management of in-stent restenosis after CAS.\nPatients with asymptomatic (61%) and symptomatic (39%) carotid stenosis of > or = 80% underwent CAS between September 1996 and May 2000; there were 50 procedures and 46 patients (26 men and 20 women). All patients were followed up clinically and underwent duplex ultrasonography (DU) at 3- to 6-month intervals. In-stent restenoses > or = 80% detected with DU were further evaluated by means of angiography for confirmation of the severity of stenosis.\nNo periprocedural or late strokes occurred in the 50 CAS procedures during the 30-day follow-up period. One death (2.2%) that resulted from myocardial infarction was observed 10 days after discharge following CAS. During a mean follow-up period of 18 +/- 10 months (range, 1-44 months), in-stent restenosis was observed after four (8%) of the 50 CAS procedures. Angiography confirmed these high-grade (> or = 80%) in-stent restenoses, which were successfully treated with balloon angioplasty (3) or angioplasty and restenting (1). No periprocedural complications occurred, and these patients remained asymptomatic and without recurrent restenosis over a mean follow-up time of 10 +/- 6 months.\nWe recommend CAS for post-CEA restenosis, primary stenoses in patients with high-risk medical comorbidities, and radiation-induced stenoses. In-stent restenoses occurred after 8% of CAS procedures and were managed without complications with repeat angioplasty or repeat angioplasty and restenting.",

    "abstract": "Endograft treatment of aortic aneurysms has become a common procedure in many centers. However, not all patients are candidates for this new technology, because of their vascular anatomy and device limitations. One common problem is iliofemoral occlusive disease, which when present, even in a moderate degree, may preclude introduction of the large-diameter delivery devices currently in use. We present a case of a high-risk male patient with a thoracic aortic aneurysm and severe occlusive disease of the iliac arteries. An alternative approach for device delivery through the carotid artery was used and the procedure was successful with no neurologic complications. We recommend this technique for highly selected patients with an aneurysm who can undergo tube endograft repair without feasible access through the iliac or femoral arteries.",

    "abstract": "Allergic reactions to contrast media, preexisting renal dysfunction, and hyperthyroidism are relative contraindications for angiography with conventional contrast medium. Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) angiography is an alternative method in high-risk patients because CO(2) is nontoxic, without allergic potential, and not iodic. CO(2)-related complications are extremely rare. Because renal insufficiency often occurs in vascular patients, this method will become increasingly important for endovascular surgery. We report on three consecutive patients with asymptomatic infrarenal aortic aneurysm and concomitant renal dysfunction or allergic reactions to standard contrast media. Aortic stent grafts were deployed under CO(2) angiographic control without complications or worsening of renal function.",

We diagnosed a fistula that resulted from a right nephrectomy and subsequent radiotherapy for a urothelial tumor 20 months earlier. The second patient, a 60-year-old woman, complained of right abdominal pain. A duodenocaval fistula that was caused by duodenal perforation by a migrating caval filter placed 10 years earlier was revealed by means of endoscopy. Both patients had a successful operation to treat the condition. An extensive review of the literature disclosed 35 other cases and identified two factors of good prognosis: duodenocaval fistulas caused by migrating caval filters and early surgery.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in children and young adults are rare; some have been observed in patients with tuberous sclerosis (TS). We report two cases and review the literature. A 9-year-old girl with TS was diagnosed with a 3-cm calcified AAA, and a 41-year-old man with TS was diagnosed with a 7.5-cm thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA). Both patients underwent open repair with a tube polyester graft without complication. They are both doing well at 7 and 8 years after surgery. Pathologic evaluation revealed medial atrophy and focal medial disruption in the aortic wall in both patients. With our two cases, 15 patients with TS and aneurysms have been reported; 12 had AAA, and four had TAA (one patient had both). Three AAAs and two TAAs ruptured. Six patients died because of aneurysmal disease. There is an association between TS and aortic aneurysms. Patients should be screened for aortic aneurysms at the time TS is diagnosed and annually thereafter. Because of the high risk of rupture, early elective repair is suggested. New aortic aneurysms after repair may also develop.",

    "abstract": "The ideal small-caliber arterial graft remains elusive despite several decades of intense research. A novel approach to the development of small-caliber arterial prostheses with a biomimetic system for in vitro vessel culture has recently been described. In this study we examined the effects of culture time and tissue culture scaffolding on engineered vessel morphology and function and found that these parameters greatly influence the function of engineered vessels.\nThis report describes the effects of culture time and scaffold type on vessel morphology, cellular differentiation, and vessel mechanical characteristics. Engineered vessels were cultured from bovine aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells that were seeded onto biodegradable polymer scaffolds and cultured under physiologically pulsatile conditions. Engineered vessels were subjected to histologic, ultrastructural, immunocytochemical, and mechanical analyses.\nVessel morphology and mechanical characteristics improved as time in culture increased to 8 weeks. SMCs in the engineered vessel wall were organized into a highly lamellar structure, with cells separated by alternating layers of collagen fibrils. Polymer scaffold remnants were present in vessels cultured for 8 weeks, and SMCs that were in proximity to polymer remnants exhibited a dedifferentiated phenotype.\nThese findings aid in the systematic understanding of the effects of in vitro parameters on engineered vessels and will be useful for the translation of vessel culture techniques to human cells for the development of autologous human vascular grafts.",

In this model, a porcine model of deep venous thrombosis with a novel endovascular technique was described, and the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy with urokinase was evaluated.\nAn endovascular device that consisted of a tapered polytetrafluoroethylene graft attached within a self-expanding nitinol stent was delivered to bilateral common iliac veins in 20 pigs. Venous thrombosis occurred as a result of flow stasis created by the intrastent stenosis. Catheter-directed pulse-spray thrombolysis with urokinase (250,000 units) and heparin (5000 IU) was performed on one limb while the contralateral limb received control saline solution. Thrombolysis was performed in 1 hour (n = 4), 8 hours (n = 4), 3 days (n = 4), 7 days (n = 4), and 14 days (n = 4) after the stent-graft deployment. Venography and intravascular ultrasound were used to evaluate the efficacy of thrombolysis. Light microscopy was used for histologic analysis of the thrombus.\nComplete thrombolysis was achieved in groups with deep vein thrombosis that were younger than 1 day. Angioplasty of the tapered stent-grafts in the completely thrombolysed iliac vein was successful in restoring venous flow. The efficacy of thrombolysis in 3-day, 7-day, and 14-day groups was 86% +/- 7%, 73% +/- 13%, and 42% +/- 23%, respectively. The thrombolytic efficacy was enhanced to 92% +/- 16% and 86% +/- 18% (P <.05) in 3-day and 7-day groups, respectively, when doses of the pulse-spray thrombolysis were doubled. Increased dosages of the thrombolytic agent, however, did not significantly enhance the thrombus dissolution in the 14-day group.\nThe thrombolytic efficacy of urokinase correlated with the chronicity of deep venous thrombosis in our model. An increased dose of urokinase may be used to enhance the efficacy of thrombolysis in a 1-week-old thrombus.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic plaque instability may be a contributing factor to plaque complications, such as rupture, thrombosis, and embolization. Of the two types of plaques, atheromatous and fibrous, the atheromatous type has been reported to be vulnerable and unstable. This instability may be related to changes in the cell cycle and extracellular matrix degradation. Apoptosis may weaken the plaque structurally. In addition, alteration of the cellular component may lead to imbalances in associated proteolytic activity. Our study was designed to compare the two types of plaques in terms of apoptosis, apoptosis-inducing factors, namely Fas/CD95/APO-1 and CPP-32/YAMA/caspase-3, and proteolytic activity.\nCarotid artery plaques were obtained from patients undergoing endarterectomy and were classified as either atheromatous or fibrous on the basis of established criteria. Histologic study included hematoxylin and eosin staining, Verhoeff's van Gieson elastin staining, and trichrome staining. Detection of apoptosis was performed with the TUNEL assay. Immunohistochemical studies were performed to localize the expression of CPP-32/YAMA and Fas/CD95. Gelatin gel zymography was used to compare proteolytic activity levels in the two types of plaque.\nApoptosis was significantly higher (P <.001) in atheromatous plaques (4.90% +/- 1.27% [SEM]) as compared with fibrous plaques (0.86% +/- 0.46% [SEM]). Zymography demonstrated elevated levels of proteinases in atheromatous plaques. Immunohistochemistry revealed significant increases in the expression of Fas/CD95 (P <.04) and CPP-32/YAMA (P <.001) in atheromatous plaques as compared with that in fibrous plaques.\nThis is the first study comparing molecular factors that render atheromatous plaques more susceptible to rupture than fibrous plaques. The higher number of apoptotic cells seen in atheromatous plaques as compared with fibrous plaques could contribute to their greater instability. Immunoreactivity to cytoplasmic death domain, Fas/CD95 and CPP-32/YAMA, a prominent mediator of apoptosis, was consistent with the numbers of apoptotic cells detected. The increased levels of proteolytic activity in atheromatous plaques may make these plaques more prone to rupture. These data identifying some of the molecular events and biochemical pathways associated with plaque vulnerability may help in the development of new strategies to prevent plaque rupture.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the administration of 40% supplemental oxygen (O ( 2) ) will decrease cellular proliferation and intimal hyperplasia (IH) at a prosthetic vascular graft (PVG)-to-artery anastomosis.\nTwenty New Zealand white rabbits underwent placement of a 3-mm polytetrafluoroethylene graft in their infrarenal aorta. Four groups of five rabbits were placed either in a normoxic (21%) environment or in a 40% supplemental O ( 2) environment for 7 or 42 days. Twenty-four hours before the rabbits were humanely killed for aortic graft harvest, BrDU (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine) was injected into the rabbits intraperitoneally. Image analysis (Bioquant) morphometrics were used to measure cells with BrDU staining and intimal areas at the distal anastomosis. Cellular proliferation is defined as positively staining BrDU cells divided by all cells in the artery wall. IH is reported as a ratio between the intimal area and the medial area to standardize the varying aortic size and degree of aortic fixation among rabbits. The Student t test was used to compare cellular proliferation and IH between control and O ( 2) -treated rabbits.\nCellular proliferation in the intima at 7 days was significantly reduced in the O ( 2) -treated animals (1.7% +/- 1%) versus the control animals (28.6% +/- 3%) ( P =.0001). The cellular proliferation in the intima at 42 days returned to preoperative levels in the O ( 2) -treated group (0.15%) and in the control group (0.11%) ( P = not significant). IH at 7 days was minimal, and no difference between the O ( 2) -treated group (0.017 +/-.006) and the control group (0.009 +/-.03) ( P = not significant) was found.

    "abstract": "Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) experience progressive macrovascular atherosclerosis and intimal hyperplastic restenosis with increased frequency as compared with nondiabetic patients. These observations suggest that vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) behave in a phenotypically different and more aggressive manner in diabetic patients. In this study, we compared the in vitro rates of proliferation, adhesion, and migration of human VSMCs obtained from diabetic and nondiabetic patients.\nHuman VSMC cultures were isolated from 23 diabetic patients (9 artery, 14 vein) and 15 nondiabetic patients (9 artery, 6 vein) with extensive lower extremity atherosclerosis. All patients were between 61 and 78 years of age (average: 68.4 years [diabetic]; 67.3 years [nondiabetic]). All diabetic patients had type 2 DM. Vascular specimens were obtained at the time of amputation from infragenicular arteries and during arterial revascularization from saphenous veins. Cells from passages 2 and 3 were assayed for their proliferative capacity with total DNA fluorescence photometry and for adhesion and migration with a modified Boyden chamber.\nThe average duration of diabetes was 11.6 +/- 4.1 years. The average number of diabetic complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, coronary artery disease) was 2.8 +/- 0.7 per patient. Diabetic VSMCs exhibited abnormal morphology in cell culture with loss of the normal hill and valley configuration. Proliferation was significantly increased in VSMCs of diabetic origin (156 +/- 57 absorption units) as compared with those of nondiabetic origin (116 +/- 42 absorption units) (P <.001). Diabetic VSMCs demonstrated significantly greater adhesion (63.6 +/- 24 per high-power field vs 37.9 +/- 13 per high-power field; P =.002) and migration (397 +/- 151 per low-power field vs 121 +/- 99 per low-power field; P =.001) rates.\nDiabetic VSMCs exhibit significantly increased rates of proliferation, adhesion, and migration as well as abnormal cell culture morphology suggestive of abnormal contact inhibition. These observations of human VSMCs in culture are consistent with the increased rate of infragenicular atherosclerosis and the increased rates of restenosis observed clinically in diabetic patients. The atherosclerosis- and intimal hyperplasia-promoting behavior exhibited appears to be intrinsic to the DM-VSMC phenotype and must be considered when designing methods to limit atherosclerosis and intimal hyperplasia in diabetic patients.",

    "abstract": "Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), an acute-phase reactant implicated in vascular disease, is a 420-kd multifunctional glycoprotein chemotactic for vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). TSP-1 has six domains of repeating homologous amino acid sequences: N-terminal, procollagen homology, type 1 repeat, type 2 repeat, type 3 repeat/RGD (T3), and C-terminal (COOH). The purpose of this experiment was to determine which domains of TSP-1 induce VSMC chemotaxis.\nA modified Boyden Chamber chemotaxis assay was used to assess VSMC migration. Serum-free medium, TSP-1, or each of the fusion proteins (10 and 20 microg/mL) synthesized for the different domains were placed in the bottom wells. Quiescent bovine aortic VSMCs (50,000) were placed in the top wells. After 4 hours at 37 degrees C, migrated VSMCs were recorded as cells per five fields (400x) and analyzed with the paired t test. To verify the fusion protein data, we performed chemotaxis assays with antibodies to each of the domains (25 microg/mL) combined with TSP-1 (20 microg/mL) in the bottom wells and VSMCs in the top wells.\nThe COOH domain significantly stimulated VSMC chemotaxis (P = <.001). To a lesser extent, the N-terminal and T3 domains also induced chemotaxis (P <.05). However, only the anti-COOH antibody (C6.7) and the anti-integrin-associated protein portion of COOH antibody (D4.6) significantly inhibited TSP-1-induced VSMC chemotaxis (by 85% and 92%, respectively).\nThese results implicate the COOH domain as the portion of the TSP-1 molecule primarily responsible for VSMC chemotaxis. This experiment suggests that future strategies in the prevention of VSMC migration, an initial step in the development of vascular lesions, may involve selective inhibition of the COOH domain of TSP-1.",

    "abstract": "Heparin binds to human platelets and can cause activation and aggregation, although the mechanisms are unknown. To determine how heparin alters platelet function, we identified platelet-binding sites for heparin and measured heparin's influence on the function of platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa).\nPhotoaffinity cross-linking and affinity chromatography experiments were performed to identify platelet membrane proteins that bind heparin. Heparin's effect on fibrinogen binding to platelets was measured with a radioligand-binding assay. The translocation to the cytoskeleton of Rap2, a guanosine triphosphate-binding protein, was measured from platelets aggregating in response to heparin and other agonists.\nCross-linking and affinity chromatographic experiments positively identified the integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) as a heparin-binding site. Heparin aggregation was calcium dependent. Low concentrations of unfractionated porcine mucosal heparin (2-5 U/mL) significantly increased fibrinogen I 125 binding to activated platelets, whereas higher doses did not. Heparin-mediated platelet aggregation was completely blocked by GRGDS peptide (5 mmol/L), a competitive inhibitor of fibrinogen binding, and was blocked by EDTA (2 mmol/L), which dissociates the functional integrin complex. Aggregation was associated with Rap2 translocation to the cytoskeleton, a sign of outside-in signaling.\nHeparin binds to the alpha(IIb)beta(3) integrin in vitro and ex vivo, and heparin increases fibrinogen binding to the integrin. Heparin-mediated aggregation requires an intact integrin and ligand and leads to Rap2 translocation to the cytoskeleton-an outside-in signal of ligand engagement. Heparin may directly modulate platelet integrin function, most likely through direct binding and modulation of integrin function.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO), frequently cited for its protective role, can also generate toxic metabolites known to degrade elastin. Both abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are associated with inflammatory states, yet the relationship between NO production by iNOS and AAA development is unknown. The current study examines iNOS expression, NO production, and the effects of selective inhibition of iNOS by aminoguanidine in experimental AAA.\nAn intra-aortic elastase infusion model was used. Control rats received intra-aortic saline infusion and postoperative intraperitoneal saline injections (Group 1). In the remaining groups, intra-aortic elastase infusion was used to induce aneurysm formation. These rats were treated with intraperitoneal injections of saline postoperatively (Group 2), aminoguanidine postoperatively (Group 3), or aminoguanidine preoperatively and postoperatively (Group 4). Aortic diameter and plasma nitrite/nitrate levels were measured on the day of surgery and postoperative day 7. Aortas were harvested for biochemical and histologic analysis on postoperative day 7.\nInfusion of elastase produced AAAs (P <.001) with significant production of iNOS (P <.05) and nitrite/nitrate (P <.003) compared with controls. Selective inhibition of iNOS with aminoguanidine in elastase-infused aortas significantly reduced aneurysm size (P <.01) compared with elastase infusion alone. Aminoguanidine-treated rats displayed suppression of iNOS expression and plasma nitrite/nitrate production not significantly different from the control group. Histologic evaluation revealed equivalent inflammatory infiltrates in elastase-infused groups.\nExpression of iNOS is induced and plasma nitrite/nitrate levels are increased in experimental AAA. Inhibition of iNOS limits NO production and iNOS expression, resulting in smaller aneurysm size. NO production by iNOS plays an important role with detrimental effects during experimental aneurysm development.",

    "abstract": "The molecular basis of vascular response to hypertension is largely unknown. Both cellular and extracellular components are critical. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that there is a balance between vascular cell proliferation and cell death during vessel remodeling in response to hypertension.\nA midthoracic aortic coarctation was created in rats to induce an elevation of blood pressure proximal to the coarctation. The time course was 1 and 3 days and 1, 2, and 4 weeks for the study of the proximal aorta. Ribonuclease protection assay and Western blot analysis were used to evaluate gene expression of growth and apoptosis-related cytokines with two sets of multiple probes, rCK-3 and rAPO-1. Cell proliferation was determined with BrdU (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine) incorporation. Apoptosis was examined with TUNEL (transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling). Morphometry was performed on histologic sections.\nCoarctation produced hypertension in the proximal aorta, 118 +/- 9 mm Hg versus 94 +/- 6 mm Hg in controls (P <.002). Both messenger RNA and protein levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and TGF-beta3 were increased (P <.005 vs controls). Messenger RNA and protein of Bcl-xS and Fas ligand, known as proapoptotic factors, were both reduced after coarctation (P <.005 vs controls). There was increased BrdU incorporation at 3 days and 1 and 2 weeks (P <.001 vs controls). There were no remarkable changes in the apoptosis rate until 4 weeks later.\nCell proliferation was stimulated at 3 days, and apoptosis was halted until 4 weeks. These changes were associated with upregulation of TGF-beta and downregulation of Bcl-xS and Fas ligand gene expression. These findings suggest that a coordinated regulation of cell proliferation and cell death contributes to arterial remodeling in response to acute sustained elevation of blood pressure. Cell proliferation precedes apoptosis by 2 weeks in this procedure.",

    "abstract": "The events preceding myointimal thickening in vein grafts after vascular reconstructions are not well characterized. Indeed, the injury response associated with vein graft arterialization may be different than that observed in the balloon angioplasty model. Therefore, we used a rat model to study the early cellular response after arterialization of vein grafts.\nEpigastric veins were placed as femoral artery interposition grafts in 37 male Lewis rats (weight range, 350-400 g). Vein grafts and contralateral epigastric veins were harvested at different time points (6 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, 30 days, and 70 days). Tissue specimens were processed for histology and immunohistochemistry with antibodies for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and for different cell types. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used as a means of determining the presence of apoptosis. Electron microscopy was used as means of assessing the integrity of the endothelial cell surface (SEM) and confirming the presence of apoptosis (TEM). Specimens were also snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation and molecular analysis.\nAt 1 day, endothelial denudation with platelet deposition on the surface was shown by means of SEM. Both apoptosis and necrosis of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were present in the media, along with monocyte infiltration. Cellular proliferation and apoptosis were most intense within the first week of implantation. PCNA staining was first seen in the adventitial fibroblasts and microvessels, then in the medial SMCs at 3 days. With reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) messenger RNA (mRNA) was noted at 1 day. Myointimal thickening progressively developed, with no apparent diminution of the luminal area as long as 70 days after implantation. By means of the analysis of the transforming growth factor beta1, mRNA showed expression during intimal thickening and accumulation of extracellular matrix. Reendothelialization was complete at 30 days.\nThese observations indicate that the cellular composition in our vein graft model is similar to human stenotic explants. Endothelial denudation is observed in rat vein grafts with complete regeneration by 30 days. VEGF mRNA is upregulated at 1 day, followed by proliferation of microvessel endothelial cells in the adventitia. Cellular proliferation and apoptosis are minimal after 21 days, with progressive intimal thickening likely to be the result of matrix accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular tissue engineering approaches to vessel wall restoration have focused on the potent but relatively nonspecific and heparin-dependent mesenchymal cell mitogen fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1). We hypothesized that linking FGF-1 to a sequence likely to bind to cell surface receptors relatively more abundant on endothelial cells (ECs) might induce a relative greater EC bioavailability of the FGF-1. We constructed a heparin-binding growth-associated molecule (HB-GAM)/FGF-1 chimera by linking full-length human HB-GAM to the amino-terminus of human FGF-1beta (21-154) and tested its activities on smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and ECs.\nPrimary canine carotid SMCs and jugular vein ECs were plated in 96-well plates in media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and grown to approximately 80% confluence. After being growth arrested in serum-free media for 24 hours, the cells were exposed to concentration ranges of cytokines and heparin, and proliferation was measured with tritiated-thymidine incorporation. Twenty percent fetal bovine serum was used as positive control, and phosphate-buffered saline was used as negative control.\nIn the presence of heparin the HB-GAM/FGF-1 chimera stimulated less SMC proliferation than did the wild-type FGF-1 with a median effective dose of approximately 0.3 nmol versus approximately 0.1 nmol (P <.001). By contrast, the chimera retained full stimulating activity on EC proliferation with a median effective dose of 0.06 nmol for both cytokines. Unlike the wild-type protein, the chimera possessed heparin-independent activity. In the absence of heparin, the chimera induced dose-dependent EC and SMC proliferation at 0.06 nmol or more compared with the wild-type FGF-1, which stimulated minimal DNA synthesis at 6.0-nmol concentrations.\nThe HB-GAM/FGF-1 chimera displays significantly greater and uniquely heparin-independent mitogenic activity for both cell types, and in the presence of heparin it displays a significantly greater EC specificity.",

The utility of transfer function index (TFI) of pulse volume recordings is tested for this purpose.\nThe design of the study was a blind comparative study that involved 70 testing procedures that were performed on 58 different infrainguinal vein bypass grafts. The TFI was measured with a portable vascular laboratory multi-cuff unit. Ankle/brachial indexes were obtained with the same device. Color flow duplex scanning was used as a diagnostic standard. A graft was defined as at risk, according to duplex scanning, if a local stenosis with a V2/V1 more than 2 was found or if peak systolic velocity remained less than 45 cm/s throughout the graft. The repeatability of the method was tested on 30 grafts.\nA total of 63 tests were available for analysis. Seven tests were excluded. Four were excluded because they had unreliable TFI measurement due to cardiac arrhythmias, and in three tests, the whole graft could not be visualized in the duplex scan. Forty normal and 22 at-risk grafts were found. One graft was occluded. The TFI was significantly lower for at-risk grafts (0.89) versus normal grafts (1.09; P =.005). A TFI of 1.02 or less correctly detected 21 of 22 at-risk grafts. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 96%, 65%, and 76%, respectively. The ability of the ankle/brachial index to detect the at-risk grafts was clearly inferior to the TFI. The repeatability of the method at proximal thigh, distal thigh, and proximal calf was +/- 0.21, +/- 0.07, and +/- 0.14, respectively.\nThe TFI is a sensitive and reliable method to detect an at-risk graft. The examination is noninvasive, simple, quick to perform, and well tolerated by the patients. We suggest that the TFI could be the first-line screening method in vein graft surveillance.",

    "abstract": "The interobserver variability of aortoiliac and femoropopliteal duplex scanning in peripheral arterial occlusive disease was assessed.\nTwo experienced, independent vascular technologists investigated in random order 61 consecutive patients sent to the vascular laboratory for investigation of the aortoiliac or femoropopliteal arteries. In each aortoiliac vessel segment, the proximal, mid, and distal peak systolic velocities (PSVs) were measured, and corresponding PSV ratios were calculated. The superficial femoral artery was divided in 10-cm segments with a roll-centimeter taped from the upper patella margin. Interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated as a means of appreciating the measurement variability of the PSV ratio values as a continuous variable and the Kappa value for the PSV ratio categories of less than 2.0, 2.0 through 3.0, more than 3.0, and occlusions.\nThe overall ICC and Kappa values were 0.72 (95% CI, 0.63-0.79) and 0.53 for the aortoiliac tract and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.79-0.89) and 0.73 for the femoropopliteal tract. Agreement in the PSV ratio categories was 85% in the aortoiliac and 87% in the femoropopliteal tract. Interobserver variation increased markedly with increasing PSV ratio. In the PSV ratio category between 2.0 to 3.0, indicating a borderline stenosis, a substantial disagreement was found (aortoiliac, 1 of 8 agreement; femoropopliteal, 2 of 8 agreement).\nA moderate interobserver agreement was found in the duplex investigation of the aortoiliac and femoropopliteal arteries. One should be aware of this in clinical decision making, especially in cases of borderline stenoses. In these cases, repetition of the measurement or additional diagnostics is advocated.",

    "abstract": "Dacron (polyester fiber) was largely abandoned for femoropopliteal bypass grafts 30 years ago because saphenous vein achieved better patencies. However, in patients taking aspirin, patency in above-knee femoropopliteal bypass grafts has recently been shown to be equivalent to that with saphenous vein. We compared heparin-bonded Dacron (HBD) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in a randomized multicenter trial including below-knee popliteal or tibioperoneal trunk bypass graft where the long saphenous vein was absent or inadequate.\nOver 28 months, 209 patients undergoing femoropopliteal bypass grafts (180 above-knee, 29 below-knee) were randomized to HBD (n = 106) or PTFE (n = 103). Each patient was given aspirin (300 mg/d) before surgery, and this continued unless the patient had intolerance to the aspirin.\nThe mean follow-up was 42 months (range, 28-55). Fifteen (7.1%) patients died with patent grafts, and three (1.4%) infected grafts were removed. Patency (measured with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis) at 1, 2, and 3 years for HBD was 70%, 63%, and 55% compared with 56%, 46%, and 42%, respectively, for PTFE (P =.044). A total of 67 secondary interventions were performed on 48 thrombosed grafts; long-term patency was achieved in only three. Risk factors for arterial disease did not significantly influence patency.

    "abstract": "When autogenous vein is unavailable, cryopreserved veins have been used in patients as a means of attempted limb salvage. We evaluated the long-term patency and limb salvage rates for patients undergoing bypass grafting with cryopreserved veins.\nMedical records were reviewed for patients undergoing cryovein bypass grafting at two hospitals from 1992 to 1997. Follow-up data were obtained from subsequent admissions and office records. Primary outcomes were death, amputation, and primary patency. Skin integrity and additional bypass grafting procedures were assessed when data were available. Analysis was performed by means of life-table and chi(2) analyses with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS).\nSeventy-six patients (mean age, 70 +/- 11 years) underwent 80 procedures. Indications for surgery were tissue loss (63%), rest pain (24%), acute ischemia (11%), and other (2%). Early complications included 3 deaths (4%), 14 acute thromboses (18%), and 7 major amputations (9%). The mean follow-up period was 17.8 +/- 20.89 months (range, 0-77 months). The primary patency rate was determined to be 36.8% at 1 year and 23.6% at 3 years by means of life-table analysis. The limb salvage rate was 65.5% at 1 year and 62.3% at 3 years. Skin integrity was found to be compromised in 17 (55%) of 31 patients who were available to follow-up. Nine patients (11.3%) underwent additional ipsilateral revascularization or revisions, with one of three of these patients eventually requiring a major amputation.\nCryopreserved vein may be a reasonable alternative conduit for limb salvage when no autogenous tissue is available; it has an acceptable limb salvage rate (62.3%) at 3 years. Long-term patency remains relatively poor, with only 23.6% of originally placed grafts patent at 3 years. The use of cryopreserved veins should be strictly confined to limb salvage after a thorough search for autogenous tissue has been exhausted.",

INR-specific incidence rates of ischemic and hemorrhagic events were calculated as the ratio of the number of events at a certain INR category and the total patient-time spent in that class. The relationship between INR class and event rates was quantified by rate ratios calculated in a Poisson regression model.\nIn 1326 patients (mean age, 69 years) 41,928 INR measurements were recorded in 1698 patient-years. Patients spent 50% of the total time within the target range of 3.0 to 4.5 INR. Most of the patient-time (60%) was spent between 2.5 and 3.5 INR. For each increasing class of 0.5 INR, the incidence of ischemic events (n = 154, INR data on event available in 49%) decreased by a factor of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.87-1.08).

CT was repeated at 30 days to study evolution of these clinically occult PTE.\nWe observed silent PTE in 65 patients (41%) in all levels of lower limb venous thrombosis. Prevalence of PTE showed significant association with male sex (P =.001) and previously diagnosed heart disease (P =.023). There was no significant association between the level of DVT and the presence of PTE nor the DVT side and thromboembolic pulmonary localization. Of the 65 patients with positive CT exploration results for PTE, 52 had characteristics of acute PTE, 10 had chronic PTE, and 3 patients had both. Chronic PTE was found more frequently in patients with previous episodes of DVT (P =.024). A total of 165 pulmonary artery-affected segments were found at several locations: 5 main, 35 lobar, 58 interlobar, and 67 segmental. Multiple segments were affected in 59% of patients. Repeat CT examinations were performed at 30 days in 53 of 65 patients with positive CT scanning results. In 48 cases (90.6%) PTE had completely disappeared.\nSilent PTE occurred frequently in association with clots of lower limbs. The CT scan had a good availability and cost-effectiveness to detect clinically underestimated PTE. The incorporation of this exploration in the systematic diagnostic strategy of most patients with DVT to establish the extension of thromboembolic disease at diagnosis may be useful in the evaluation of added pulmonary artery symptoms and treatment strategies.",

A total of 165 pulmonary artery-affected segments were found at several locations: 5 main, 35 lobar, 58 interlobar, and 67 segmental. Multiple segments were affected in 59% of patients. Repeat CT examinations were performed at 30 days in 53 of 65 patients with positive CT scanning results. In 48 cases (90.6%) PTE had completely disappeared.",

    "abstract": "Patients with venous thromboembolic disease are treated with anticoagulation or vena cava filter placement to prevent pulmonary embolism. A recent report suggested that filter placement may increase the risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and prompted a review of our experience.\nProspectively collected data on 2109 consecutive patients receiving filters were evaluated for recurrent thromboembolism, vena cava occlusion, or venous stasis ulceration. Outcomes were stratified and analyzed according to the use of anticoagulants at the time of insertion and at follow-up. Incidence rates were also compared with reports in the literature.\nOf 1191 patients with DVT at filter placement, complete follow-up data at a mean of 9 years were available for 465. Recurrent DVT was found in 12% of the 241 patients who were given anticoagulants and 15% of the 224 who were not (P >.05). We also failed to find a significant association between the use of anticoagulation and the incidence of pulmonary embolism (2%), stasis ulceration (2%), and vena cava occlusion (0.0).\nRecurrent DVT in patients with existing thromboembolic disease is not an unexpected event, which, in our experience, is not associated with anticoagulant or filter use. Anticoagulation should be used when possible to treat existing DVT to reduce thrombus progression and potentially to reduce subsequent complications but does not seem to reduce the rate of recurrent DVT. Rates of recurrent thromboembolism were consistently less than the 20% to 50% reported in the literature.",

    "abstract": "The role of percutaneous angioplasty and stenting of carotid bifurcation lesions has been limited by its potential for producing embolic debris. We evaluated the efficacy of a proximal occlusion catheter (POC) in the prevention of embolic events during carotid artery stenting. In addition, pressure measurements relevant to the clinical application of this device were obtained from 10 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.\nThe POC is a guiding catheter with an occlusion balloon attached on the outside of the catheter at its distal end. Occlusion of the common carotid artery (CCA) was achieved by inflating the balloon while access to carotid bifurcation lesions was obtained through the inner lumen. The POC was inserted in the CCA of 10 dogs via the femoral artery. The side port of the POC was connected to a sheath placed in the femoral vein, thereby creating an external arteriovenous shunt. Ten artificial radiopaque particles simulating embolic particles and contrast agent were introduced in the CCA and monitored fluoroscopically. As a control, the same procedure was performed with a standard guiding catheter without an occlusion balloon. In 10 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, the internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery stump pressures and the pressure in the internal jugular vein were measured.\nWithout the external arteriovenous shunt, in all animals there was prograde flow in the distal CCA despite CCA occlusion. This flow was derived from the thyroid artery. However, once the arteriovenous shunt was activated, reversal of flow in the distal CCA was achieved in each animal, and all the artificial particles were recovered from the side port of the POC. In the control group, each particle embolized to the brain (100%, P <.01). In the patients, the mean stump pressures in the ICA and external carotid artery and the jugular vein pressure were 51.8 +/- 14.2, 62.2 +/- 15.1, and 6.5 +/- 3.5 mm Hg, respectively. In each case, the jugular vein pressure was the lowest among the three.\nObtaining proximal CCA control by inflating the POC does not sufficiently prevent embolization. However, reversal of flow in the ICA can always be created with the external shunt, which effectively prevents embolization. Thus, POC may markedly lower procedural stroke rates during carotid artery stenting. The ability of POC to prevent embolization before crossing the lesion with a guidewire may be an important advantage over other distal protection devices.",

    "abstract": "This is an analysis of the role of primary and secondary carotid artery reconstructions and systemic risk factors on the incidence and timing of reoperations and their perioperative and late outcomes.\nThis is a retrospective analysis of prospectively stored data. Between 1981 and 1999, 69 secondary carotid artery procedures were performed on 66 patients (3 were bilateral). Of these, 29 operations and patients came from my series of 1514 primary carotid endarterectomies (CEAs). Overall, secondary operations were performed on 37 women (1 bilateral) and 29 men (2 bilateral) with a mean age of 68 years. Indications for reoperation were transient ischemic attack in 27%, stroke in 12%, global ischemia in 9%, and asymptomatic > or = 70% recurrent stenosis in 52%. Secondary reconstruction was by saphenous vein patching in 57% (n = 39), Dacron patching in 29% (n = 20), polytetrafluoroethylene patch in 1% (n = 1), and interposition bypass graft in 13% (n = 9). The main outcome measures included restenosis, re-restenosis, and perioperative and late stroke and death.\nReoperations were more frequent after originally primarily closed CEA (6.2%) than after patched CEA (1.6%, P =.01). Reoperations after Dacron-patched CEA occurred at a mean of 16 months compared with a mean of 84 months for vein-patched CEA (P <.001). Male sex and history of smoking have a slightly adverse but not statistically significant effect on the incidence and time of reoperation. Restenosis in the distal common carotid artery requiring reoperation had a near-linear rate of occurrence, whereas that in the internal carotid artery segment was bimodal with a higher incidence in the first 3 years and after 7 years. There were no (0%) 30-day perioperative deaths. There were two (2.9%) 30-day strokes (1 major, 1 minor). Over a mean follow-up of 50 months (range, 1-180), the Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival was 74% at 5 years and 54% at 10 years. This is significantly higher than late death after primary CEA independent of age. The cumulative freedom from stroke rate was 90% at 5 years and 86% at 10 years. After secondary procedures re-recurrent stenosis > or = 25% occurred in 25% (n = 17), > or = 50% in 13% (n = 9), and > or = 70% in 4% (n = 3). There was no statistically significant difference in stroke or re-restenosis rates between vein-patched, Dacron-patched, and bypassed reoperations, although re-recurrence tended to occur earlier after Dacron-patched than vein-patched procedures. Analysis of pooled literature data and the results of this study for stroke and re-restenosis outcomes by type secondary reconstruction (patch versus bypass graft) and by material (vein versus synthetic) give a balanced picture of near equality for each. Vein- and Dacron-patched arteries have similar outcomes, whereas polytetrafluoroethylene appears to be superior to vein and Dacron for interposition bypass graft.\nSecondary carotid artery operations are more frequent after primarily closed CEA than patched CEA. Perioperative mortality and stroke rates for reoperations are within the acceptable window of primary CEA. The incidence of late death after reoperations is higher than after primary CEA. The perioperative stroke, late stroke, and re-restenosis outcomes of vein- and Dacron-patched secondary operations are similar, as are those for patched and bypassed carotid arteries.",

No aneurysms expanded or ruptured during the follow-up period from 6 to 98 months (mean, 26 months). The size of the excluded aneurysm decreased in 22 of 24 aneurysms in the complete group, but no change in size was noted in the six aneurysms in the incomplete group. The preoperative size of the IIA aneurysm in the incomplete group was significantly larger than that in the complete group (P =.0047). The size of two aneurysms in the incomplete group was smaller than 3.0 cm. The aneurysms in the incomplete group extended significantly deep into the pelvis as compared with those in the complete group (P =.0008).\nThe exclusion of IIA aneurysm did not reliably result in thrombosis of the aneurysm. For IIA aneurysms extending deeply into the pelvis, even if the size of the aneurysm is smaller than 3.0 cm, the exclusion procedure should not be performed.",

Between January 1998 and March 2000, 27 patients (23 men; 4 women) with a mean age of 58.2 years (range, 42-76 years) underwent aortoaortic (n = 3), aortounifemoral (n = 4), or aortobifemoral (n = 20) bypass graft for aortoiliac occlusive disease (n = 20), emboligenic aortitis (n = 1), or abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (n = 6). At the beginning of the trial, the decision was made to perform an intraoperative conversion to open surgery in case of bleeding (group 0), when a totally laparoscopic procedure was possible (group I), or when a 6- to 8-cm supraumbilical minilaparotomy was needed in case of technical difficulty (group II). In each case of AAA, the remaining lumbar arteries were controlled (group III); and for the last six patients of this series (group IV), a minilaparotomy was systematically performed.\nOne patient was admitted with multiple organ failure and died on day 12 (3.7%) with a patent graft. One intraoperative conversion to open surgery (3.7%, group 0) was performed for bleeding; recovery was uneventful. Seven postoperative surgical procedures (26%) were necessary, including two cases of aortic bleeding because of hypertensive access. Seven procedures were totally laparoscopic (group I), and a minilaparotomy was performed in the other 19 cases, including seven cases of technical difficulty (group II). The mean operative and clamping times and the mean postoperative hospital stay were globally (P =.021) and individually (P < or =.016) significantly shorter in group IV when compared with those of the other three groups. Twenty patients (74%) had a postoperative hospital stay of 6 days or less (3-6 days), with minimal complaints of pain, tolerance of oral feeding on day 2, and mobilization on day 2 or 3. All bypass grafts remained patent after a mean follow-up of 11 months (1-26 months).\nWith regard to the instrumentation presently available, this study shows the benefit of a minilaparotomy when performing a laparoscopic aortoaortic or aortofemoral bypass graft for the treatment of aortoiliac occlusive disease and AAA.",

    "abstract": "We sought to study the hemostatic profile and the use of blood products in patients undergoing thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.\nThis is a cohort study comparing three groups of patients: 7 undergoing elective acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH); 15 undergoing elective procedures without ANH (non-ANH); and 8 undergoing repair of ruptured thoracoabdominal aneurysms. A control group of 10 patients was used for comparison of preoperative hemostasis. The parameters studied were platelet concentration, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (before and after surgery), packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitates, donor exposure, and use of desmopressin and epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Analysis of variance and multiple stepwise regression analysis were used.\nBefore operation the patients with aneurysms had PTTs prolonged compared with control subjects (P <.05). After operation the ANH group had higher platelet counts than the ruptured group (P =.001) and higher platelet counts (P =.05) and lower PTTs (P =.001) than the non-ANH group. The ANH group was transfused fewer platelets than the non-ANH group (P =.001) and less of every blood product than the ruptured group (P =.05); statistically significant differences were not observed for packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, or platelets. The ANH group was exposed to an average of 65 donors fewer than the ruptured group (P <.001) and 34 fewer than the non-ANH group (P <.05). These differences could not be explained by baseline coagulation status or by the intraoperative use of desmopressin or epsilon-aminocaproic acid.\nThe coagulation abnormality identified before surgery is that of higher PTT values, suggesting a disturbance of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Blood losses, donor exposure, and platelet use were highest in the ruptured group and lowest in the ANH group. After surgery the ruptured group exhibited the worst coagulation parameters, and the ANH group exhibited the best with higher platelet count and lower PTT values than the other groups. The ANH technique appears to be an useful adjunct in the anesthetic management of these patients.",

    "abstract": "Factors influencing the development or rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) have not yet been confirmed. This study delineated the risk factors for rupture of AAAs as evaluated by means of a combination of three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and clinical data analysis.\nThe study population comprised Japanese patients in whom an atherosclerotic AAA had been diagnosed between January 1980 and December 1997. We obtained 3D-based data by means of computer-aided 3D reconstruction from computed tomography studies of AAAs. The data included the tortuosity of the aneurysm, maximum transverse diameter, length of the aneurysm, aneurysmal volume, aneurysmal surface area, largest aneurysmal cross-sectional area, ratio of transverse aneurysmal diameter to the length of the aneurysm (T/L), and amount of mural thrombus. Clinical data were collected from patient files. All data were assessed by means of multivariate analysis for their predictive value for expansion or rupture of AAA.\nThe most efficient predictor of annual expansion rate of maximum transverse diameter (EX-D) was a combination of largest aneurysmal cross-sectional area, tobacco use, and tortuosity. The most efficient predictor of annual expansion rate of aneurysmal volume (EX-V) was a combination of aneurysmal volume and blood urea nitrogen level. The most efficient predictors of aneurysmal rupture was a combination of EX-D, diastolic blood pressure, and T/L.\nThree-dimensional-based data on aneurysmal morphology, including T/L, largest aneurysmal crosssectional area, and aneurysmal volume, had strong predictive value for expansion and rupture of AAAs.",

A retrospective cohort study with linked administrative databases was undertaken.\nThe average 30-day mortality rate was 4.1%. Of the 5878 cases studied, 4415 (75.1%) were performed by 63 vascular surgeons, 1193 (20.3%) by 53 general surgeons, and 270 (4.6%) by 14 cardiac surgeons. After the adjustment for potential confounding factors of annual surgeon AAA volume, type of hospital, and patient age, sex, Charlson comorbidity score, and transfer status, the odds of patients dying were 62% higher when the surgery was performed by a general surgeon than when it was performed by a vascular surgeon. Cardiac surgeons' patient outcomes were similar to those of vascular surgeons.\nPatients who undergo elective AAA repair that is performed by vascular or cardiac surgeons have significantly lower mortality rates than patients who have their aneurysms repaired by general surgeons.

    "abstract": "The medial supragenicular and infragenicular approaches to the popliteal artery were introduced almost 50 years ago and replaced the posterior approach to the popliteal artery for distal graft implantation. We review a contemporary series of bypass grafts to the midpopliteal artery by use of a combined anterior and posterior approach to evaluate its potential clinical benefits.\nAfter the proximal graft anastomosis is constructed, an incision is made in the popliteal fossa to access the midpopliteal artery, the graft is passed into that incision, and all but the popliteal incision is closed. The patient is turned, the midpopliteal artery dissection is completed, and the graft is anastomosed distally.\nFifty-seven bypass grafts, implanted distally on the midpopliteal artery by this technique over a 13-year period, chosen in preference to an infragenicular bypass graft in selected patients when a supragenicular bypass was not feasible, were assessed in terms of indications for surgery, conduit type, complications, length of postoperative hospitalization, and graft patency.\nBypass grafting originated from the axillary artery in two cases, the common iliac artery in one case, and the femoral artery in 54 cases. The procedure was performed in five patients with a popliteal trifurcation anomaly, nine patients with a blind popliteal segment, 20 patients with limited length of autologous vein, and five patients with an above-knee graft infection requiring an alternate path for revascularization. Autologous vein was used in 35 and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in 19 bypass grafts. Three other patients had a composite sequential femoral-popliteal-tibial bypass graft, with PTFE and autologous vein. Postoperative (30 day) complications include one death (composite sequential), one stroke (PTFE), and one graft thrombosis (saphenous vein). The mean postoperative hospitalization for the last 31 patients was 4.2 +/- 3.7 days. In the autologous vein group, the 1-year primary patency rate was 87%, and the primary assisted patency rate was 94%. In the PTFE group, the 1-year primary patency rate was 72%. Two composite sequential grafts remained patent at 1 year.\nBypass grafting to the midpopliteal artery with a combined anterior and posterior approach offers a safe and effective option to below-knee bypass grafting when an above-knee bypass grafting is not feasible. Compared with the medial infragenicular incision, the posterior incision results in reduced morbidity rates, rapid mobilization, and early hospital discharge.",

In the absence of an anastomosis, AEF is likely to be rare after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and has only recently been described in the literature as a result of mechanical stent failure or migration. We present the case of a 61-year-old man who underwent EVAR for an AAA with a \"nonspecific\" periaortic inflammatory mass. Six months postoperatively, an AEF developed, presenting with metastatic sepsis followed by septic infective thromboembolization to his right leg, and amputation was necessary. His stent was well positioned and mechanically intact. We emphasize the need for vigilance about the risk of AEF when adopting an endovascular approach to repair the AAA with a nonspecific periaortic inflammatory mass and highlight the need for awareness about the unusual septic manifestations of AEF.",

    "abstract": "We report three cases of ruptured mycotic thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAS) and a review of the literature. Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2 patients) were the responsible organisms. Surgical management consisted of wide debridement of necrotic tissue and in situ repair with a Dacron graft. Antibiotics were administered intravenously in the hospital and continued orally after discharge for at least 6 weeks, until clinical and laboratory parameters were normalized. A review of the literature showed that Gram-negative microorganisms are found in 47% of mycotic TAAAs. A trend toward increased mortality for these organisms, compared with Gram-positive microorganisms, was observed (P =.09). Lifelong antimicrobial therapy is controversial. No difference in survival or recurrence rate was found between series advocating lifelong therapy and those suggesting prolonged (6 weeks to 12 months) therapy (median follow-up period, 18 and 19 months, respectively). In situ repair with synthetic material can be successful if prompt confirmation of infection is obtained, all possibly infected tissue is resected, and antibiotic therapy based on sensitivity data is administered for a prolonged period. A short-term survival rate as high as 82% can be expected with this strategy, but data on long-term survival rates are limited. Polytetrafluoroethylene-expanded grafts, homografts, and antibiotic-bonded grafts may offer advantages over Dacron grafts, but data are insufficient to draw conclusions. Careful long-term follow-up is an important element of the treatment of these patients. We suggest antibiotic treatment until biochemical parameters of inflammation (white cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein) return to normal and a computerized tomography scan every 3 months for 1 year, then annually.",

    "abstract": "Recognizing the importance of basic science teaching in surgical education, the leadership of the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery (APDVS) appointed a panel to gather information and to present its findings at the 1999 annual fall meeting of the Apdvs. A questionnaire was distributed to the program directors present. In addition, information was gathered from the American Board of Surgery regarding the basic science content in the vascular surgery item pool on the vascular surgery qualifying examination (VQE). The vascular surgery unit of the surgical resident curriculum was also analyzed. Fifty-three program directors (64%) completed the questionnaire. Although only two program directors felt that their residents were better prepared to answer basic science questions, the results of the Vqe showed that the examinees do not, as a group, perform differently on basic science items than on clinical management questions. In addition, only a minority of program directors (15%) use a specific method to monitor the learning process of their residents. The majority of the program directors responding (75%) felt that they were capable of teaching basic science to residents. Interestingly, almost half the 53 respondents (47%) said that a basic science curriculum should be comprehensive, not exclusively relevant to the clinical setting. Vqe content outline and the vascular surgery unit of the surgical resident curriculum revealed great emphasis on clinically relevant basic science information. The Apdvs panel recommends that a basic science curriculum should be comprehensive, yet clinically pertinent, and completely integrated with the clinical curriculum. In terms of how to teach basic science in vascular residencies, the panel supports teaching conferences that are problem-based with a faculty member acting as the \"resource person\" and with specific goals set for the conferences. The panel also suggested establishing a Web site that provides a series of questions, the answers of which could be readily available to trainees and program directors. such immediate feedback could be of great help to program directors to focus the learning process of their residents and monitor its progress.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the hypothesis that fibrinogen increased DNA synthesis (and cell proliferation) of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) cultured from human saphenous vein and that the increased DNA synthesis was attenuated when cells were cultured on polymeric collagen.\nSMCs were cultured from human saphenous vein on plastic, fibronectin, monomeric, and polymeric collagen. Fibrinogen products were prepared by proteolytic digestion. DNA synthesis was measured by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation into DNA, cell proliferation by cell counting, cyclic adenosine monophosphate by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and fibrinopeptide B labeled with iodine 125 used for binding studies.\nFibrin monomer (0.003-0.1 micromol/L) stimulated a concentration-dependent increase in DNA synthesis of up to 10-fold, which could be inhibited by the peptide Bbeta15-42. The stimulation of DNA synthesis was highest for cells cultured on plastic and lowest for cells cultured on type I collagen polymer. Much higher concentrations of fibrinogen (0.3-1 micromol/L) were required to effect similar increases in DNA synthesis. Fibrinogen had a particular effect to augment DNA synthesis, up to 14-fold, when cells were cultured on monomeric type I collagen. This augmented DNA synthesis was inhibited by a neutralizing antibody to urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Incubation of cells cultured on collagen monomer with fibrinogen resulted in production of fibrinopeptide B. Fibrinopeptide B (5 micromol/L) increased DNA synthesis by fourfold and had additive effects with fibrin monomer to increase DNA synthesis. Iodinated tyrosine fibrinopeptide B bound to SMCs (dissociation constant 0.6 micromol/L).\nCultured human saphenous vein SMCs appear to have high-affinity receptors for fibrin monomer and fibrinopeptide B, the engagement of which stimulates DNA synthesis. These mechanisms may be pertinent to the association between fibrinogen and vein graft stenosis in vivo.",

The stimulation of DNA synthesis was highest for cells cultured on plastic and lowest for cells cultured on type I collagen polymer. Much higher concentrations of fibrinogen (0.3-1 micromol/L) were required to effect similar increases in DNA synthesis. Fibrinogen had a particular effect to augment DNA synthesis, up to 14-fold, when cells were cultured on monomeric type I collagen. This augmented DNA synthesis was inhibited by a neutralizing antibody to urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Incubation of cells cultured on collagen monomer with fibrinogen resulted in production of fibrinopeptide B. Fibrinopeptide B (5 micromol/L) increased DNA synthesis by fourfold and had additive effects with fibrin monomer to increase DNA synthesis. Iodinated tyrosine fibrinopeptide B bound to SMCs (dissociation constant 0.6 micromol/L).",

    "abstract": "Hind limb ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury increases gut permeability, and resultant endotoxemia is associated with an amplified systemic inflammatory response syndrome leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. We studied the potential role of recombinant bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (rBPI(21) ), a novel antiendotoxin therapy, in modulating endotoxin-enhanced systemic inflammatory response syndrome in hind limb I/R injury.\nIn this prospective, randomized, controlled, experimental animal study, 48 male Wistar rats, weighing 300 to 350 g, were randomized to a control group (sham) and five groups undergoing 3 hours bilateral hind limb ischemia with 2 hours reperfusion (I/R) (n = 8 per group). The control and untreated I/R groups received thaumatin, a control-protein preparation, at 2 mg/kg. Treatment groups were administered rBPI(21) intravenously at 1, 2, or 4 mg/kg body weight at the beginning of reperfusion; an additional group was administered rBPI(21) intravenously at 2 mg/kg after 1 hour of reperfusion. Plasma interleukin-6 concentration was estimated by bioassay as a measure of systemic inflammation. Plasma endotoxin concentration was determined by use of an amebocyte lysate chromogenic assay. Crossreactive immunoglobulin G and M antibodies to the highly conserved inner core region of endotoxin were measured by use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The lung tissue wet-to-dry weight ratio and myeloperoxidase concentration were used as markers of edema and neutrophil sequestration, respectively.\nI/R provoked highly significant elevation in plasma interleukin-6 concentrations (1351.20 pg/mL [860.16 - 1886.40 pg/mL]) compared with controls (125.32 pg/mL [87.76-157.52 pg/mL; P <.0001]), but treatment with rBPI(21) 2 mg/kg at onset of reperfusion (715.89 pg/mL [573.36-847.76 pg/mL]) significantly decreased interleukin-6 response compared with the nontreatment group ( P <.016). I/R increased plasma endotoxin concentrations significantly (21.52 pg/mL [6.20-48.23 pg/mL]), compared with control animals (0.90 pg/mL [0.00-2.30 pg/mL; P <.0001]), and treatment with rBPI(21) 4 mg/kg at reperfusion significantly decreased endotoxemia (1.30 pg/mL [1.20-2.20 pg/mL]), compared with the untreated group ( P <.001). The lung tissue myeloperoxidase level was significantly increased in the untreated I/R group (208.18% [128.79%-221.81%]), compared with in controls (62.00% [40.45%-80.92%; P <.0001]), and attenuated in those treated with rBPI(21) 2 mg/kg (129.54% [90.49%-145.78%; P <.05]). Data represent median and interquartile range, comparisons made with the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test.\nThese findings show that hind limb ischemia-reperfusion injury is associated with endotoxemia, elevations in plasma interleukin-6, and pulmonary leukosequestration. Treatment with rBPI(21) after ischemia reduces endotoxemia, the interleukin-6 response, and attenuates pulmonary leukosequestration in response to hind limb reperfusion injury.",

    "abstract": "Experiments were designed to determine effects of dietary supplementation with L -arginine on structure and function of flow-restricted vein grafts.\nSaphenous veins were placed as bilateral interposition grafts in femoral arteries of two groups of adult male mongrel dogs; one group was maintained on a normal diet (control), the other group supplemented with L -arginine (200 mg/kg per day) beginning 1 week before surgery. In each dog, flow was reduced by 50% in one graft by placing an adjustable clamp on the artery distal to the distal anastomosis. Plasma amino acids and oxidized products of nitric oxide (NO(x )) were measured before and after L -arginine feeding. At postoperative week 4, grafts were removed and prepared for organ chamber studies to determine functions of the endothelium or smooth muscle and for histology.\nPlasma L -arginine increased within 3 hours after feeding and increased from 141 +/- 8 nmol/mL to 169 +/- 11 nmol/mL (n = 6) after 5 weeks of supplementation. Plasma ornithine and citrulline paralleled arginine, whereas circulating NO(x ) was unchanged. Maximal contractions to 60 mmol/L KCl were reduced in grafts from L -arginine-fed dogs. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to the calcium ionophore A23187 and relaxations of the smooth muscle NO were reduced in grafts from L -arginine-fed dogs. Neointimal hyperplasia was increased in grafts with reduced flow and not affected by arginine feeding.\nDietary supplementation with L -arginine did not increase plasma NO in dogs with peripheral vein grafts or increase endothelium-dependent relaxations in control or flow-restricted grafts. Therefore, dietary supplementation with L -arginine may not improve long-term functions of flow-restricted peripheral bypass grafts.",

    "abstract": "Indirect evidence suggests that tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) either limits or does not alter restenosis. However, tPA enhances tumor invasiveness through matrix remodeling, and several elements of degraded matrix enhance smooth muscle cell mitogenesis. We use either local adenoviral-mediated overexpression of tPA or systemic infusion of recombinant tPA combined with mechanical overdilation of rabbit common femoral arteries to evaluate the impact of tPA on neointima formation.\nLeft common femoral arteries of New Zealand white rabbits were transfected in situ either with an adenoviral-construct-expressing tPA or a viral control (adenoviral-construct-expressing beta-galactosidase) or nonviral (buffer) control after balloon angioplasty injury. At 7 and 28 days, left common femoral artery segments were harvested (n = 4 for each group and time point). Vessel segments were examined for intimato-media ratio, smooth muscle cell proliferation, extracellular matrix, and inflammatory response. Thrombus formation was evaluated after 3 days (n = 3 for each group). In a second experiment, New Zealand white rabbits (n = 3 per group, per time point) underwent mechanical dilation followed by buffer treatment or systemic tPA infusion according to a widely clinically used accelerated infusion protocol. Treated artery segments were harvested after 7 or 28 days and processed for intima-to-media ratio determination and class-wide histochemical determination of collagenous extracellular matrix and collagen content.\nBoth rate and degree of neointima formation increase dramatically with overexpression (250%-461% relative to controls at 7 and 28 days). Substantial early matrix degradation is observed in vessels treated with local overexpression of tPA, although no increases in local inflammation or in smooth muscle proliferation occur. Late enhancement of smooth muscle proliferation emerges, consistent with secondary impact of perturbed matrix components. Systemic infusion of tPA according to clinical protocols also results in early and late enhancement of neointima formation in this model (34%-52% relative to controls at at 7 and 28 days), with significant early collagenous matrix degradation. Systemic infusion, although significant, did not attain the degree of neointima formation present with overexpression.\nWith some evidence of dose-dependence, tissue plasminogen activator enhances neointima formation after angioplasty in a rabbit model. Early matrix degradation precedes change in rates of proliferation and underlies this effect in spite of several antirestenotic actions including decreased thrombus and decreased macrophage recruitment in this model.",

    "abstract": "Anastomotic compliance is an important predictive factor for long-term patency of small diameter vascular reconstruction. In this experimental study we compare the compliance of continuous and interrupted sutured vascular anastomoses with those using nonpenetrating clips.\nBoth common carotid arteries in nine goats (average weight, 57 +/- 5.7 kg) were transected, and end-to-end anastomoses were constructed with nonpenetrating clips or polypropylene sutures. The latter were applied with both interrupted and continuous techniques. Intraluminal pressure was measured with a Millar Mikro-tip transducer, and vessel wall motion was determined with duplex ultrasound equipped with an echo-locked wall-tracking system. Diametrical compliance was determined. Environmental scanning electron microscopy was performed on explanted anastomoses.\nThere was a reduction in anastomotic compliance and associated proximal and distal para-anastomotic hypercompliant zones with the use of all techniques. However, compliance loss was significantly less in those anastomoses with clips and interrupted sutures when compared with continuous suture (P <.001). Furthermore, the total compliance mismatch across anastomoses with continuous sutures was significantly greater than those with clips or interrupted sutures (P <.05). The mean time for constructing clipped anastomoses was 5.7 +/- 1.4 minutes, which was significantly less than either continuous (P <.0001) or interrupted sutures (P <.0001). Furthermore, environmental scanning electron microscopy demonstrated minimal intimal damage with good intimal apposition in the clip group.\nAnastomoses performed with nonpenetrating clips resulted in improved para-anastomotic compliance profiles and reduced intimal damage when compared with those with polypropylene sutures. These benefits may enhance long-term graft patency by reducing the risk of anastomotic intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Aneurysms of the visceral arteries are infrequently encountered. Many are found incidentally and are thought to have a benign outcome. To better characterize these lesions and their clinical course, we reviewed our experience with visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs) at a single institution.\nA retrospective analysis of all VAAs diagnosed at our institution over the past 10 years was performed. The presentation, management, and outcome of therapy was examined for each patient.\nThirty-four VAAs in 26 patients were diagnosed over the past 10 years. Four patients had multiple VAAs: splenic (17), hepatic (7), celiac (3), superior mesenteric (2), gastroduodenal (2), pancreaticoduodenal (1), right gastric (1), ileal (1) artery aneurysms. Associated aneurysms were found in 31% of patients and involved the thoracic aorta (3 patients), abdominal aorta (4 patients), renal arteries (2 patients), iliac artery (3 patients), lower extremity (1 patient), and intracranium (1 patient). In 15 patients (58%), VAAs were detected before rupture by chance or because abdominal symptoms resulted in diagnostic evaluation. Eight of these underwent elective surgery, and there were no deaths. Of those 15 patients with known VAAs, one patient died of rupture and hemorrhage from an untreated splenic artery aneurysm. Eleven patients (42%) presented unexpectedly with rupture, and two died despite prompt surgical treatment. The mortality rate in patients who had ruptured VAAs was 25%, including those who presented with ruptured aneurysms and those observed whose aneurysms eventually ruptured.\nAneurysms of the visceral arteries are rare but important vascular lesions. Associated aneurysms are common. Because of the risk of rupture, often with a fatal outcome, an aggressive approach to the treatment of VAA is essential.",

In this study, we evaluate our results with brachial artery reconstruction in patients who present with symptomatic atherosclerotic occlusive disease and compare this cohort's demographics with a similar group with lower extremity ischemia.\nFrom 1986 to 1998, all patients presenting for upper extremity revascularization with chronic ischemia were prospectively entered into a vascular registry. Demographics, indications, outcomes, and patency were recorded. Patients presenting with embolus, pseudoaneurysm, or trauma were excluded. The Fisher exact and Student t tests were used to assess significance.\nFifty-one (83%) bypass grafts were performed with autogenous conduit and the remainder with polytetrafluoroethylene. Indications included 18 (30%) patients with exertional arm pain, 35 (57%) with rest pain, and 8 (13%) with tissue loss. Twenty-five (45%) patients were male, 8 (14%) had diabetes, and 30 (54%) were smokers. The mean age was 58 years (range, 33-93). The operative mortality rate was 1.8%, and follow-up ranged from 1 to 140 months. Eight occlusions were identified, with six occurring early. Five of these were in women with a smoking history.

    "abstract": "The outcome of patients who underwent radical resection of renal cell carcinoma extending into the vena cava was retrospectively analyzed, and risk factors for long-term survival were investigated.\nFrom 1983 to 1999, 33 patients who had renal cell carcinoma with inferior vena caval tumor extension underwent 34 surgical procedures. There were 27 men and six women with an average age of 60.1 years. Twenty-two cases (64.7%) were classified as stage III (T1-2 N1 M0 or T3 N0-1 M0), and 12 cases (35.3%) as stage IV (T4 or N2-3 or M1). Coexistent lung metastasis was found in seven cases (20.6%). The tumor thrombi invaded into the inferior vena cava below the hepatic hilum in 19 cases, below the orifice of hepatic veins in 12, and above the diaphragm in 3. Cardiopulmonary bypass graft was applied in 13 cases (38.2%). Inferior vena cava was reconstructed by direct suture (n = 19), polytetrafluoroethylene patch angioplasty (n = 13), or graft replacement (n = 2).\nTwo patients died during the early postoperative period because of retrohepatic caval injury and intraoperative pulmonary embolism. Late death occurred in 16 patients; the causes of death were tumor recurrence in 15 and acute pulmonary embolism as a result of graft thrombosis in 1. Overall 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 70%, 44%, and 26.4%, respectively. One- and 5-year survival rates were 81.3% and 52.9% for stage III and 50% and 31.2% for stage IV; a statistically significant correlation was found between surgical staging and survival (P =.049). Patients without lymph node metastasis had a significant survival advantage over those with lymph node metastasis (P =.022). There was no significant difference in survival on the basis of the presence or absence of synchronous lung metastasis (P =.291). The degree of local extension of the tumor or the level of tumor thrombus did not tend to influence survival.\nSurgical prognosis in patients with renal cell carcinoma extending into the vena cava was determined by the staging of the tumor, especially lymph node status, and not by the level of tumor thrombus or the presence of concurrent lung metastasis. The use of cardiopulmonary bypass graft is recommended for the resection of tumor thrombus extending over the diaphragm.",

Demographics, comorbidities, method of diagnosis, and treatment for SAVT were recorded. Long-term follow-up was obtained by chart review and asking patients to complete the DASH (disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand) questionnaire that was developed by the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons.\nTwenty-eight patients, 20 men and eight women, with a mean age of 36 were treated during the study period. The median time between onset of symptoms and treatment was 5.5 (range, 1-100) days. All patients had confirmation of the diagnosis by venography. Twenty-five patients received thrombolytic treatment with catheter-directed infusions of urokinase; in the other three patients the vein was chronically occluded. Twelve patients had some degree of residual stenosis and were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty after thrombolysis. During the study period two patients underwent decompressive surgery. Twenty-one patients responded to the DASH questionnaire a mean of 2.9 years (range, 2 months to 8 years) after the episode of SAVT. Six (28%) of 21 patients were completely symptom free, 13 patients (62%) had DASH scores consistent with mild symptoms, and two patients had more severe symptoms. Twenty percent (4 of 21) of patients report some difficulty with work.\nThrombolysis, followed by selective thoracic outlet decompression on the basis of the severity of patients' symptoms can be used as a therapeutic approach to SAVT without undue morbidity. The DASH questionnaire is a useful tool to evaluate results after therapy for SAVT.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of incompetent perforators increases linearly with the clinical severity of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and the presence of deep vein incompetence. Putative transmission of deep vein pressure to skin may cause dermal hypoxia and ulceration. Despite extensive prospective interest in the contribution of perforators toward CVI, their hemodynamic role remains controversial. The aim of this prospective study was to determine the in situ hemodynamic performance of incompetent perforating veins across the clinical spectrum of CVI, by means of duplex ultrasonography.\nA total of 265 perforating veins of 90 legs that had clinical signs and symptoms consistent with CVI in 67 patients referred consecutively to the blood flow laboratory were studied. The clinical distribution of the examined limbs was CEAP(0), 10 limbs; CEAP(1-2), 39 limbs; CEAP(3-4), 21 limbs; and CEAP(5-6), 20 limbs. With the use of gated-Doppler ultrasonography on real-time B-mode imaging, the flow velocity waveforms were obtained from the lumen of perforators on release of manual distal leg compression in the sitting position and analyzed for peak and mean velocities, time to peak velocity, volume flow, venous volume displaced outward, and flow pulsatility. The diameter and duration of outward flow (abnormal reflux > 0.5 seconds) were also measured.\nIncompetent perforators had bigger diameters, higher peak and mean velocities and volume flow, longer time to peak velocity, and bigger venous volume displaced outward (VV(outward)) than competent perforators (all, P <.0001). The diameter of incompetent perforators did not change significantly with CEAP class (all, P >.1). Incompetent thigh and lower-third calf perforators had a significantly bigger diameter than perforators in the upper and middle calf combined (both, P <.05), in incompetent perforators: reflux duration was unaffected by CEAP class or site (P >.3); peak velocity was higher in those in CEAP(3-4) than those in CEAP(1-2) (P =.024); mean velocity in those in CEAP(3-6) during the first second of reflux was twice that of those in CEAP(1-2) (P <.0001); both higher volume flow and VV(outward) were found in the thigh perforators than those in the upper and middle calf thirds (P <.03); CEAP(3-6) volume flow and VV(outward), both in the first second, were twice that in those in CEAP(1-2) (P <.002); flow pulsatility in those in CEAP(5-6) was lower than in those in CEAP(1-2) (P =.014); in deep vein incompetence, higher peak velocity, volume flow, VV(outward), and diameter occurred than in its absence (P <.01). CEAP designation correlated significantly with mean velocity and flow pulsatility, both in the first second (r = 0.3, P <.01). The flow direction pattern in perforator incompetence was uniform across the CVI spectrum: inward on distal manual limb compression, and outward on its release; competent perforators had a smaller percentage of outward flow on limb compression (P <.01).\nIn addition to an increase in diameter, perforator incompetence is characterized by significantly higher mean and peak flow velocities, volume flow, and venous volume displaced outward, and a lower flow pulsatility. Differences in early reflux enable a better hemodynamic stratification of incompetent perforators in CVI classes. In the presence of deep reflux, incompetent perforators sustain further hemodynamic impairment. In situ hemodynamics enable quantification of the function of perforators and can be used in the identification of the clinically relevant perforators and the impact of surgery.",

    "conclusions": "In addition to an increase in diameter, perforator incompetence is characterized by significantly higher mean and peak flow velocities, volume flow, and venous volume displaced outward, and a lower flow pulsatility. Differences in early reflux enable a better hemodynamic stratification of incompetent perforators in CVI classes. In the presence of deep reflux, incompetent perforators sustain further hemodynamic impairment. In situ hemodynamics enable quantification of the function of perforators and can be used in the identification of the clinically relevant perforators and the impact of surgery.",

The diameter of incompetent perforators did not change significantly with CEAP class (all, P >.1). Incompetent thigh and lower-third calf perforators had a significantly bigger diameter than perforators in the upper and middle calf combined (both, P <.05), in incompetent perforators: reflux duration was unaffected by CEAP class or site (P >.3); peak velocity was higher in those in CEAP(3-4) than those in CEAP(1-2) (P =.024); mean velocity in those in CEAP(3-6) during the first second of reflux was twice that of those in CEAP(1-2) (P <.0001); both higher volume flow and VV(outward) were found in the thigh perforators than those in the upper and middle calf thirds (P <.03); CEAP(3-6) volume flow and VV(outward), both in the first second, were twice that in those in CEAP(1-2) (P <.002); flow pulsatility in those in CEAP(5-6) was lower than in those in CEAP(1-2) (P =.014); in deep vein incompetence, higher peak velocity, volume flow, VV(outward), and diameter occurred than in its absence (P <.01). CEAP designation correlated significantly with mean velocity and flow pulsatility, both in the first second (r = 0.3, P <.01). The flow direction pattern in perforator incompetence was uniform across the CVI spectrum: inward on distal manual limb compression, and outward on its release; competent perforators had a smaller percentage of outward flow on limb compression (P <.01).",

    "abstract": "Complex forms of congenital venous malformation have defied proper classification and confounded therapy. Through a newly designed multidisciplinary approach, these venous defects were properly diagnosed and classified according to the Hamburg classification. Absolute ethanol was adopted as a new scleroagent for this complex form of venous defects to improve overall treatment results with acceptable morbidity and recurrence rates.\nAmong 318 patients aged 2 months to 60 years (130 men: mean age, 24.6 years; 188 women: mean age, 24.5 years), 143 patients were confirmed as having venous defects predominantly (45%). We conducted diagnostic evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging, whole body blood pool scan, duplex scans, transarterial microalbumin lung scans, air plethysmography, bone x-ray film, and angiography. Thirty of 143 patients were indicated for the absolute ethanol sclerotherapy for the complex form of venous defects, and they completed 98 sessions of multistage therapy with direct puncture technique. Follow-up assessment (minimum, 6 months; average, 10.2 months) was made as early results after completion of therapy.\nThe immediate success rate at the completion of treatment through 98 sessions on 30 patients was 92% (90/98). The reason for the failure of 8% (8/98 sessions) was mainly due to the lesion's inaccessibility to the nidus to deliver the alcohol safely. On follow-up assessment available on 28 of 30 patients, overall improvement of the lesions with good to fair response on clinical assessment was obtained in 27 (96%) of 28 patients. Similar good to fair responses were obtained on whole body blood pool scan assessment (14 [93%] of 15 patients) and also on magnetic resonance imaging assessment (12 [93%] of 13 patients). Various major to minor acute complications developed during the procedure in eight (26.7%) of 30 patients through 16 (16.3%) of 98 sessions of the therapy: ischemic bullae, tissue fibrosis, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, peripheral nerve palsy, and temporary pulmonary hypertension. All 24 incidences of complication were successfully managed with full recovery except one case of permanent peroneal nerve palsy that was present during 18 months of follow-up. No single recurrence has been detected to date.\nAbsolute ethanol sclerotherapy alone can deliver excellent results in complex forms of venous malformations with considerable but acceptable morbidity and may be able to reduce the morbidity involved with the conventional surgical therapy alone on complex forms of venous malformation. No recurrence or deterioration of the therapy results was observed during the follow-up period (average, 10.2 months) after the completion of multistaged therapy.",

This study was conducted as a single-center side arm to a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of dopexamine hydrochloride on its incidence.\nThirty patients, mean age 65.1 years (range, 46-84), undergoing elective infrarenal aortic surgery were entered. Preoperative hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were optimized. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive a perioperative infusion of dopexamine at 2 microg/kg per minute (n = 12) or 0.9% saline placebo (n = 18). All patients underwent colonoscopy and biopsy preoperatively and 1 week postoperatively. Specimens were assessed for evidence of mucosal ischemia, presence of mast cell tryptase, myeloperoxidase activity, and both the inducible and endothelial isoforms of nitric oxide synthase.\nThere was no significant difference in perioperative fluid and blood requirements or hemodynamic and respiratory parameters between the two groups. However, there was significantly less evidence of mucosal ischemic changes in dopexamine-treated patients (n = 1) compared with placebo (n = 8) (P =.049). Furthermore, when preoperative biopsies were compared with those performed 1 week postoperatively, nine (50%) patients in the placebo group and two (16.7%) in the dopexamine group scored worse. Although there was no significant difference in inflammatory markers between the two groups, both mast cell tryptase and myeloperoxidase expression were increased in patients with histologic evidence of ischemia (P <.05). Furthermore, inducible nitric oxide synthase staining within the vascular (P =.001) and lamina propria (P <.05) components of the mucosa was also significantly greater.\nA perioperative dopexamine infusion affords significant histologic protection to colonic mucosa after aortic surgery.",

    "abstract": "The United Kingdom Small Aneurysm study has demonstrated the low risk of rupture in aneurysms less than 5.5 cm in diameter. With the advent of endoluminal techniques, patients considered unfit to undergo laparotomy are now considered for endovascular repair. However, the natural history of aneurysms larger than 5.5 cm remains uncertain, especially when severe comorbidity is present. In our center, we prospectively maintain records of all patients for whom elective aneurysm surgery was refused. This study documented the outcome of all patients referred with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) larger than 5.5 cm in diameter who were turned down for elective open repair and determined the cause of death and risk of rupture in all patients.\nDetails of all patients with AAAs from January 5, 1989, to January 5, 1999, were recorded, and demographic details on all patients with AAAs larger than 5.5 cm were collected. Copies of death certificates were obtained from the Office of National Statistics, local in-hospital patient records, and general practitioner records. Results of postmortem examinations were also obtained. Aneurysms were stratified according to their size at presentation (5.5-5.9 cm, 6.0-7.0 cm, and > 7.0 cm), and the reasons no intervention was made were documented.\nA total of 106 patients were turned down for elective aneurysm surgery in the 10-year period (10.6 per year). The mean age of the patients was 78.4 years (SD, 7.4), and 70 were men and 36 were women. At the end of the study, 76 patients (71.7%) had died. Overall, the 3-year survival rate was 17%. Patients with AAAs larger than 7.0 cm lived a median of 9 months. A ruptured aneurysm was certified as a cause of death in 36% of the patients with an AAA of 5.5 to 5.9 cm, in 50% of the patients with an AAA of 6 to 7.0 cm, and 55% of the patients with an AAA larger than 7.0 cm. Reasons given for not intervening were patient refusal (31 cases), the patient being \"unfit for surgery\" (18 cases), the \"advanced age\" of the patient (18 cases), cardiac disease (9 cases), cancer (9 cases), respiratory disease (6 cases), and other (15 cases).\nAlthough we recognize the problems with death certification, we found that rupture was a significant cause of death in patients with an untreated AAA that was larger than 5.5 cm. Although little difference in outcome was observed in aneurysms in the 5.5 to 7.0 cm size range, patients with an AAA that was larger than 7.0 cm seemed to have a much poorer prognosis.",

    "abstract": "The mortality of an unrepaired abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) generally exceeds the mortality associated with surgical repair. However, as our longevity increases, more frequently we see patients whose risk of surgical repair approximates the risk of rupture. We present an extra-anatomic bypass graft with complete aneurysm exclusion by iliac ligation and coil embolization of the aneurysm as an alternative for these high-risk patients.\nAn extra-anatomic bypass graft, followed by bilateral iliac artery ligation (retroperitoneal approach) and complete coil embolization of the AAA, was performed in eight patients (mean age, 77 years) found to be at prohibitive operative risk because of multiple comorbidities (American Society of Anesthesiologists class IV). Most patients (5 of 8) were symptomatic on presentation with a mean AAA diameter of 7 cm (range, 6.7-9.5 cm). We repair approximately 30 infrarenal aneurysms per year electively at our institution.\nAll patients tolerated the surgical procedures. The average hospital stay was 8 days. All but two aneurysms demonstrated complete thrombosis by 48 hours. After 48 months there was no incidence of graft thrombosis, peripheral ischemia, visceral ischemia or thrombus infection. There was one perioperative death from aspiration pneumonia. Seventy-five percent (6 of 8) of patients have survived at least 1 year without surgical complications. No patient has had a ruptured aneurysm.\nCombining an extra-anatomic bypass graft and complete exclusion of the AAA by ligation of the common iliac arteries and a coil embolization is an effective, less invasive treatment option for patients with AAA and prohibitive operative risk. We emphasize the need for complete embolization documented by decreased aneurysm size.",

    "abstract": "The failure to maintain a secure exclusion of aortic aneurysms with intraluminally placed grafts has been termed endoleak. We performed a retrospective review of our first 100 transluminally repaired abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in an effort to identify preoperative factors that could predict which patients would have endoleaks.\nBetween February 1993 and September 1998, 100 infrarenal aneurysms were treated with tube (39), bifurcated (45), and aortoiliac grafts (16). Endoleaks (early and late) developed in 34 patients. Preoperative computed tomography scans and angiograms for all patients were individually inspected by a single reviewer. Aortic characteristics analyzed included number of patent lumbar arteries, presence of a patent inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), calcification and thrombus at proximal and distal attachment sites, proximal aortic angulation, and graft-vessel size discrepancy at proximal and distal attachment sites. The prevalence of the preoperative factors was compared among patients with and without endoleaks.\nEndoleaks developed in 44% of tube, 33% of bifurcated, and 47% of aortoiliac grafts (P =.51). Correlation between total number of patent lumbar arteries, presence of a patent IMA, and endoleaks was not significant (P =.44,.95). Calcification at either proximal or distal attachment site did not increase the risk of endoleaks (P =.50,.62). The presence of thrombus at the attachment site (proximally or distally) also failed to increase endoleak rates (P =.12,.78). Degree of proximal aortic angulation did not differ between groups (P =.39). Size discrepancies between graft and aorta or iliac vessels at proximal or distal sites did not significantly differ (P >.54, >.13). Subgroup analysis of endoleaks with different tube types also failed to demonstrate significant differences among the three graft types (P >.05).\nEndoleaks develop in a significant number of endovascularly repaired AAAs. We were unable to demonstrate a statistically significant association with anatomic characteristics thought to predispose to the development of endoleaks.

    "abstract": "Research with animal models has demonstrated tissue healing of endovascular grafts in both native arterial segments and in experimentally created arterial aneurysms. Fundamental to the successful clinical use of endovascular grafts for the treatment of aneurysmal disease is the creation of a permanent hemostatic seal between the graft ends and the arterial wall. Characteristics of this healing process in patients with aneurysmal disease have not been fully studied. In this study, we analyzed the macroscopic and histopathologic changes of the arterial wall after endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms.\nOver a 7-year period, 313 patients were treated with endovascular grafts to exclude arterial aneurysms of the thoracic and abdominal aorta. Of these patients, 11 had their endovascular grafts recovered for analysis. Five graft specimens were recovered during subsequent open aortic surgery. Six grafts were recovered at autopsy after the death of the patient of causes unrelated to the patient's endovascular graft. All specimens were fixed in formalin. Histologic analysis included light microscopy with hematoxylin and eosin and trichrome stains. Well-preserved specimens were selected after light microscopic examination and postfixed in 3% buffered glutaraldehyde for electron microscopy. The aortas from autopsy specimens were removed en bloc and fixed in formalin; representative regions of each graft were sectioned for analysis. Adherence of the graft to the vessel wall was categorized as densely adherent or easily separated after graft explantation. Traction applied to the graft-aortic anastomosis was equal to traction generated by suspending a standardized 2-kg weight. Infrarenal graft specimens were obtained with supraceliac aortic clamping, longitudinal aortotomy, and graft sampling before endograft revision.\nIn eight patients, endograft fixation was found to be firmly adherent to the arterial wall. A translucent film of fibrinous material was consistently seen across the entire luminal surface of the endograft. Light and electron microscopy failed to demonstrate an endothelial layer or organized pseudointima at the graft-artery interface.\nDespite suggestive experimental data regarding endograft healing in animals, minimal graft incorporation was apparent in the stent grafts recovered in this study. A greater emphasis on the construction and mechanism of fixation of endograft attachment systems will be important for long-term device function.",

    "abstract": "Given the uncertainties associated with carotid angioplasty and stenting, the initial assessment of the procedure may be best undertaken in a subgroup of patients at increased risk for complications with standard carotid surgery. In an effort to characterize such a subgroup, we reviewed the results of carotid endarterectomy in patients with and without significant medical comorbidity.\nDuring a 10-year period 3061 carotid endarterectomies were performed at a single institution and entered prospectively into a registry. A high-risk patient subgroup was identified, defined by the presence of severe coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, or renal insufficiency. The outcome of carotid endarterectomy was assessed with respect to perioperative stroke, myocardial infarction, or death, as well as the combined end point of one or more of the end points.\nThe rate of the composite end point stroke/myocardial infarction/death was 3.8% in the total group of 3061 patients who underwent endarterectomy. As individual end points, the rate of stroke was 2.1%, myocardial infarction 1.2%, and death 1.1%. Among the high-risk subset, the composite end point stroke/myocardial infarction/death occurred in 7.4%. This rate was significantly greater than the corresponding rate of 2.9% in the low-risk subset (P <.0005). Similarly, the rate of stroke (3.5% vs 1.7%, P =.008) or death (4.4% vs 0.3%, P <.001) as solitary events was significantly greater in high-risk patients.\nAlthough carotid endarterectomy is an extremely safe procedure in most patients, results are not as favorable in a high-risk subset with severe coronary, pulmonary, or renal disease. The initial clinical evaluation of carotid stenting might best be undertaken in such a high-risk population, one that comprises patients for whom standard therapy is associated with a high rate of complications.",

    "abstract": "This study defined how ankle arterial blood pressure measurements should be analyzed for the detection of moderate arterial disease (asymptomatic while walking). We used external iliac artery endofibrosis as a unique model of an isolated moderate arterial lesion, the role of which in exercise-related pain can be surgically proven.\nPatients who were ambulatory in our institutional referral center were studied. Brachial pressures, ankle pressures, and heart rate were measured simultaneously on all four limbs at rest and after maximal exercise in 108 healthy athletes and 78 patients (among 89 athletes referred for suspicion of endofibrosis) with confirmed or excluded external iliac endofibrosis. For these 78 patients, we calculated systolic ankle pressure change, ankle/brachial index, and deviation from the ankle/brachial index to heart rate regression line (DAHR) that was defined in the 108 healthy athletes.\nIn patients with endofibrosis, ankle/brachial index and ankle pressure were normal at rest. One minute after exercise, areas (mean +/- SE of area) under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the diagnosis of endofibrosis were 0.91 +/- 0.02, 0.91 +/- 0.03, 0.95 +/- 0.02, and 0.96 +/- 0.02 for ankle pressure, pressure change, ankle/brachial index, and DAHR, respectively. For all criteria, area decreased with time in the recovery period.\nAfter heavy-load exercise, the ankle/brachial index at minute 1 should be used rather than the systolic ankle pressure value or ankle pressure change as a means of improving the efficacy of the detection of endofibrosis in athletes. A 0.66 value of the index at minute 1 after maximal exercise seems an optimal cutoff point for clinical use, providing a 90% sensitivity rate and 87% specificity rate in the diagnosis of moderate arterial lesions. At rest and after 1 minute of recovery, the ankle/brachial index to heart rate relationship should be considered to be an efficient tool for analyzing the results of pressures measurements and improving detection efficiency.",

Measurements were carried out to obtain ankle and toe pressures, pressure indices, and toe pulse wave amplitude. These variables were related to the risks of major amputation and total and cardiovascular death by means of the Cox proportional hazards model.\nLow toe pulse wave amplitude (< or = 4 mm) was associated with increased risk of amputation (relative risks 4.20 in all limbs and 2.63 in those with toe pressure < or = 30 mm Hg; P <.01). Wave amplitude remained significantly associated with increased risk of amputation after controlling for each pressure variable (P <.01). Low pulse wave amplitude and toe/brachial index were associated with increased risks of both total and cardiovascular death in all patients (relative risks ranged from 1.43-1.73; P <.05) and in those with toe pressure of 30 mm Hg or less (relative risks 1.56-1.90; P <.05).\nLow toe pulse wave amplitude is related significantly to increased risks of amputation and death in patients with skin lesions and arterial disease.

    "abstract": "Accurate measurements of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are required for surgical planning and monitoring over time. We have examined the feasibility of using a three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound imaging system to derive quantitative measurements of interest from AAAs.\nA normal aorta, a small AAA, and an AAA repaired with an endovascular stent graft were scanned with a 3-D ultrasound imaging system. For each case, a 3-D surface reconstruction was generated from manual outlines of a sequence of two-dimensional ultrasound images, registered in 3-D space with a magnetic tracking system. The surfaces were resampled in planes perpendicular to the vessel center axis to calculate cross-sectional area and maximum diameter as a function of distance along the length of the aorta.\nCross-sectional area and maximum diameter were plotted along the length of the aneurysmal aortas from the renal arteries to the aortic bifurcation. The overall maximum diameter was found for both aneurysms. For the small AAA, the distances of the aneurysm from the renal arteries and the bifurcation were measured. For the repaired AAA, the location of the stent graft relative to the renal arteries was measured.\n3-D surface reconstructions from ultrasound images show promise for quantitatively characterizing the geometry of AAAs both before surgery and after endovascular repair.",

    "abstract": "Limb-sparing procedures have recently replaced amputations as the treatment for tumors invading major vessels of the lower extremity. Major arteries must be reconstructed for limb salvage. The veins are not usually reconstructed. This study was undertaken to investigate the sequelae such as chronic venous disease after venous resection for tumors.\nTen patients who underwent limb-sparing surgery for a tumor of the lower extremity or retroperitoneum that required major vascular resection were studied. The median follow-up period was 48 months. After combined resection of a major artery and vein, arterial reconstruction was performed. The veins were not reconstructed. The resected veins included the inferior vena cava (n = 2), the external iliac and common femoral veins (n = 3), the superficial femoral vein (n = 3), and the popliteal vein (n = 2). The main outcome measures were clinical classification of chronic venous disease in 10 patients and air plethysmography in seven patients.\nClinical classification was C(0A) in 6 patients, C(3A) in 1 patient, C(3S) in 2 patients, and C(4S) in 1 patient. Venous claudication with uncontrollable edema was observed in two patients with C(3S) disease. Pain and itching with inflammatory skin changes were observed in one patient with C(4S) disease. These three patients had undergone resection of the femoral vein, including the deep femoral vein along with proximal adductor muscles. Air plethysmography revealed that the ejection fraction was significantly lower and the residual volume fraction was significantly higher in the three patients with symptoms than in symptom-free patients.\nSignificant chronic venous disease was observed in the patients who underwent combined resection of the femoral vein, the deep femoral vein, and the adductor muscles for a tumor.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to identify the peripheral vascular complications associated with the use of percutaneous suture-mediated closure (PSMC) devices and compare them with postcatheterization femoral artery complications not associated with PSMC devices.\nThis is a retrospective review of all patients admitted to the vascular surgery service at the Chattanooga Unit of the University of Tennessee Department of Surgery with a peripheral vascular complication after percutaneous femoral arteriotomy between July 1, 1998, and December 1, 1999. The complications followed the use of PSMC devices (group I, n = 11) and traditional compression therapy (group II, n = 14) to achieve arterial hemostasis. Group II was subdivided into patients who required operative intervention (group IIA, n = 8), and those who were treated without operation (group IIB, n = 6).\nNo significant difference was found between groups I and II with regard to age (P =.227), time to vascular surgery consultation (P =.987), or diagnostic versus therapeutic catheterization (P =.897). A significant difference was found with regard to mean pseudoaneurysm size (group I = 5.9 cm, group II 2.9 cm; P =.003). Ultrasound compression was successfully performed in 66.6% of group II patients, but no (0.0%) patient in group I responded to this therapy (P =.016). Groups I and IIA had a significant difference for mean estimated blood loss (group I = 377.2 mL, group II = 121.8 mL; P =.017) and requirement for transfusion (P =.013). More patients in group I required extensive surgical treatment (P =.007), with six of these patients requiring vein patch angioplasty during their treatment. More patients in group I also had infectious complications (n = 3) compared with group IIA (n = 1).\nIn comparison with complications that follow percutaneous arteriotomy when PSMC devices are not used for hemostasis: (1) pseudoaneurysms after the use of PSMC devices are larger and do not respond to ultrasound compression, (2) complications associated with PSMC devices result in more blood loss and increased need for transfusion and are more likely to require extensive operative procedures, and (3) arterial infections after the use of PSMC devices are more common and require aggressive surgical management.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an easily used disease-specific quality of life (QOL) measure for patients with chronic lower limb ischemia and to design an evaluative instrument, responsive to within-subject change, that adds to clinical measures of outcome when comparing treatment options in the management of lower limb ischemia.\nThe first phase consisted of item generation, item reduction, formulating, and pretesting in patients with ischemia. The proportion of patients who selected an item as troublesome and the mean importance they attached to it were combined to give a clinical impact factor. Items with the highest clinical impact factor were used to formulate a new 25-item questionnaire that was then pretested in 20 patients with lower limb ischemia. In the second phase, reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the new questionnaire were assessed in 39 patients with lower limb ischemia who were tested at 0 and 4 weeks. The King's College Hospital's Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire and the Short-Form 36 were administered at each visit, and treadmill walking distance and ankle/brachial pressure indices were recorded. The new questionnaire's reliability, internal consistency, responsiveness, and validity were determined.\nAreas of QOL impairment were consistent through the ranges of disease severity and age, with no apparent differences between the men and women. Therefore, a single questionnaire is applicable to all patients with chronic lower limb ischemia. In stable patients test-retest scores demonstrated a reliability of r more than 0.90. Each item had internal consistency (item-domain Cronbach alpha =.7-.9). The questionnaire was responsive to change, with correlation between change in the questionnaire's total score and both global and clinical indicators of change (P <.001). The questionnaire showed face and construct validity.\nThis disease-specific questionnaire is reliable, responsive, valid, and ready for use as an outcome measure in clinical trials. It is sensitive to the concerns of patients with lower limb ischemia, offering a simple method to measure the effect of interventions on their QOL.",

    "abstract": "Prosthetic graft infection is an uncommon but life-threatening complication of descending thoracic/thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysmectomy. The purpose of this study was to assess the value of in situ arterial allografts in the management of this complication.\nFrom 1992 to 2000 we treated 11 consecutive patients with prosthetic graft infection after descending thoracic/thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysmectomy by replacing the prosthetic graft with an in situ arterial allograft. There were 10 men and one woman with a mean age of 50.8 years (range, 32-73 years). The primary aortic disease was degenerative aneurysm in 6 patients, chronic type B dissection in 2 patients, inflammatory aneurysm in 1 patient, Marfan's disease in 1 patient, and Beh\u00e7et's disease in 1 patient. Replacement involved only the descending thoracic aorta in three patients and more or less extensive segments of the thoracoabdominal aorta in eight patients. Signs of severe infection were present in all patients, and false anastomotic aneurysms were noted in six patients. Aortoenteric fistula occurred in three patients and aortobronchial fistula in two patients. The causative organisms were identified in nine patients. The mean interval between the primary surgery and reoperation was 33.4 +/- 27.5 months. Reoperation was performed under emergency conditions because of hemorrhage in three patients. Cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was used in seven patients. Allograft replacement of the aorta was associated with reimplantation of intercostal and/or visceral arteries in all patients.\nOne patient died intraoperatively of heart failure during emergency surgery. Two patients died of persistent infection during the postoperative period at 19 and 58 days. Mean follow-up was 34 +/- 19 months. One patient died during the late follow-up period after surgery of the infrarenal aorta. Another patient underwent surgery for stenoses of one branch of a bifurcated allograft and a renal bypass graft to a solitary kidney.\nThe use of in situ arterial allografts is a significant advance in the management of prosthetic graft infection after descending thoracic/thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysmectomy provided that reoperation is performed early.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of first rib hemangioma that caused thoracic outlet syndrome. A 50-year-ole woman who was admitted to our hospital with a clinical diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome presented with fullness and easy fatigue of her right arm. Her right arm discomfort was associated with intermittent engorgement of superficial veins over the shoulder girdle. A chest radiograph revealed an enlargement of the anterior aspect of the first rib with fine bony trabeculations. Computed tomography scan showed contrast enhancement over the enlarged rib. Our tentative preoperative diagnosis was a benign first rib hypertrophic change, such as an old fracture with exuberant callus formation. A right-arm venogram revealed a patent subclavian vein with an extrinsic compression, which occluded on arm abduction. The findings of neural conduction studies of both upper extremities were symmetric and normal. The patient agreed to surgery because of the occlusive condition of the subclavian vein on arm abduction and progressive arm weakness in recent months. Segmental transection of the offending portion of the enlarged first rib was complicated by difficulty in isolating the whole length of the compressed but normal-appearing subclavian vein by our initial transaxillary and infraclavicular approaches because the medial aspect of the subclavian vein was obstructed by the enlarged first rib, which extended medially to the junction of the right jugular and subclavian veins. Successful segmental transection of the enlarged first rib was finally accomplished by combined transaxillary, infraclavicular, and supraclavicular approaches. A moderate amount of rib bleeding from resection ends was noted during segmental resection of the enlarged first rib, resulting in local hematoma formation. A 470-mL bloody discharge was collected from the vacuum ball inserted via the transaxillary route during her 12-day hospitalization. Pathologic examination revealed an intraosseous hemangioma. The patient had a prolonged course to partial recovery of her arm numbness, but signs of venous compression were much improved at 6 months' follow-up. Although hemangioma is benign, its hypervascular nature may cause catastrophic intraoperative bleeding.",

Rarely noted, however, have been peripheral aneurysms. Typically in more proximal vessels, subclavian, femoral, and popliteal aneurysms have been mentioned. We present the case of a patient with type 1 NF and an anterior tibial artery aneurysm that was subsequently resected. neurofibromatous invasion of the vessel was confirmed by means of pathological tests.

Endovascular repair with the branched stent graft was attempted in two patients with a pararenal aortic Aneurysm. Stent grafting was technically successful in both patients. Although postoperative transient renal function impairment and paralytic ileus occurred in patient 2, these complications were gradually resolved in the perioperative period. A substantial shrinkage of the aneurysm was revealed by means of computed tomographic measurements in patient 1. In both patients, complete exclusion of the aneurysm and patency of the bilateral renal arteries and the superior mesenteric artery were confirmed by means of follow-up computed tomographic images at 2 years. This minimally invasive approach for pararenal aortic aneurysms appears to be a viable therapeutic option for patients who are at high risk for open surgery.",

Because cell cycle checkpoint controls are linked to the signaling and execution of apoptotic cascades, we examined the expression of bcl-2 family members bax and bcl-x, known molecular mediators of apoptosis, and that of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a downstream substrate of DNA cleavage.\nTwenty varicose vein specimens were retrieved from 20 patients (10 men, 10 women; mean age, 53.6 +/- 4.7 years) undergoing lower-extremity varicose vein excision. Healthy greater saphenous vein segments (n = 27) were obtained from 27 patients (14 men, 13 women; mean age, 59.5 +/- 2.4 years) undergoing infrainguinal arterial bypass grafting surgery. All tissues were distal portions. As per CEAP classification for chronic lower-extremity venous disease, most of the patients were in class 2 for clinical signs (n = 11); some patients were in class 3 (n = 4) or class 4 (n = 4), and only one patient was in class 5. Five 5-microm thick sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens were used as a means of immunohistochemically localizing the expression of bax, bcl-x, and PARP, and 10 random high-power fields per section were evaluated by two independent reviewers blinded to the clinical findings. Statistical analyses were conducted by means of chi(2), analysis of variance, Student and Fisher exact t tests with StatView software.\nImmunoreactivity to pro-apoptotic bax was significantly higher in the normal veins (P <.001). Cytoplasmic expression of bcl-x was prominent in the cells of the vasa vasorum in both varicose and healthy veins. PARP expression was diminished in the varicose vein group, with 2.8 +/- 0.7 (P =.01) and 1.4 +/- 0.5 (P =.05) cells per high-power field in the intima and media, respectively. Neither bax nor PARP was noted in the adventitia of varicose veins, although their expression was detected in this layer of the control group (P <.001).\nThe entry of smooth muscle cells into the apoptotic pathway may be regulated by the induction of bax in this model, because there is significant presence of this pro-apoptotic protein in healthy veins. Both bax and PARP are downregulated in varicose veins, as compared with healthy veins, and this may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of varicose veins.",

    "abstract": "The primary event in the procoagulant response after vascular interventions is the tissue factor (TF)-factor VIIa complex formation, which occurs when TF is exposed to the circulating blood by the inflicted trauma. Human recombinant active site-inhibited coagulation factor VIIa (FFR-rFVIIa) binds well to TF but cannot initiate blood coagulation, and should thereby block thrombus formation. This hypothesis was tested with a rat model of arterial thrombosis.\nIn a blinded randomized study, the antithrombotic and antihemostatic effects of FFR-rFVIIa and heparin were evaluated in a rat model of mechanical deep arterial injury. In one arm of the study, FFR-rFVIIa (0.2 mg in 150 microL) or vehicle alone was applied topically at the site of vascular injury. In the other arm, FFR-rFVIIa (4 mg/kg), heparin (1 mg/kg), or vehicle alone was injected intravenously.\nFFR-rFVIIa produced a powerful antithrombotic effect after both topical and intravenous administrations (P =.02 and P =.005, respectively) without increasing the surgical bleeding. Heparin prevented thrombosis equally well as FFR-rFVIIa (P =.0007), but doubled the surgical bleeding compared with FFR-rFVIIa (P =.03) and controls (P =.008). In the topical study, the antithrombotic effect was achieved without altering parameters of plasma anticoagulation (prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time) or producing detectable levels of FFR-rFVIIa in plasma.\nIn this model FFR-rFVIIa effectively inhibits thrombus formation without the expense of increased surgical bleeding, which indicates the potential of FFR-rFVIIa as an effective and safe strategy for prevention of thrombosis in reconstructive vascular surgery and various forms of percutaneous revascularization.",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that both humoral and cellular autoimmune processes directed toward heat shock proteins (hsp) contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We characterized a human hsp distinct from those previously characterized in atherosclerotic lesions, termed HDJ-2.\nTo determine the role of HDJ-2 in atherosclerosis, we compared the level of HDJ-2 mRNA expression with the level of hsp60 and hsp70 mRNA expression in 26 carotid endarterectomy specimens and 17 normal arteries. The level of expression of HDJ-2 mRNA was also correlated to the presence of plaque ulceration and the degree of luminal stenosis associated with the lesion.\nThe expression of HDJ-2 and hsp70 was significantly higher in carotid artery plaques as compared with normal arteries: HDJ-2, 6.7 +/- 1.6 vs 0.1 +/- 0.04, (P =.001); hsp70, 9.5 +/- 0.9 vs 3.7 +/- 0.8, (P =.002). There was no significant difference in hsp60 expression between carotid artery plaques and normal arteries (21.0 +/- 0.9 vs 20.6 +/- 0.8, P =.65). Increased HDJ-2 expression in carotid artery plaques was independent of hsp70 (Pearson correlation, r = 0.11; Bartlett chi(2) analysis, P =.71). Within the ulcerated plaque group, there was a correlation between degree of stenosis and high HDJ-2 mRNA expression (r = 0.896, P =.016).

    "abstract": "Pathologic remodeling of the extracellular matrix is a critical mechanism in the development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are known to alter vascular wall remodeling in other conditions, their effects on AAAs are unknown. In this study we assessed the effect of ACE inhibitors in a rodent model of aneurysm development.\nMale Wistar rats underwent transient aortic perfusion with porcine pancreatic elastase, followed by treatment with one of three ACE inhibitors (captopril [CP], lisinopril [LP], or enalapril [EP]), an angiotensin (AT)1 receptor antagonist (losartan [LOS]), or water alone (9 rats in each group). Blood pressure and aortic diameter (AD) were measured before elastase perfusion and on day 14, with an AAA defined as an increase in AD (DeltaAD) of more than 100%. The structural features of the aortic wall were examined by means of light microscopy.\nAneurysmal dilatation consistently developed within 14 days of elastase perfusion in untreated rats, coinciding with the development of a transmural inflammatory response and destruction of the elastic media (mean DeltaAD, 223% +/- 28%). All three ACE inhibitors prevented AAA development (mean DeltaAD: CP, 67% +/- 4%; LP, 18% +/- 12%; and EP, 14% +/- 3%; each P <.05 vs controls). ACE inhibitors also attenuated the degradation of medial elastin without diminishing the inflammatory response. Surprisingly, the aneurysm-suppressing effects of ACE inhibitors were dissociated from their effects on systemic hemodynamics, and LOS had no significant effect on aneurysm development compared with untreated controls (mean DeltaAD, 186% +/- 19%).\nTreatment with ACE inhibitors suppresses the development of elastase-induced AAAs in the rat. Although this is associated with the preservation of medial elastin, the mechanisms underlying these effects appear to be distinct from hemodynamic alterations alone or events mediated solely by AT1 receptors. Further studies are needed to elucidate how ACE inhibitors influence aortic wall matrix remodeling during aneurysmal degeneration.",

Mean levels of each of the CFV measurements were analyzed with age category, sex, and ethnicity, each adjusted for the other two. Multiple linear regression was used as a means of assessing the independent associations of age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), and height to the CFV measurements.\nThe average CFV diameter at rest was 11.84 mm, increasing to 14.27 mm during the Valsalva maneuver. There was a significant (P <.0001) decline in both diameter measures beginning in patients 60 years old. The CFV diameter was larger in men (12.90 mm) than in women (11.22 mm; P <.0001). The average CFV diameter in Hispanics, Africian Americans, and Asians was significantly smaller (P <.001) than in the non-Hispanic whites in multivarate analysis. The independence of these associations was confirmed by means of multivariate analysis, and positive associations of CFV diameter with height and BMI were documented. The Valsalva response was higher in men than in women (2.67 mm vs 2.29 mm), but the percentage change was similar. CFV velocity at rest decreased significantly (P <.0001) in patients older than 50 years. The mean CFV velocity was 13.87 cm/s, and the values were significantly (P <.0001) higher in women (14.58 cm/s) than in men (12.67 cm/s). In multivariate analysis CFV velocity was higher in African Americans than in the other ethnic groups. We also documented an independent inverse association of CFV with BMI. The CFV velocity response (peak expiration post-Valsalva) increased significantly at all ages, from 52% to 83%. The percentage increase in women (68%) was slightly higher than that in men (58%). African American subjects had a somewhat higher percentage increase (74%) than the other three ethnic groups (63% to 64%). Because the flow rate is determined more by the diameter than the velocity, CFV flow associations were similar to those for diameter. Because an older age predicted both decreased diameter and velocity, the flow reduction with age was pronounced.\nQuantitative normative data that are age-, sex-, and ethnic group-specific are reported on CFV diameter, velocity, and total flow rate, both at rest and with the Valsalva maneuver. CFV diameter, velocity, and flow rate varied significantly as a function of age, sex, ethnicity, height, and BMI. The data also provide a baseline assessment for subsequent evaluations of changes with time in this cohort.",

In this retrospective study we analyzed the technical and clinical outcomes after renal artery stenting in 73 consecutive patients.\nFrom July 1992 to January 1999, 88 Palmaz stents were deployed in 85 renal artery stenoses in 73 patients, with a mean age of 67.9 +/- 9.4 years. Twelve patients (16%) underwent bilateral stent placement. Atheromatous lesions were the most prevalent (99%: 82% ostial, 16% nonostial). Most stents were implanted for suboptimal balloon dilation (52%) or dissection (24%). Mean percent stenosis was 86% +/- 12%. Renal insufficiency (creatinine level > or = 1.5 mg/dL) was present in 50 (68%) patients, and uncontrolled hypertension (systolic > or = 160 mm Hg or diastolic > or = 90 mm Hg with more than two medications) was present in 57 (78%).\nPrimary technical success was achieved in 89%. At the initial procedure, three additional stents were placed for residual stenoses, and urokinase was used to treat one intraprocedural stent thrombosis, resulting in an assisted primary technical success rate of 94%. Major complications occurred in 9.1% of stents placed: access artery thrombosis (n = 4), renal artery extravasation (n = 1), renal artery thrombosis (n = 1), and hematoma requiring operation (n = 2). Long-term clinical data were available on 69 (95%) patients at 20 +/- 17 months. Overall, a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic pressures (P <.001) and reduction of medication (P <.01) were noted without a change in renal function (P = NS). Angiography was performed on 22 patients at 11.3 +/- 10.3 months for persistent or worsening renal function or hypertension or for other reasons; 10 patients had significant restenoses in 14 renal arteries.\nOur retrospective analysis demonstrates that endovascular stenting of renal artery stenosis in patients with poorly controlled hypertension or deteriorating renal function is a safe and effective alternative treatment to surgical management.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral blood pressure measurements play a prominent role in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with peripheral vascular diseases. Toe pressure of the hallux (TP1) and second toe (TP2) and transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TCPO2) measurements are becoming more important. The ankle/brachial pressure index (ABPI) is known to be a reliable parameter, but the toe pressure and TCPO2 are evaluated less thoroughly. Therefore, we evaluated the reproducibility of TP1, TP2, TCPO2, ABPI, ankle pressure (AP), and brachial pressure (BP).\nIn 54 patients with various stages of peripheral vascular disease, the intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of BP, AP, ABPI, TP1, TP2, and TCPO2 was investigated by calculating the repeatability coefficient (RC) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and by using Bland-Altman plots.\nThe intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility at 1 day and after 1 week of BP, AP, ABPI, and TP1 was substantial and comparable (ICC range, 0.80-0.99), except for the BP after 1 week. The TP2 and TCPO2 were less reproducible (ICC range, 0.62-0.98). The interobserver RC of BP was 31 mm Hg; of AP, 44 mm Hg; of ABPI, 27%; of TP1, 41 mm Hg; of TP2, 67 mm Hg; and of TCPO2; 30 mm Hg. The difference plot showed that the observer variability was equally distributed across the range of pressure in all measurements.\nThe BP, AP, ABPI, and TP1 have a substantial intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility, whereas TP2 and TCPO2 show worse reproducibility. Especially when low values (or values around a cutoff value) are measured, the RC should be taken into account, and repetition of the measurement is advocated.",

    "abstract": "Subfascial division of incompetent perforating veins seems to be a successful treatment for patients with venous leg ulceration (CEAP 6). For postoperative wound complications, endoscopic techniques are more common than open subfascial division of incompetent perforating veins (Linton procedure). We investigated the long-term results of ulcer healing and recurrence rates and compared them with preoperative and postoperative duplex findings.\nPatients with venous ulceration on the medial side of the lower leg were randomly allocated to endoscopic exploration or open exploration by means of the modified Linton approach. Ulcer healing and recurrence rates were documented.\nThirty-nine patients were randomly allocated to exploration, 19 patients to open subfascial division of incompetent perforating veins (Linton group), and 20 patients to subfascial endoscopic division of incompetent perforating veins (SEPS group). During the follow-up period, four patients in the SEPS group died, all of causes other than the venous leg ulcer. Because of a squamous cell carcinoma that had developed in the venous ulcer, one patient in the SEPS group underwent a below-knee amputation. In a mean follow-up period of 50.6 months, the venous ulceration of all 18 patients in the Linton group who were available for follow-up initially healed. The recurrence rate in this group was 22% (4 patients). In the SEPS group, the mean follow-up period for 19 patients was 46.1 months, with the ulceration healing in 17 patients and a recurrence rate of 12% (2 patients). The presence of deep venous incompetence (DVI) did not influence the recurrence rates (P =.044, Fisher exact test), but it significantly influenced the development of new incompetent perforating veins (3 of 10 without DVI; 7 of 10 with DVI; P =.011, binomial test).\nThe long-term follow-up results of the endoscopic division of perforating veins are comparable with those of the open division of perforating veins (modified Linton procedure).",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the study was the characterization of a type of rupture occurring on warp-knitted polyester vascular prostheses.\nWe studied 20 cases of warp-knitted polyester vascular prostheses that were explanted from humans that showed a longitudinal rupture as a part of a collaborative retrieval program. All the prostheses were immediately fixed in a 10% formaldehyde solution after their explantation in the operating room. The clinical data of these cases were recorded. The explants were photographed, washed to eliminate the surrounding tissues, and photographed again. The ruptures were characterized with macroscopic examination, optical stereomicroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy.\nThe mean duration of implantation of the prostheses was 16.0 +/- 3.3 years (range, 9-20.7 years). The prostheses were Cooley Double Velour (n = 15) and Microvel Double Velour (n = 5). There were 16 aortobifemoral bypass grafts, 1 aorto-biiliac, 1 aorto-aortic, 1 iliofemoral, and 1 axillobifemoral. The longitudinal ruptures occurred on two specific parts of the prostheses: the guide line (6 cases) and the remeshing line (11 cases). In three cases both lines were affected. Scanning electron microscopy showed major degradation of the trilobar filaments of the velour and gradual ruptures of the flat filaments of the remeshing and guide lines.\nIn this study, we have identified a specific mechanism of late (9-20 years) longitudinal rupture of knitted polyester prostheses consisting of degradation of the polyester filaments along the remeshing and guide lines that run the length of the graft.",

Scanning electron microscopy showed major degradation of the trilobar filaments of the velour and gradual ruptures of the flat filaments of the remeshing and guide lines.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent stenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is often regarded as an optimal application of carotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS). The extended durability of CAS for recurrent carotid artery stenosis after CEA is unknown. We present the intermediate-term surveillance results for all eight CAS procedures performed over a 28-month period at a single tertiary referral center.\nPatients had recurrent carotid stenosis after CEA, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, of 80% to 99% stenosis on preprocedural carotid duplex scan examination. Uncovered, self-expanding metal stents, in conjunction with angioplasty, were used in all patients. Baseline and scheduled interval follow-up duplex ultrasound scan was used to assess intrastent restenosis. Further angiography was reserved for those patients obtaining additional intervention.\nOne transient ischemic attack was observed 1 day after the procedure, and no cerebral infarcts occurred. All patients had angiographic resolution of the stenosis and postprocedural duplex scan studies without residual stenosis. Subsequent interval surveillance duplex scan examinations revealed significant (60%-79%) to critical (80%-99%) recurrent stenosis in six (75%) of eight patients, two of whom went on to further interventions. Of those with intrastent restenosis, four (75%) progressed to critical (80%-99%) stenosis. Mean follow-up was 20.2 months (range, 12-37 months). The two lesions that have not yet shown restenosis are those with the shortest follow-up interval, each at 12 months.\nIn contrast to the optimistic claims in other series, this limited series suggests that angioplasty with stenting for recurrent carotid artery occlusive disease after CEA, although relatively safe in the short term, has significant limitations in terms of durability of results.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed our experience with carotid stenting (CS), focusing on technical evolution and results.\nFrom September 1995 to February 2000, 77 patients with 83 internal (n = 68) and common carotid artery lesions (n = 15) were selected for CS. This patient population was categorized into three consecutive periods based on patient selection, material, and technical skills. For internal carotid artery lesions, period I included 11 patients treated by means of direct carotid puncture with balloon expandable stents; period II included 42 patients treated by means of a femoral approach with self-expandable stents; and period III included 15 patients in whom monorail system and cerebral protection devices were used. Common carotid artery lesions were treated by means of carotid puncture in five patients and by means of a femoral approach in 10 patients. In only two of the latter cases, cerebral protection devices were used.\nThe overall immediate success rate, defined as successfully treated stenosis with no neurological events, was 89.7% for internal carotid artery lesions and 100% for common carotid artery lesions. All neurological events, which consisted of reversible events (4.4%), minor stroke (1.5%), and major stroke (2.9%), occurred during periods I and II. In periods I, II, and III, the rate of surgical conversion was 18%, 9.5%, and 0%, respectively, the rate of transient ischemic attack and reversible ischemic neurologic deficit was 0%, 7%, and 0%, respectively, and the rate of minor and major stroke was 0%, 7%, and 0%, respectively. All major strokes were cleared with intra-arterial thrombolysis. At discharge, the success rates defined by means of the absence of conversion and neurological events were 82% during period I, 76% during period II, and 100% during period III. The freedom from neurological deficits rates were 100%, 97.6%, and 100%, respectively. During follow-up, six significant asymptomatic restenoses were detected with duplex scanning; however, only one patient required reintervention.\nTechnical skills and technological improvement, including low-profile balloon and catheter, cerebral protection device, and intra-arterial rescue techniques, may reduce the rate of neurological events associated with CS. Technical improvements should be given careful consideration before the initiation of randomized trials comparing CS and carotid endarterectomy.",

    "abstract": "A recent overview indicated that although routine patching is safer than routine primary closure after carotid endarterectomy (CEA), there is no systematic evidence that patch type influences outcome. However, most surgeons still believe that prosthetic patches are probably more thrombogenic than vein patches. This study tested the hypothesis that there was no difference in thrombogenicity between the different patch types.\nA total of 274 patients undergoing 276 CEAs were randomized to either Dacron-patch closure (n = 137) or vein-patch closure (n = 139). All patients with an accessible cranial window were monitored for 3 hours postoperatively with transcranial Doppler scanning (TCD). The number of emboli and rate of embolization were quantified with the requirement for selective dextran therapy to control high rates of postoperative embolization. All patients were assessed postoperatively and again at 30 days by a neurologist, and all patients underwent a duplex examination at 30 days.\nThe 30-day death/any stroke rate was 2.2% for patients in the Dacron-patch group and 3.6% for patients in the vein-patch group (P =.72). Patients in the Dacron-patch group had a higher incidence of postoperative emboli (median, 5; interquartile range, 0-10.5) than patients in the vein-patch group (median, 3; interquartile range, 1-17; P =.028). However, the incidence of detecting more than 50 emboli was virtually identical, and patch type had no effect on the incidence of high-rate, sustained embolization that required dextran therapy (5.3% for Dacron, 3.7% for vein). No patient had a carotid thrombosis at 30 days.\nSustained, high-rate embolization, previously shown to be highly predictive of progression to carotid thrombosis, appears to be patient dependent, rather than related to patch type.",

    "abstract": "The management of infected femoral artery pseudoaneurysms (IFAPs) is difficult and controversial. Use of synthetic or autologous conduit during arterial revascularization in these cases is complicated by the presence of sepsis and unavailability of autologous venous conduit. We present the results of common femoral artery (CFA) ligation and local drainage with debridement for the treatment of IFAP.\nA retrospective chart review of six consecutive patients from 1995 to 1999 who presented with IFAP from intravenous drug abuse was performed. Inpatient records, anesthesia records, and outpatient clinic charts were reviewed. All patients were men with right-sided lesions. All six patients abused heroin, and five (83%) abused heroin and cocaine. All six patients had a duplex ultrasound scan, and five (83%) patients had a digital subtraction angiogram to confirm the clinical diagnosis. Proximal vascular control was achieved retroperitoneally through an oblique suprainguinal incision. After vascular isolation and test clamping of the distal external iliac artery (EIA), the pedal pulses were examined with continuous wave Doppler scan. If a Doppler signal was present, this was followed with CFA ligation and local drainage and debridement of the IFAP.\nPain at injection site and fever with chills were present in five (83%) and three (50%) patients, respectively. A pulsatile groin mass and thigh or leg edema were present in five (83%) patients. Three patients (50%) had a palpable pedal pulse, and all six had a Doppler signal over a pedal artery at presentation. The mean white cell count was 15.6 thousand per cubic millimeter (range, 9.2-19.3). All patients had a Doppler signal over a pedal artery after distal EIA/CFA test occlusion and ligation. None of the patients required an amputation, and all six patients regained their preoperative ambulatory status. The mean follow-up period was 25 months. Two patients had mild claudication (5-6 blocks) at 18 months and 2 years after surgery. All six patients received drug rehabilitation, but they admitted to drug abuse after surgery and rehabilitation.\nCFA ligation and local debridement are safe treatment modalities for IFAP, if there is an intraoperative Doppler signal over a pedal artery during test occlusion of the distal EIA/CFA. CFA ligation avoids the use and therefore the risk of synthetic conduit infection, because there is a high incidence of postoperative drug injection despite aggressive drug rehabilitation.",

Anatomic analysis was conducted of two aortoiliac reconstruction operations performed on human cadavers; one was performed according to a single-blind procedure, the second with a modified procedure.\nThe lumbar splanchnic nerves supplying the superior hypogastric plexus from the right side were found to be less voluminous than the left-sided ones. The superior hypogastric plexus was found slightly shifted to the left of the midsagittal plane across the abdominal aorta and its bifurcation. Microscopic analysis revealed a thin fascia between the aorta and the subperitoneal tissue compartment. This fascia was used as a plain of dissection to mobilize the preaortic nerve-plexuses without damage from the aortic wall. Analysis of the specimens operated on showed a significant difference in nerve disruption. The standard procedure caused total disruption of the superior hypogastric plexus and extensive disruption of the inferior mesenteric plexus.

    "abstract": "Antiphospholipid antibodies (APLs), which consist of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLs) or lupus anticoagulant (LA), are associated with venous thrombosis, stroke, and cardiac events. Although they are present in many patients with lower extremity atherosclerotic occlusive disease (LEAOD), the relationship between APL and the progression of LEAOD has not been reported. A comparison of progression of LEAOD as determined with direct imaging studies in patients with and without APL forms the basis for this report.\nAPL+ patients (immunoglobulin M [IgM] or IgA or IgG ACL > 3 SD units above control mean or positive LA) who underwent lower extremity bypass grafting between January 1990 and June 1999 (n = 79) were compared with an APL control group (n = 68). Members of the study and control groups were similar with respect to age, procedure, sex, length of follow-up, and multiple atherosclerosis risk factors. Progression of LEAOD was determined by comparing preoperative arteriograms with postoperative imaging studies (arteriograms or duplex scanning). External iliac, common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal arteries were graded as < 50% stenosis, > or = 50% stenosis, or occluded. Posterior tibial and anterior tibial arteries were graded as patent or occluded. Progression was defined as any increase in stenosis category.\nThe mean follow-up period was 31 months for APL+ and 35 months for APL- patients (P = not significant). Progression of LEAOD occurred in 58 (73%) of 79 APL+ patients and in 25 (37%) of 68 APL- patients (P <.001). There was no difference in progression in external iliac or common femoral arteries. Differences in progression were noted in more distal arteries; APL+ patients had significantly more progression in superficial femoral (45% vs 16%, P <.01), popliteal (31% vs 12%, P <.01), posterior tibial (29% vs 13%, P <.05), and anterior tibial arteries (29% vs 14%, P <.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a significant independent association between the presence of APL and progression of LEAOD (P <.0001).\nIn this study, the presence of APL in patients undergoing lower extremity bypass operations was a significant independent risk factor for progression of LEAOD. We conclude that this patient group should be closely monitored in the postoperative period and appears ideally suited for prospective studies of therapies to modify LEAOD progression.",

    "abstract": "The National Kidney Foundation-Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines favor autogenous vein for arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). This report describes our experience constructing AVFs in the lower extremities of selected patients with the superficial femoral vein (SFV).\nThis is a retrospective analysis of 25 patients who had AVF construction with SFV from March 1998 to July 2000. In all patients upper extremity access had been exhausted. Eighteen (72%) patients were female, 15 (60%) had diabetes, and 14 (56%) were obese (body mass index > 30 kg/m(2)). The SFV was freed from the supragenicular popliteal level to the profunda femoris vein and divided distally. Eighteen (72%) patients had SFV transposition and distal superficial femoral artery reimplantation; 10 veins were banded to reduce the incidence of postoperative steal syndrome. In seven patients (28%) a composite loop fistula was constructed with a deeply buried 4- to 7-mm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft proximally and with superficially transposed SFV distally. One of these seven patients had a PTFE above-knee femoral-popliteal bypass graft with banding of the vein at its takeoff from the distal PTFE graft.\nMean follow-up was 9.1 months. One patient died before the fistula could be used. Seven patients (28%) experienced major wound complications. Mean ankle/brachial index before operation was 1.03, and after operation it was 0.81 (paired difference [n = 16] = -0.26.) Mean ankle circumference before operation was 19.5 cm, and after operation it was 20.7 cm (paired difference [n = 17] = +0.87.) Cumulative primary fistula patency at 6 and 12 months was 78% and 73%, respectively. Cumulative secondary fistula patency at 6 and 12 months was 91% and 86%, respectively. There were no fistula infections. One patient eventually had an above-knee amputation after experiencing an acute compartment syndrome. Eight patients required a second operation to alleviate a symptomatic steal syndrome.\nThe SFV is an excellent conduit for vascular access, whether it is transposed or is part of a composite PTFE-SFV fistula. In this series, fistula infection was nonexistent, thrombosis rates were low, and clinical evidence of venous hypertension was minimal. The major impediment to unrestricted use of SFV in constructing AVFs is a high incidence of clinically significant postoperative ischemia requiring reoperation.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the value of early (< 6 months) duplex scanning after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with an intraoperative completion study with normal results. Attention was paid to restenosis rates and reoperation for recurrent stenosis within the first 6 months.\nA retrospective review was performed on 380 CEAs (338 patients) with intraoperative completion studies and duplex surveillance within the first 6 months. Results of completion studies, restenosis rates, and recurrent symptoms were evaluated for each operation. Studies were performed from 0 to 200 days postoperatively (median, 28).\nIntraoperative completion studies included 333 angiograms, 26 duplex scans, and 21 angiograms with duplex scans. Of the 380 intraoperative completion studies, 28 (7.5%) had abnormal findings, including 14 abnormal internal carotid arteries (ICAs). Twenty-four procedures were revised, and the findings of all repeat completion studies were normal. Of the initial completion studies, in four cases, abnormalities (3 ICAs) were insignificant and did not warrant further intervention. Follow-up ICA duplex scans had normal results after 364 (95.8%) CEAs. There were 14 mild recurrent ICA stenoses and two moderate recurrent ICA stenoses; neither had abnormal findings from the completion study. There were no severe recurrent ICA stenoses. External carotid artery (ECA) recurrent stenosis included 7 mild, 15 moderate, and 9 severe restenoses.\nOnly 0.5% of CEAs developed moderate restenosis. No procedures had severe recurrent stenosis on duplex scan within the first 6 months, and none required intervention. Duplex surveillance in the first 6 months is relatively unproductive, providing that there were normal results from an intraoperative completion study for each patient. Routine surveillance can be started at 1 year.",

Diffuse infrainguinal disease was treated with femoral-distal bypass graft (long; n = 46). Popliteal-distal bypass graft was performed when the inflow femoral artery was not significantly diseased (short; n = 52). Focal SFA stenosis and severe infrageniculate disease were treated with combined IBA of the SFA and distal bypass graft originating from the popliteal artery (combined; n = 12). Follow-up was performed with duplex scan surveillance of both the bypass graft and IBA sites. Treatment groups were compared with life-table analysis.\nThere were no perioperative graft failures or amputations. The perioperative mortality rate was 1% (1 of 110). The 2-year primary patency rates were similar in the three groups: 72% in the long bypass graft group, 82% in the short bypass graft group, and 76% in the combined group (P =.8, log-rank test). SFA IBA sites developed recurrent stenosis in two patients, at 7 and 48 months; both were detected with surveillance and treated with percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty. The overall 5-year rate of primary patency was 63%, secondary patency was 78%, limb salvage was 81%, and survival was 35%. There were no significant differences among the three treatment groups with respect to these outcomes.\nResults with the combined procedure were similar to those achieved with either femoral-distal bypass graft or popliteal-distal bypass graft without SFA IBA. These data suggest that IBA of the inflow SFA may be combined with popliteal to distal bypass graft and that this technique is a reasonable alternative to longer, femoral-origin bypass graft in selected diabetic patients with gangrene.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to review the natural history and clinical outcome of patients with infrainguinal autogenous graft infection (IAGI), to evaluate the effectiveness of attempted graft preservation, to determine those variables associated with graft salvage, and to better determine optimal treatment.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the records of patients undergoing infrageniculate vein grafts at three hospitals between 1994 and 2000 who had a wound infection involving the graft. Clinical and bacteriologic variables were analyzed and correlated with graft salvage, limb salvage, and clinical outcome.\nDuring this 7-year period, 487 patients underwent an infrageniculate vein graft, and 68 (13%) had clinical evidence of IAGI. Twenty-seven patients presented with drainage from the wound, 15 with wound separation and cellulitis, 18 with soft tissue infection extending to the graft, 4 with an abscess and cellulitis, and 4 with bleeding. Ten patients (15%) had systemic symptoms (defined as a white blood cell count > 15,000 and temperature > 38.5 degrees C). Forty infections developed in the thigh, 17 in the groin, and 11 in the lower leg. An anastomosis was exposed in 15 patients. Wound cultures were positive for bacteria in 52 patients, and most infections were due to Staphylococcus aureus (18 patients) and S epidermidis (12 patients). Pseudomonas was cultured from seven infections. Twelve patients had polymicrobial infections. The interval from operation to infection ranged from 7 to 180 days. All patients were treated with oral antibiotics, 48 after intravenous antibiotics. Forty-five patients had operative debridement, including 18 who had muscle flap coverage. Four patients presented with hemorrhage, and three had immediate graft ligation and one graft excision. Follow-up ranged from 5 to 68 months (mean, 24.3 months), with 61 patients currently alive. Two patients died as a result of the IAGI (mortality rate, 2.9%). One had undergone a below-knee amputation, and one had a nonhealed wound but intact limb. Overall, 61 wounds (91%) healed, 4 patients required below-knee amputations, and 3 wounds did not heal. Fifty-eight grafts remained patent, 6 thrombosed, and 4 were ligated to control hemorrhage. Of the 61 wounds that healed, the time required for healing ranged from 7 to 63 days. No patient with bleeding died because of the acute episode. No patient had delayed hemorrhage. All 18 patients treated with a muscle flap healed. Bleeding (P <.001), elevated white blood cell count (P <.029), fever (P <.001), and renal insufficiency (creatinine level > 1.5; P <.056) were the only variables statistically significant in predicting graft failure or limb loss. With the use of life-table analysis, graft patency was 94%, 72%, and 72% at 1, 3, and 5 years, and limb salvage was 97%, 92%, and 92% at the same intervals, respectively.\nMost patients with an IAGI can be successfully treated with graft and limb preservation. In contrast to earlier studies, an exposed anastomosis, interval to infection, or Pseudomonas infection is not associated with graft failure. Graft salvage is less likely in patinets with fever, leukocytosis, and renal insufficency, but because most grafts remained patent, graft preservation is recommended for these patients. Graft ligation or excision should be reserved for patients presenting with bleeding or sepsis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the patterns of injury and the strategies of surgical repair of iatrogenic vascular injuries from a percutaneous vascular suturing device after arterial cannulation.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the clinical experience from an academic vascular surgical practice over a 2-year period. The subjects were patients undergoing vascular repair of iatrogenic vascular injury after deployment of a percutaneous vascular suturing device. Interventions were direct repair of arterial injury (with or without device extraction) or arterial thrombectomy and repair. The main outcome variables included patterns of arterial injury, magnitude of arterial repair, limb salvage, hospital stay, and perioperative mortality and morbidity rates.\nFrom August 1998 through August 2000, eight patients (4 men, 4 women; median age, 55 years; range, 44-80 years) required vascular operations for complications of percutaneous suturing devices after diagnostic (2) or therapeutic (6) arteriograms through a transfemoral approach. Complications included four pseudoaneurysms (1 infected) due to arterial tear from suture pull through, two entrapped closure devices due to device malfunction, and two arterial thromboses due to narrowing/severe intimal dissection. All patients required operative intervention. Direct suture repair with or without device removal was performed in five patients, arterial debridement with vein patch angioplasty in one patient, and arterial thrombectomy and vein patch angioplasty in two patients. There were no perioperative deaths. The median hospital stay was 5 days (range, 2-33). Limbs were salvaged in all patients with a mean follow-up of 4.8 months (range, 1-13).\nAlthough abbreviated postangiography recovery periods and early ambulation have motivated the widespread use of percutaneous suturing devices, the infrequent occurrence of vascular injuries produced by these devices can be significantly more challenging than simple acute pseudoaneurysms or hemorrhage. In addition, thrombotic complications have a small but finite risk of limb loss.",

Complications included four pseudoaneurysms (1 infected) due to arterial tear from suture pull through, two entrapped closure devices due to device malfunction, and two arterial thromboses due to narrowing/severe intimal dissection. All patients required operative intervention. Direct suture repair with or without device removal was performed in five patients, arterial debridement with vein patch angioplasty in one patient, and arterial thrombectomy and vein patch angioplasty in two patients. There were no perioperative deaths. The median hospital stay was 5 days (range, 2-33). Limbs were salvaged in all patients with a mean follow-up of 4.8 months (range, 1-13).",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate our experience with the diagnosis and management of vascular injuries in a group of high-performance athletes.\nBetween June 1994 and June 2000, we treated 26 patients who sustained vascular complications as a result of athletic competition. Clinical presentation, type of athletic competition, location of injury, type of therapy, and degree of rehabilitation were analyzed retrospectively.\nThe mean age of the patients was 23.8 years (range, 17-40). Twenty-one (81%) patients were men, and five (19%) were women. Athletes included 8 major-league baseball players, 7 football players, 2 world-class cyclists, 2 rock climbers, 2 wind surfers, 1 swimmer, 1 kayaker, 1 weight lifter, 1 marksman, and 1 volleyball player. There were 14 (54%) arterial and 12 (46%) venous complications. Arterial injuries included 7 (50%) axillary/subclavian artery or branch artery aneurysms with secondary embolization, 6 (43%) popliteal artery injuries, and 1 (7%) case of intimal hyperplasia and stenosis involving the external iliac artery. Subclavian vein thrombosis (SVT) accounted for all venous complications. Five of the seven patients with axillary/subclavian branch artery aneurysms required lytic therapy for distal emboli, and six required operative intervention. All popliteal artery injuries were treated by femoropopliteal bypass graft with autogenous saphenous vein. The external iliac artery lesion, which occurred in a cyclist, was repaired with limited resection and vein patch angioplasty. All 12 patients with SVT were treated initially with lytic therapy and anticoagulation. Eight patients required thoracic outlet decompression and venolysis of the subclavian vein. Thirteen arterial reconstructions have remained patent at an average follow-up of 31.9 months (range, 2-74). One patient with a popliteal artery injury required reoperation at 2 months for occlusion of his bypass graft. Eleven of the patients with an arterial injury were able to return to their prior level of competition. All of the patients with SVT have remained stable without further venous thrombosis and have returned to their usual level of activity.\nAthletes are susceptible to a variety of vascular injuries that may not be easily recognized. A high level of suspicion, a thorough workup including noninvasive studies and arteriography/venography, and prompt treatment are important for a successful outcome.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to analyze a single-center experience in which descending thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) were treated with a new self-expanding endovascular prosthesis (Medtronic AVE).\nTwenty-six patients (13 men, 13 women) with American Society of Anesthesiology grades II to IV and ages ranging from 53 to 92 years (average, 74 years) consented as part of a Phase I Food and Drug Administration-approved trial. Treated lesions included TAAs that were 5 to 10 cm in diameter, 12 diffuse dilations or fusiform aneurysms, and four saccular aneurysms. There were also nine chronic dissections (2 aneurysmal dilations and 7 symptomatic acute recurrent dissections). Three patients (2 with diffuse/fusiform and 1 with dissection) presented with hemothorax, contrast extravasation, or both.\nTwenty-five of the 26 patients who consented (96% technical success) were treated successfully with no surgical conversions. Eighteen patients have been followed up from 1 to 22 months (average, 9 months). One patient is lost to follow-up, and six patients have died (24%). One procedure-related death (4%) occurred within the 30-day postoperative period and was caused by diffuse embolization. There were no device-related deaths. Five additional patients (20%) have died during the study of comorbid conditions. Complications included one massive myocardial infarction 24 hours after the procedure requiring balloon counterpulsation and long-term dialysis, one cardiac tamponade resulting from central line placement before the procedure, one progression of aneurysm dilation proximal to the device at 1 year, and one bilateral lower extremity paralysis occurring 12 hours after successful deployment. Seven patients (5 women) had femoral artery reconstructions or iliac artery grafts to repair injuries during deployment catheter passage. Other significant parameters included average procedure time (2 hours 40 minutes; range, 1 hour 30 minutes to 5 hours 30 minutes), 450 cc average blood loss (n = 25; 100-3000 cc) being replaced by means of autotransfusion with only two patients receiving banked blood products, and an average 2 days to resumption of normal diet, 1 day in the intensive care unit, and 5 days' hospitalization postprocedure in uncomplicated cases (n = 22). One patient had an endoleak immediately after the procedure that sealed without treatment. Follow-up of all patients ranging from 1 to 22 months (average, 9 months; n = 18) demonstrates continued exclusion of the aneurysm with no endoleaks and either stable or decreasing aneurysm volume, except in one patient with volume increase and no obvious etiology who continues to be investigated.\nThe study suggests that endovascular prosthesis exclusion of TAAs with an AneuRx self-expanding tubular device may be effective in many patients who are at significant risk for open surgical repair and substantiates further clinical investigation to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term functional outcome after unilateral hypogastric artery occlusion during endovascular stent graft repair of aortoiliac aneurysms.\nDuring a 41-month period, 157 consecutive patients underwent elective endovascular stent graft repair of aortoiliac aneurysms with the Medtronic AneuRx device. Postoperative computed tomography scans were compared with preoperative scans to identify new hypogastric artery occlusions. Twenty-three (15%) patients had unilateral hypogastric occlusion, and there were no cases of bilateral occlusions. Telephone interviews about past and current levels of activity and symptoms were conducted, and pertinent medical records were reviewed. All 23 (100%) patients were available for the telephone interview. A disability score (DS) was quantitatively graded on a discrete scale ranging from 0 to 10 corresponding to \"virtually bed-bound\" to \"greater-than-a-mile\" exercise tolerance. Worsening or improvement of symptoms was expressed as a difference in DS between two time points (-, worsening/+, improving).\nAmong the 23 patients, two groups were identified: 10 patients (43%) had planned and 13 patients (57%) had unplanned or inadvertent occlusions. The patients in the two groups did not differ significantly in the mean age (73.4 vs 73.7 years), sex (male:female, 9:1 vs 10:3), and duration of follow-up (15.6 vs 14.4 months). Nine (39%) of the 23 patients, five patients in the planned and four patients in the unplanned group, reported significant symptoms of hip and buttock claudication ipsilateral to their occluded hypogastric arteries. The mean decrement from baseline of these nine patients in their DS postoperatively was -3.3. The symptoms were universally noted on postoperative day 1. Although most patients improved (89%), one (11%) never got better. Among those whose symptoms improved, the mean time to improvement was 15 weeks, but with a plateau thereafter resulting in a net decrement of DS of -2.3 from baseline. Finally, when questioned whether they would undergo the procedure again, all 23 patients unanimously answered, \"Yes.\"\nA significant number (39%) of patients who sustain hypogastric artery occlusion after endovascular aneurysm repair have symptoms. Although most patients with symptoms have some improvement, none return to their baseline level of activity.

    "abstract": "Detailed information on functional outcome after open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is sparse. Information about functional outcome of open AAA repair is essential to allow comparison of treatment modalities.\nTo determine the functional outcome of patients after open repair of AAA, we reviewed 154 consecutive, nonemergency open repairs of infrarenal AAAs between 1990 and 1997 and each patient's medical records. Clinical variables were recorded for each patient, as were multiple outcomes, including ambulatory status, independent living status, current medical condition, and the patient's perception of recovery and satisfaction. Eighty-seven patients or their families were available for current telephone interview to obtain information about objective functional activities, including walking and driving, and subjective functional information, including assessment of complete recovery and willingness to undergo AAA repair again. Chart data were available for all 154 patients.\nThere were 42 women and 112 men. A total of 139 operations were elective, and 15 were urgent. The operative mortality rate was 4%, mean hospital stay was 10.7 +/- 1.3 days, and mean intensive care unit stay was 4.57 +/- 1.17 days. Seventeen (11%) patients required transfer to a skilled nursing facility with a mean stay of 3.66 +/- 2.9 months. All patients were ambulatory preoperatively, whereas at last follow-up (median, 25 months; range, 0.13-108.5 months), 100 (64%) of the patients remained ambulatory, 34 (22%) required assistance, and 12 (14%) were nonambulatory. At current assessment by telephone interview, 33% of patients described a decrease in their functional activity including driving, shopping, and traveling compared with their preoperative status, whereas 67% were unchanged. When asked to assess their own degree of recovery, 64% of patients stated that they experienced complete recovery with an average time to recovery of 3.9 months, whereas 33% said they had not fully recovered at a mean follow-up of 34 months. Sixteen (18%) patients said they would not undergo AAA repair again knowing the recovery process, even though they appeared to fully understand the implication of AAA rupture.\nPatients undergoing open AAA repair generally experienced significant freedom from surgical complications. However, substantial functional impairment was present. It is unclear whether the functional disability resulted from the AAA surgery or from aging and comorbidities unrelated to surgery.",

    "abstract": "Elastin and collagen (types I and III) are the primary load-bearing elements in aortic tissue. Deficiencies and derangements in elastin and type III collagen have been associated with the development of aneurysmal disease. However, the role of type I collagen is less well defined. The purpose of this study was to define the role of type I collagen in maintaining biomechanical integrity in the thoracic aorta, with a mouse model that produces homotrimeric type I collagen [alpha1(I)]3, rather than the normally present heterotrimeric [alpha1(I)]2 alpha2(I) type I collagen isotype.\nAscending and descending thoracic aortas from homozygous (oim/oim ), heterozygous (oim /+), and wildtype (+/+) mice were harvested. Circumferential and longitudinal load-extension curves were used as a means of determining maximum breaking strength (Fmax) and incremental elastic modulus (IEM). Histologic analyses and hydroxyproline assays were performed as a means of determining collagen organization and content.\nCircumferentially, the ascending and descending aortas of oim /oim mice demonstrated significantly reduced Fmax, with an Fmax of only 60% and 23%, respectively, of wildtype mice aortas. Oim/oim descending aortas demonstrated significantly greater compliance (decreased IEM), and the ascending aortas also exhibited a trend toward increased compliance. Reduced breaking strength was also demonstrated with longitudinal extension of the descending aorta.\nThe presence of homotrimeric type I collagen isotype (absence of alpha2(I) collagen) significantly weakens the aorta. This study demonstrates the integral role of type I collagen in the biomechanical and functional properties of the aorta and may help to elucidate the role of collagen in the development of aneurysmal aortic disease or dissection.",

    "abstract": "Research investigating abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) commonly uses a rat model dependent on aortic infusion of porcine pancreatic elastase to initiate AAA formation. Unfortunately, the sizes of AAAs generated by this model have varied widely among published studies. This may reflect lot-to-lot variations in commercial elastase preparations. This study was undertaken to investigate the ability of different lots of elastase to induce AAAs and explain the variability identified.\nFour lots of elastase were evaluated in the standard rat AAA model. Saline solution was used as a control. Additional groups of rats were treated with higher concentrations of elastase with or without the macrophage activator thioglycollate medium. Aortic diameters were measured in all rats. Inflammation and elastin degradation was examined histologically. Elastase activity and purity were evaluated for all lots.\nOf the four lots tested, only one was able to consistently generate AAAs at the standard dose (P <.05). Increasing the amount of elastase infused produced AAAs in some ineffective lots. Infusion of thioglycollate medium in combination with otherwise ineffective elastase produced AAAs (P =.02). However, the elastase with the highest purity failed to generate AAAs, even at the highest dose tested or in combination with thyioglycollate medium. Thioglycollate medium alone failed to result in AAA formation. All elastase lots displayed elastolytic activity in vitro and produced elastin degradation in vivo. Elastin degradation did not correlate with AAA size in elastase-treated rats (P = NS). Aneurysm size correlated with extent of inflammation (P =.005).\nInduction of AAAs does not correlate with elastolytic activity. Infusion of pure elastase alone is not sufficient to induce AAA formation in spite of evidence of elastin degradation. Presumed inflammatory modifiers, which contaminate some elastase preparations, enhance AAA formation. Future use of this rat model will need to take the variability of elastase preparations into account with controls for each new elastase lot.",

    "abstract": "Deendothelialization of injuries of the artery disrupts normal vascular homeostasis, affecting both the structural integrity of the blood vessel wall, as well as the interaction of the arterial surface with blood components such as platelets, leukocytes, and circulating proteins. Leukocyte and, in particular, monocyte recruitment to damaged vessels has been implicated in the pathogenesis of intimal hyperplasia. We hypothesize that reendothelialization is an important modulator of monocyte adhesion to healing arterial surfaces.\nNew Zealand white rabbits (n = 20) were subjected to bilateral iliofemoral artery balloon injury. Cultured, autologous venous endothelial cells (ECs) were immediately seeded onto one vessel, whereas the contralateral artery received medium alone, to accelerate endothelial relining. Vessels were harvested (5-9 days after injury) for analysis of permeability (Evans Blue dye exclusion), endothelial coverage (anti-CD31 immunohistochemistry), monocyte adhesion (ex vivo binding of 51Na2CrO4-labeled monocytic THP-1 cells), and monocyte recruitment (RAM-11 immunohistochemistry).\nImproved EC coverage was evidenced by positive staining for CD31 in the seeded vessels. Vessel wall permeability was markedly reduced in EC-seeded arteries (29% +/- 10% vs 99% +/- 0% surface Evans blue staining, P <.005), consistent with restoration of a functional endothelial barrier. EC seeding significantly reduced ex vivo THP-1 binding to vessels explanted at a mean of 8 days after injury (45,170 +/- 8939 vs 85,994 +/- 16,500 cells/cm2, P <.05). However, RAM-11 staining revealed no significant difference in overall macrophage accumulation between seeded and control vessels 1 week after injury (111 +/- 22 vs 95 +/- 14 cells/section, P =.36).\nImmediate seeding of a balloon-injured rabbit artery with cultured ECs results in accelerated restoration of the endothelial lining. At 1 week, barrier function is improved, and the seeded vessel surface is less adhesive to activated monocytes ex vivo, as compared with injured controls. Nonetheless, EC-seeded and nonseeded arteries demonstrate similar total macrophage accumulation over 1 week. These data suggest that after mechanical arterial injury, endothelial coverage may be one important variable influencing leukocyte adhesion.",

    "abstract": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is the most potent known vasoconstrictor. Elevated plasma levels have been demonstrated in patients with myocardial infarction, cardiogenic and septic shock, and respiratory, heart, and kidney failure, as well as in those undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. However, endothelin levels have not previously been examined in patients undergoing repair of ruptured AAA. We hypothesized that hemorrhagic shock, lower torso ischemia, and reperfusion associated with ruptured AAA repair lead to increased synthesis and secretion of ET-1, which, in turn, predispose to organ failure, one of the principal causes of death in this condition.\nFourteen patients were studied. Plasma levels of big ET-1 and ET-1 were measured immediately before operation and immediately before, 5 minutes, and 6 hours after aortic clamp release.\nAll patients survived for at least 24 hours after operation. Big ET-1 levels were above the normal range at one or more sample points in all patients, and the ET-1 levels were above the normal range in all survivors and four of five nonsurvivors. Five patients who died of organ failure had significantly lower big ET-1 levels at all sample points and significantly lower ET-1 levels after 5 minutes of reperfusion when compared with survivors. Preoperative ET-1 levels were significantly lower in eight patients who subsequently developed kidney failure than in six patients who did not.\nContrary to our original hypothesis, these novel data demonstrate that patients with ruptured AAA in whom fatal postoperative organ failure develops have significantly lower perioperative endothelin levels than survivors.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblasts (fb) play an important role in wound healing involving motility, contraction, fibrosis, and expression of the cytoskeletal protein alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-sma). Patients with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) are known to have dermal changes and impaired venous ulcer healing. To investigate whether these dermal-fb have an altered ability to migrate and whether chronic wound fluid from venous ulcers alters neonatal fb motility, we examined cell migration and alpha-sma.\nFibroblasts were cultured from the margin of venous ulcers (du-fb, n = 4, CEAP 6), from patients with venous reflux without ulcer (dr-fb, n = 5, CEAP 2), and from the ipsilateral thigh of the same patients with (pu-fb) and without (pr-fb) ulcer, respectively. The abbreviations used are p and d, which represent proximal and distal, respectively; u and r represent ulcer and reflux, respectively. Neonatal foreskin fibroblasts (nf-fb) were exposed to chronic venous ulcer wound fluid (CVUWF, 300 microg protein/mL, n = 3) or bovine serum albumin (BSA, control). Fibroblast motility was determined by means of time-lapse photo-images, and the rate (micrometer per hour) was calculated. Immunohistochemistry for alpha-sma was analyzed with confocal laser microscopy.\nThe rate of motility (micrometer per hour +/- SEM) was decreased for both du-fb (11.4 +/- 0.7) and dr-fb (13.8 +/- 0.6), when compared with pu-fb (21.9 +/- 0.9) and pr-fb (24.7 +/- 1.1), respectively. The motility rate for nf-fb was lower in CVUWF (24.7 +/- 2.0) than in BSA (37.1 +/- 6.7). An elevated level of microfilament bundles of alpha-sma for both du-fb and dr-fb, compared with those of pu-fb and pr-fb, and also in nf-fb treated with CVUWF was demonstrated by means of immunohistochemistry.\nThese data demonstrate a reduced motility in the dermal fb of patients with CVI. Patients with reflux disease without ulcer are predisposed to these changes. Furthermore, it appears that CVUWF causes changes in motility and alpha-sma expression in nf-fb as demonstrated in du-fb. These findings suggest that reduced motility and CVUWF, representing the microenvironment of venous ulcers, play a significant role in impaired wound healing.",

    "abstract": "We sought to define the learning curve relative to the incidence and range of intraoperative problems and to establish guidelines for troubleshooting during the endovascular repair of infrarenal aortic aneurysms.\nWe prospectively evaluated our first 75 consecutive cases over a 12-month period and focused on perioperative critical events and adjunctive procedures as categorical outcome measures collected during the operation. Patients were separated into three groups on the basis of the date of their operation, such that group 1 consisted of our first 25 cases, group 2 our next 25 cases, and group 3 our last 25 cases.\nAt least one critical event and adjunctive procedure marked 67 (89%) of 75 cases. In 51%, there were at least two critical events and adjunctive procedures. There were no immediate open conversions or intraoperative deaths. Access problems occurred in 28% of the 75 cases and were addressed by use of brachial-femoral artery access (30%), iliac artery/aortic bifurcation balloon angioplasty (8%), and iliofemoral conduits (4%). Graft foreshortening was the most common deployment event (44%), necessitating distal covered extensions. Iliac graft limb twists and kinks occurred in 12% of cases and were managed with balloon angioplasty and uncovered stents. General incidents included balloon ruptures (10%), arterial dissections (6%), iliac artery rupture (2.6%), and lower extremity ischemia (4%). The two cases of iliac artery rupture were managed with distal covered extensions, and there were no cases of atheroemboli. Intraoperative endoleaks were encountered in 44% of the cases and included proximal attachment sites (15%), distal attachment sites (9%), type 2 sources, and \"blushes.\" Management of intraoperative endoleaks included proximal/distal covered extensions and re-ballooning. Our 30-day endoleak rate was 20%. The incidence of critical events did not decrease in the latter one third compared with the first two thirds of cases.\nCritical events occur frequently during endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms. The intraoperative problems range from the common endoleaks, access and deployment issues, and balloon ruptures, to rare but life-threatening complications such as iliac artery rupture. A toolbox of accessories that includes wires, catheters, large balloons, covered proximal and distal extensions, and uncovered stents is essential given the frequency of adjunctive procedures. Successful aortic endografting requires more than mere familiarity with basic endovascular techniques.",

    "abstract": "Premature cellular senescence has been linked to venous hypertension and may contribute to delayed healing of venous ulcers. We hypothesized that the percentage of senescent cells in in vitro populations of fibroblasts isolated from venous ulcers is directly related to the clinical time-to-healing.\nBiopsy specimens were obtained from ulcer margins and unaffected dermal tissue of the ipsilateral thigh of seven patients with active venous ulcers. Using explant culture techniques, we obtained populations of wound fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts. The percentage of senescence in these cell populations was determined with X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-D-galactoside), which was used as a stain for B-galactosidase, a biomarker for senescent dermal fibroblasts. The X-Gal stain is a peroxidase stain for B-galactosidase. All patients in the study were treated with compression dressings. On a weekly basis, digital images were taken until ulcers healed. Planimetric healing rates were calculated from these images, and an overall time-to-healing was recorded. All cytologic investigations were performed on first passage cells.\nThe average starting ulcer size was 4.2 cm2. Five of the data points represented healed ulcers. The two remaining patients withdrew from the study to pursue other therapies after having been treated with compression dressings for a long time. Linear regression analysis of healed ulcers identified a relationship between percent of senescence and time-to-healing, which was statistically significant (R2 = 0.81, P =.037). High percentages of senescent cells also had a correlation with slowed planimetric healing, which was not statistically significant.\nThis study demonstrates a clinical correlation between quantitative in vitro senescence and time-to-healing. A percentage of senescence that is greater than 15% in populations of cells isolated from venous ulcers may identify a \"difficult to heal\" ulcer. There is no good clinical indicator for determining the likelihood of ulcer healing, but these results indicate that senescence percentage may have potential in this regard.",

Linear regression analysis of healed ulcers identified a relationship between percent of senescence and time-to-healing, which was statistically significant (R2 = 0.81, P =.037). High percentages of senescent cells also had a correlation with slowed planimetric healing, which was not statistically significant.",

    "abstract": "Evidence exists that an ideal bypass conduit should have a functional endothelial cell surface combined with mechanical properties similar to those of native arteries. We hypothesized that the effect of combined arterial levels of pulsatile shear stress, flow, and cyclic strain would enhance saphenous venous endothelial cell nitric oxide (NO) production, and that variations in these \"ideal\" conditions could impair this function. We studied NO production as a measure of endothelial function in response to different hemodynamic conditions.\nHuman adult saphenous venous endothelial cells were cultured in 10-cm silicone tubes, similar in diameter (5 mm) and compliance (6%) to a medium-caliber peripheral artery (eg, popliteal). Tube cultures were exposed to arterial conditions: a combined pressure (120/80 mm/Hg; mean, 100 mm/Hg), flow (mean, 115 mL/min) and cyclic strain (2%), with a resultant pulsatile shear stress of 4.8 to 9.4 dyne/cm2 (mean, 7.1). Identical tube cultures were used to study variations in these conditions. Modifications of the system included a noncompliant system, a model with nonpulsatile flow, and a final group exposed to pulsatile pressure with no flow. NO levels were measured with a fluorometric nitrite assay of conditioned media collected at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours. Experimental groups were compared with cells exposed to nonpulsatile, nonpressurized low flow (shear stress 0.1 dyne/cm2) and static cultures.\nAll experimental groups had greater rates of NO production than cells under static conditions (P <.05). Cells exposed to ideal conditions produced the greatest levels of NO. Independent decreases in compliance, flow, and pulsatility resulted in significantly lower rates of NO production than those in the group with these conditions intact (vs noncompliant P <.05, vs nonflow P <.05, and vs nonpulsatile P <.05).\nOur results show that in the absence of physiologically normal pulsatility, cyclic strain, and volume flow, endothelial NO production does not reach the levels seen under ideal conditions. Pulsatile flow and compliance (producing flow with cyclic stretch) play a key role in NO production by vascular endothelium in a three-dimensional hemodynamically active model. This correlates biologically with clinical experience linking graft inflow and runoff and the mechanical properties of the conduit to long-term patency.",

    "abstract": "Iliac artery anatomy is a central factor in endoluminal abdominal aortic aneurysm therapy. It serves as the conduit for graft deployment and as the region of distal graft seal. Thirty-eight percent of iliac vessels in our patients require special treatment because of aneurysms, tortuosity, or small size. Bilateral hypogastric artery exclusion has been avoided because of concerns of colorectal ischemia, hip/buttock claudication, and impotence. We suggest that elective, staged, bilateral hypogastric embolization can be performed safely with reasonably low morbidity and can expand the anatomic boundaries for stent-graft abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.\nThis study was performed as a retrospective chart review of patients requiring hypogastric artery embolization for endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms between June 1998 and June 2000. Patients with otherwise appropriate anatomy and common iliac artery aneurysms were informed of the option for stent-graft repair with internal iliac artery embolization with its risks of impotence, hip/buttock claudication, and bowel ischemia. Patients underwent unilateral or staged bilateral coil embolizations of their proximal hypogastric arteries with an approximate 1-week interval between procedures. Hospital and office records were reviewed; phone interviews were performed. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 12 months.\nDuring a 24-month period, 65 patients underwent endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair; 18 patients (28%) required hypogastric artery embolization. Seven (39%) of these patients underwent bilateral embolization. There were no episodes of clinically evident bowel ischemia. Lactate levels were normal in all measured patients. Postoperative fevers (> 101.0 degrees F) were documented in 10 (56%) of 18 patients. The average white blood cell count was 12.8 x 10(9)/L (range, 8.5-22.9). There were no positive blood culture results. The return to the full preoperative diet occurred in 1 to 3 days. Hip/buttock claudication occurred in approximately 50% of patients with persistent but improved symptoms at 6 months. Eighty-seven percent of patients had preoperative erectile dysfunction. Only two patients noted worsening of erectile function postoperatively.\nPreliminary results indicate that bilateral hypogastric artery embolization can be performed, when necessary, with reasonable morbidity in patients undergoing stent-graft abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.",

    "abstract": "In an earlier report, we documented the incidence and impact of aortic branch compromise complicating acute aortic dissection (AD) over a 21-year interval (1965-1986). In the current study, management of peripheral vascular complications (PVCs) of AD over the past decade was reviewed.\nMedical records of patients treated for AD over the interval January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1999, were reviewed. Patients with branch compromise confirmed with radiography or operation and patients with spinal cord ischemia that was based on results of a physical examination defined the study group. Comparisons between subgroups with and without PVC over a 30-year interval were analyzed with the chi(2) test.\nA total of 187 patients (101 proximal and 86 distal) were treated for AD over the study interval. A total of 53 (28%) of these patients had clinical evidence of organ or limb malperfusion (7 cerebral, 3 upper extremity, 5 spinal cord, 11 mesenteric, 12 renal, and 24 lower extremity [sites inclusive]), and one of three (17 patients) of these underwent specific peripheral vascular intervention. The remaining 65% (36) of the PVC group had complete or partial malperfusion resolution after central aortic therapy (medical or surgical) alone. Open techniques for treating PVC included aortic fenestration (9), femorofemoral grafting (2), and aortofemoral grafting (1). All had favorable outcomes with no mortality. Endovascular procedures in five patients included abdominal aortic fenestration (3) or stenting of the renal (2), mesenteric (2), and iliac (1) arteries with clinical success in three patients and two deaths. The in-hospital mortality rate for the entire group of 187 patients was 18% (15% for proximal aortic operation, 8% in medically treated patients). The presence of aortic branch compromise was not a statistically significant predictor of the patient mortality rate (23% with and 16% without; P =.26). Overall mortality rate in the current study (18% vs 37%; P =.000006) and the mortality rate with PVC (23% vs 51%; P =.001), in particular with mesenteric ischemia (36% vs 87%; P =.026), decreased significantly when compared with prior experience.\nThe overall mortality rate from AD during the past decade has decreased significantly. Similar trends were noted in patients with PVCs, a previously identified high-risk subgroup. Increased awareness and prompt, specific management of PVCs, in particular when visceral ischemia is present, have contributed to improved outcomes in patients with AD.",

    "abstract": "The optimal management of patients with significant coronary and carotid artery disease remains controversial. Since reporting on a series of 100 patients undergoing combined carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass (CEA/CAB) 4 years ago, we have liberalized our selection criteria for combined operation. We sought to compare outcomes of the recent cohort of 74 patients and the previous group.\nAll patients who underwent CEA/CAB since 1984 have been tracked in a database containing identifying information, demographic factors, anatomic information, details of surgery, and short- and long-term follow-up data. We compared the 74 patients (Group 2) undergoing CEA/CAB since 1994 with the previously reported group of 100 patients (Group 1) who underwent CEA/CAB between 1984 and 1994. We examined demographic and comorbidity factors, presence of cerebrovascular symptoms, degree of contralateral carotid stenosis, and perioperative stroke and death. Statistical comparisons were made with the chi(2) test.\nThe groups had similar age and sex distributions and similar incidences of hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, prior myocardial infarction, and hypercholesterolemia. More patients in Group 1 had preoperative transient cerebral ischemia or monocular blindness (55% vs 31%, P <.002) and preoperative stroke (18% vs 7%, P <.03). More patients in Group 2 had unilateral asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (55% vs 18%, P <.001). The incidence of all perioperative strokes was higher in Group 1 (9% vs 1.4%, P <.035). There were fewer deaths (3% vs 8%) and ipsilateral strokes (0 vs 4%) in Group 2, though these were not statistically significant.\nWe have liberalized our criteria for performing combined CEA/CAB, such that more than 50% of our recent patients have asymptomatic unilateral carotid stenosis. This practice is associated with a lower incidence of all perioperative strokes and a trend toward lower ipsilateral stroke and death. These observations suggest that perioperative stroke after CEA/CAB is related to patient selection and that low-risk patients can undergo CEA/CAB with the benefits of low morbidity, patient convenience, and cost savings from avoiding a second hospitalization and operation.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to examine recent trends in the outcomes of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing infrainguinal bypass grafting (IBG) with autogenous vein.\nA retrospective analysis of all IBGs performed on patients with ESRD at a single tertiary care institution during the interval 1993 to 1999 was undertaken. The comparison groups consisted of concurrent series of patients with elevated creatinine (creatinine level > 1.2 mg/dL) and patients with normal renal function undergoing IBG. Procedural variables, angiographic runoff scores, and extent of tissue necrosis at presentation were correlated with outcome. Categoric parameters were compared with chi(2) analysis; rates were computed with life-table analysis.\nOf an overall cohort of 622 IBGs performed during this interval, 78 IBGs (12.5%) were performed on 60 patients with ESRD, with a perioperative mortality rate of 1.3% that was comparable to controls. All reconstructions in the ESRD cohort were for limb salvage indications. Four-year survival, primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates for the ESRD group were 51% +/- 9%, 60% +/- 11%, 86% +/- 5%, and 86% +/- 5%, respectively; these were not statistically different from the control groups. Limb salvage in the ESRD group was 77% +/- 6% at 4 years and was significantly less then either the elevated creatinine (92% +/- 4%; P <.02) or the normal renal function group (90% +/- 2%: P <.02). Of 16 amputations in the ESRD group, nine were performed in limbs with patent grafts. The only absolute predictor of limb loss despite a patent graft was the presence of a heel ulcer more than 4 cm in diameter. Age, runoff score of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery/Society for Vascular Surgery, isolated tibial bypass graft, and location of distal anastomosis were not predictive of hemodynamic failure.\nPatients with ESRD constitute an increasing proportion of patients undergoing IBG in a tertiary care setting. Four-year survival, perioperative mortality, and graft patency rates are similar to patients with normal renal function and support an aggressive approach to this population. Major limb amputation despite a patent graft remains a problem of unique frequency in patients with ESRD. Adequate predictors of hemodynamic failure of IBG in this group do not exist, although a heel ulcer more than 4 cm may indicate an unsalvageable foot.",

All reconstructions in the ESRD cohort were for limb salvage indications. Four-year survival, primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates for the ESRD group were 51% +/- 9%, 60% +/- 11%, 86% +/- 5%, and 86% +/- 5%, respectively; these were not statistically different from the control groups. Limb salvage in the ESRD group was 77% +/- 6% at 4 years and was significantly less then either the elevated creatinine (92% +/- 4%; P <.02) or the normal renal function group (90% +/- 2%: P <.02). Of 16 amputations in the ESRD group, nine were performed in limbs with patent grafts. The only absolute predictor of limb loss despite a patent graft was the presence of a heel ulcer more than 4 cm in diameter. Age, runoff score of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery/Society for Vascular Surgery, isolated tibial bypass graft, and location of distal anastomosis were not predictive of hemodynamic failure.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports have both advocated and questioned the utility of duplex arteriography (DA) as the sole preoperative imaging modality for planning infragenicular revascularization. This study compares the outcome of patients with critical limb ischemia who underwent infragenicular vein grafts on the basis of DA alone versus conventional preoperative contrast arteriography (CA).\nThe study group is composed of 23 consecutive patients who underwent infragenicular vein bypass grafting solely on the basis of preoperative DA from 1998 to 1999. They were compared with 50 consecutive patients who underwent infragenicular vein bypass grafting after CA from 1996 to 1998. Peak systolic velocity and end-diastolic velocity of potential target arteries were recorded during DA studies. In situ saphenous vein grafts were used preferentially, and technical adequacy of all grafts was assessed with completion duplex or arteriography.\nDA and CA groups were comparable on the basis of age and risk factors. In one limb (4%), the target artery selected by DA was abandoned because of dense calcification. No other revision in target or inflow artery was required on the basis of intraoperative completion studies. At 1 year, primary graft patency (78% vs 70%, P =.72) and limb salvage (70% vs 81%, P =.21) were comparable between the two groups. In the DA group, mean preoperative target artery peak systolic velocity in patent versus failed grafts was 49 +/- 18 cm/s versus 31 +/- 9 cm/s (P =.04), whereas mean end-diastolic velocity was 22 +/- 7 cm/s versus 14 +/- 8 cm/s (P =.08).\nInfragenicular revascularization directed by DA alone provides early graft patency and limb salvage rates comparable to similar procedures that are based on CA. Preoperative DA target artery velocities may predict outcome and improve target selection. These initial results justify further clinical testing of DA as the primary imaging modality for planning infragenicular vein grafts.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of treatment of patients with combined arterial and venous insufficiency (CAVI), evaluate variables associated with successful ulcer healing, and better define criteria for interventional therapy.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the records of patients treated at four institutions from 1995 to 2000 with lower extremity ulcers and CAVI. Arterial disease was defined as an ankle/brachial index less than 0.9, absent pedal pulse, and at least one in-line arterial stenosis > 50% by arteriography. Venous insufficiency was defined as characteristic clinical findings and duplex findings of either reflux or thrombus in the deep or superficial system. Clinical, demographic, and hemodynamic parameters were statistically analyzed with multiple regression analysis and correlated with ulcer healing and limb salvage.\nFifty-nine patients with CAVI were treated for nonhealing ulcers that had been present from 1 to 39 months (mean, 6.4 months). All patients had edema. The mean ankle/brachial index was 0.55 (range, 0-0.86). Treatment included elastic compression and leg elevation in all patients and greater saphenous vein stripping in patients with superficial venous reflux. Fifty-two patients underwent arterial bypass grafting, three underwent an endarterectomy, one underwent superficial femoral artery percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, and three underwent primary below-knee amputation. For purposes of analysis, patients were divided into four groups according to the pattern of arterial and venous disease and the success of arterial reconstruction. Group 1 consisted of 22 patients with a patent arterial graft, superficial venous incompetence, and normal deep veins. Group 2 consisted of seven patients with a patent graft, superficial reflux, and deep venous reflux. Group 3 included 22 patients with a patent graft and deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and group 4 included eight patients with an occluded arterial graft. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 47 months (mean, 21.6 months). Forty-nine patients remained alive, and 10 died of unrelated causes. During follow-up, 48 of the 56 treated arteries remained patent and eight occluded. Thirty-four ulcers (58%) healed, 18 ulcers (31%) did not heal, and 7 patients (12%) required below-knee amputation for nonhealed ulcers and uncontrolled infection. No patient with graft occlusion was healed, and 12 ulcers persisted despite successful arterial reconstruction. Twenty-one (78%) of 27 patients undergoing greater saphenous vein stripping were healed, but none of these patients had DVT. The mean interval from bypass graft to healing was 7.9 months. Thirty-two (68%) of 46 patients without prior DVT were healed, whereas only two (15%) of 13 patients with prior DVT were healed, and this variable, in addition to graft patency, was the only factor statistically significant in predicting healing (P <.05).\nUlcers may develop anywhere on the calf or foot in patients with CAVI, and healing requires correction of arterial insufficiency. Patients with prior DVT are unlikely to heal, even with a patent bypass graft. Ulcer healing is a lengthy process and requires aggressive treatment of edema and infection, and successful arterial reconstruction. Patients with a prior DVT are unlikely to benefit from aggressive arterial or venous reconstruction.",

The mean age of patients was 67 years, 57% of the patients were male, and preexisting peripheral vascular disease was present in 74%. Presenting symptoms were limb-threatening ischemia (53%) and claudication (47%). Acute symptoms (< 2 weeks' duration) were present in 48%.\nThe 30-day morbidity rate was 31%, and four patients died. Complications were significant bleeding (23%), ischemic stroke (1%), and renal failure with (2%) and without (2%) dialysis. Concomitant angioplasty was performed in 63%. Complete or significant lysis as demonstrated with angiography was achieved in 75% of iliac, 58% of femoropopliteal, and 41% of crural vessels (P <.001). Within 30 days of lysis, 9% of patients underwent major amputation and 20% surgical revascularization (in 3 patients the extent of revascularization was lessened by the lytic therapy). Amputation-free survival was 83% and 75% at 6 months and 2 years, respectively. Relief of ischemia (defined as relief of claudication or limb salvage without major surgical intervention) was achieved in only 70% and 43% of patients at 30 days and 2 years, respectively (Kaplan-Meier analysis; mean follow-up, 31 months). Patients with aortoiliac disease had significantly better outcomes than those with infrainguinal disease (P =.03). Duration or type of presenting symptoms did not predict outcome. The cost of the initial hospitalization per patient for thrombolysis was $18,490.\nThrombolysis can be as or more costly than surgery and is associated with a suboptimal outcome in a significant number of patients.

    "abstract": "We report on a case of an isolated common iliac artery aneurysm infected by Candida albicans. To our knowledge, only one other case of this condition has been reported. The patient, a 49-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and a history of fungal urinary tract infections, had recurrent right knee pain and swelling. The knee effusion grew C albicans. Mild right hydronephrosis and a 4.6-cm aneurysm of the right common iliac artery without involvement of the aorta or iliac bifurcation was revealed by means of a computed tomography scan. The aneurysm wall was inflammatory, and there was associated purulence at the time of operation. The right ureter was densely adherent to the anterior aspect of the aneurysm, but could be palpated and dissected free because of a ureteral stent that was placed before the surgical incision. The aneurysm was resected, and the proximal and distal margins were oversewn without graft placement. C albicans was found in the resected aneurysm. The patient recovered without limb-threatening ischemia or claudication, but the distance he could walk remained limited because of right knee symptoms. The aneurysm may have formed by direct extension of infection from the right ureter or by hematogenous or lymphatic spread. This case raises interesting issues about operative strategies and etiology.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to determine whether adenoviral inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene transfer could inhibit intimal hyperplasia (IH) in porcine internal jugular veins interposed into the carotid artery circulation.\nPorcine internal jugular veins were transduced passively with 1 x 10(11) particles of an adenoviral vector carrying either the human iNOS (AdiNOS) or beta-galactosidase (AdlacZ) cDNA for 30 minutes and then interposed into the carotid artery circulation. Segments of each vein graft were maintained in an ex vivo organ culture to measure nitrite accumulation, a marker of nitric oxide synthesis. The grafts were analyzed immunohistochemically for the presence of neutrophils, macrophages, and leukocytes by staining for myeloperoxidase, ED1, and CD45, respectively, at 3 (n = 4) and 7 (n = 4) days. Morphometric analyses and cellular proliferation (Ki67 staining) were assessed at 3 (n = 4), 7 (n = 4), and 21 days (n = 8).\nAdlacZ-treated vein grafts demonstrated high levels of beta-galactosidase expression at 3 days with a gradual decline thereafter. Nitrite production from AdiNOS-treated vein grafts was approximately fivefold greater than AdlacZ-treated grafts (P =.00001). AdiNOS or AdlacZ treatment was associated with minimal graft inflammation. Cellular proliferation rates were significantly reduced in AdiNOS-treated grafts as compared with controls at both 3 (41%, P =.000004) and 7 days (32%, P =.0001) after bypass. This early antiproliferative effect was most pronounced at the distal anastomosis (65%, P =.0005). The iNOS gene transfer reduced the intimal/medial area ratio in vein grafts at 7 (36%, P =.009) and 21 days (30%, P =.007) versus controls. This inhibition of IH was again more prominent in the distal segments of the grafts (P =.01).\nAdenovirus-mediated iNOS gene transfer to porcine internal jugular vein grafts effectively reduced cellular proliferation and IH. Although iNOS gene transfer reduced IH throughout the entire vein graft, the most pronounced effect was measured at the distal anastomosis. These results suggest potential for iNOS-based genetic modification of vein grafts to prolong graft patency.",

    "abstract": "A number of changes in gene expression have been described in abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), but the spectrum of molecular alterations in this disease is unknown. The purpose of this study was to characterize the expression of approximately 1000 gene products in human AAA tissue and to compare the profile of genes expressed in AAAs with that observed in normal aorta.\nTotal RNA was isolated from abdominal aortic wall tissues (4 AAAs and 4 normal aortas), and array-specific [(32)P]-labeled complementary DNA (cDNA) probes were created with reverse transcription. The cDNA probes were hybridized with nylon membranes containing an array of 1176 cDNA clones (AtlasArray Human 1.2 I; Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif), and autoradiographs were scanned to identify the patterns of gene expression characteristic of each tissue type. Densitometric analysis was used to standardize the expression of individual genes to a panel of housekeeping controls, and differential gene expression was defined by a signal ratio of at least 2:1.\nOne hundred forty-five (12.3%) of the 1176 genes were consistently expressed in aortic tissue. Thymosin beta-4 was the most abundant of 101 transcripts detected in both AAAs and normal aorta, whereas 44 genes exhibited differential patterns of expression (39 predominant in AAAs and 5 in normal aorta). Densitometric analysis confirmed differences in expression for 20 of these gene products between AAAs and normal aorta, with the greatest increases seen for myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (31-fold), cathepsin H (30-fold), platelet-derived growth factor-A (23-fold), apolipoprotein E (13-fold), gelatinase B/matrix metalloproteinase-9 (12-fold), and interleukin-8 (11-fold). The only gene products substantially decreased in AAAs were myosin light chain kinase (39-fold) and beta-1 integrin (twofold). AAA tissues thereby exhibited a distinct pattern of gene expression reflecting chronic inflammation, extracellular matrix degradation, atherosclerosis, and smooth muscle cell depletion.\ncDNA expression arrays provide a powerful new approach to help identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for aneurysmal degeneration. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the functional and pathophysiologic significance of the individual genes that exhibit altered levels of expression in AAA tissue.",

Thymosin beta-4 was the most abundant of 101 transcripts detected in both AAAs and normal aorta, whereas 44 genes exhibited differential patterns of expression (39 predominant in AAAs and 5 in normal aorta). Densitometric analysis confirmed differences in expression for 20 of these gene products between AAAs and normal aorta, with the greatest increases seen for myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (31-fold), cathepsin H (30-fold), platelet-derived growth factor-A (23-fold), apolipoprotein E (13-fold), gelatinase B/matrix metalloproteinase-9 (12-fold), and interleukin-8 (11-fold). The only gene products substantially decreased in AAAs were myosin light chain kinase (39-fold) and beta-1 integrin (twofold). AAA tissues thereby exhibited a distinct pattern of gene expression reflecting chronic inflammation, extracellular matrix degradation, atherosclerosis, and smooth muscle cell depletion.",

    "abstract": "Dimethyl sulfoxide-cryopreserved cadaveric vein allografts have recently been proposed as an alternative to prosthetic grafts in the problem hemodialysis population. The transfer of mismatched major histocompatibility complex I and II molecules in association with these allografts can potentially lead to allosensitization in nonimmunosuppressed individuals.\nIn a university-affiliated medical center, 20 consecutive patients receiving technically successful upper arm cadaveric vein allograft fistulas (CAVFs) for hemodialysis between April 1999 and April 2000 were studied. A control cohort of 20 patients on a kidney transplantation waiting list was selected by nurses blinded to the study. These patients were matched for age, sex, history of transfusion, pregnancy, cause of kidney failure, and prior transplantation. The panel reactive antibody (PRA) values were recorded in this group over the same time period as the CAVF group.\nPatients receiving CAVFs had a mean PRA assay value of 84.1% (median, 96.5%) at an average of 3.1 months after engraftment (median, 1.5 months). The preengraftment PRA values were available for seven patients who were on the transplant waiting list. Six of these patients had nonreactive PRA assays before CAVF creation. All of these patients converted to positive PRA assays after CAVF creation with a mean value of 92.3% (median, 98%) at 2.85 months follow-up (median, 1.3 months). The mean PRA value for the control cohort was 5.5% (median, 2.5%), with no patients converting from a nonreactive to a reactive PRA assay during this same time interval.\nThe use of dimethyl sulfoxide-cryopreserved cadaveric vein allografts for hemodialysis access leads to broad allosensitization as measured by PRA assay. Cryopreserved cadaveric vein allografts should not be used for hemodialysis access in potential kidney transplant recipients.",

    "abstract": "Severe atherosclerosis is a major contributor for death in octogenarians and a cause of multiple vascular-related ailments, including claudication and limb loss. Advanced age and health may limit the success of limb-salvaging procedures. Mortality, morbidity, and outcome of infrainguinal grafts have been examined in octogenarians and septuagenarians.\nAfter 128 femoropopliteal and 99 femorotibial bypass grafts in 209 octogenarians and 242 femoropopliteal and 166 femorotibial bypass grafts in 383 septuagenarians, survival, primary patency, limb salvage, myocardial infarction and stroke rates were determined. The survival, myocardial infarction, and stroke rates of controls, 1514 octogenarians and 2011 septuagenarians, were compared.\nAfter a bypass graft, 5-year survival of octogenarians (54%) and septuagenarians (64%) was similar (P >.2) and was 89% and 89% for controls. The 5-year primary patency rates were 74% for octogenarians and 68% for septuagenarians (P >.2). Five-year limb salvage rates were 86% for octogenarians and 86% for septuagenarians. After a bypass graft, the respective rates of myocardial infarction were 4.1% and 3.9% per year and of a stroke 3.2% and 3.2% per year for octogenarians and septuagenarians, which occurred more frequently (P <.05) than in controls.\nDeath and cardiovascular events are higher after revascularization in octogenarians and septuagenarians, compared with controls, and are related to the severity of atherosclerosis and not age. Patency rates are excellent and similar. Limb salvage procedures should be considered for most octogenarians.",

An AAA of 3.0 cm or greater in diameter was found in 4.3% of men and 1.0% of women (P <.001). Contrary to a previous report, we did not find suprarenal aortic enlargement accompanying AAA to be more common in women. The principal associations that we have previously reported for AAA in this cohort (age, smoking, family history of AAA, and a negative association with diabetes) were all similar in women compared with men. In age- and smoking-adjusted models, the interaction terms indicated that black race and cancer were more strongly associated with AAA in women than men (P <.05). Height and cerebral vascular disease were also more strongly associated with AAA in women than in men, but these interaction terms did not reach statistical significance (P <.10). Although the other differences were unexpected and require confirmation, the trend toward a stronger association of cerebral vascular disease with AAA in women is consistent with two previous reports.\nDespite the much lower prevalence of AAA in women, the most important associations with AAA are similar to those seen in men. Our data provide some support for a previous finding that cerebrovascular disease may be more closely associated with AAA in women than in men.",

Seventeen patients were treated with endovascular stenting, one was treated with angioplasty alone, and six received adjunct thrombolysis.\nDespite the presence of stenosis or occlusion in all cases, APG indicated no iliac vein obstruction (outflow fraction > or = 40%) in nine patients. DUS revealed acute (6) or chronic (7) unilateral iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis in 13 of 18 patients, whereas the results of five of 18 DUS studies were normal. Recanalization and stent placement (n = 17) or angioplasty (n = 1) was achieved in all patients. The average pressure gradient was 5.6 mm Hg preprocedure and 0.6 mm Hg postprocedure. The primary patency rate demonstrated with DUS (n = 17) and venography (n = 7) at 6 months was 89%. The primary patency rate at 12 months was 79%.\nICS often presents as sudden unilateral left lower extremity pain and swelling in young to middle-aged female patients after pregnancy, surgery, or a period of inactivity. Venography, intravascular ultrasound, and magnetic resonance venography demonstrate high sensitivity, whereas APG-outflow fraction demonstrates low sensitivity in the diagnosis of ICS. Endovascular stenting and angioplasty provide safe and effective early and intermediate-term treatment of symptomatic ICS.",

    "abstract": "We sought to assess the role of endovascular techniques in the management of perigraft flow (endoleak) after endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nWe performed endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm in 114 patients, using a variety of Gianturco Z-stent-based prostheses. Results were evaluated with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) at 3 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and every year after the operation. An endoleak that occurred 3 days after operation led to repeat CT scanning at 2 weeks, followed by angiography and attempted endovascular treatment.\nEndoleak was seen on the first postoperative CT scan in 21 (18%) patients and was still present at 2 weeks in 14 (12%). On the basis of angiographic localization of the inflow, the endoleak was pure type I in 3 cases, pure type II in 9, and mixed-pattern in 2. Of the 5 type I endoleaks, 3 were proximal and 2 were distal. All five resolved after endovascular implantation of additional stent-grafts, stents, and embolization coils. Although inferior mesenteric artery embolization was successful in 6 of 7 cases and lumbar embolization was successful in 4 of 7, only 1 of 11 primary type II endoleaks was shown to be resolved on CT scanning. There were no type III or type IV endoleaks (through the stent-graft). Endoleak was associated with aneurysm dilation two cases. In both cases, the aneurysm diameter stabilized after coil embolization of the inferior mesenteric artery. There were two secondary (delayed) endoleaks; one type I and one type II. The secondary type I endoleak and the associated aneurysm rupture were treated by use of an additional stent-graft. The secondary type II endoleak was not treated.\nType I endoleaks represent a persistent risk of aneurysm rupture and should be treated promptly by endovascular means. Type II leaks are less dangerous and more difficult to treat, but coil embolization of feeding arteries may be warranted when leakage is associated with aneurysm enlargement.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies demonstrating a correlation between low shear stress (tau = 5-15 dyne/cm(2)) and experimental vein graft neointimal thickening (NIT) support the role of low tau in vein graft failure. However, a simple linear relationship between low tau and NIT would underestimate the degree of NIT evident in high-grade occlusive lesions of failing human vein grafts. In this study we used a new experimental model that maintains patency at low tau (< 2 dyne/cm(2)), to delineate possible deviations from linearity in the low tau --> NIT hypothesis.\nThirty-two New Zealand White rabbits underwent creation of a common carotid vein patch with a segment of ipsilateral external jugular vein. Very low tau was created in 13 patches by ligation of the distal common carotid artery, leaving the only outflow through a small muscular branch. Normal tau was created in 11 patches by leaving the common carotid artery outflow intact. High tau was created in eight patches by ligation of the contralateral common carotid artery. Six patches were harvested after 2 weeks for measurement of cell cycle entry by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry. The remaining 26 patches were harvested after 4 weeks, perfusion fixed, and excised for morphometric analysis.\nMean blood flow and tau at implantation ranged from 0.5 to 41 mL/min and 0.07 to 15 dyne/cm(2), respectively. At the time of harvest, 30 of 32 patches remained patent, and the artificially created aberrations in blood flow were maintained (range, 0.7-41 mL/min). After 2 weeks PCNA immunohistochemistry showed a significantly higher level of cell cycling in patches exposed to low tau (40 +/- 5 vs 1.6 +/- 0.3 PCNA-positive cells per high-power field; P <.001), which is equivalent to approximately 20% of the total cells present. In patches harvested after 4 weeks, NIT ranged from 42 to 328 microm and significantly correlated with mean tau at implantation. Patches with very low tau exhibited histologic characteristics similar to those of failing human bypass grafts, including laminar thrombus and flow-limiting luminal stenosis. The relationship between tau and NIT was nonlinear in that extremely low tau (< 2 dyne/cm(2)) resulted in NIT beyond that predicted by a simple linear correlation (P =.003).\nExtremely low tau (< 2 dyne/cm(2)) stimulates high rates of smooth muscle cellular proliferation in arterialized vein patches. NIT is accelerated in these regions of low tau far beyond that predicted by a simple linear model. The nonlinear nature of the cellular proliferative response and NIT at tau less than 2 dyne/cm(2) may explain the rapid progression of neointimal lesions in failing bypass grafts.",

    "abstract": "Clinically, abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) display a spectrum of inflammation that extends from apparently noninflamed (degenerative) AAAs to the classic inflammatory variant. Genes encoded in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region are important in the development of both variants of AAA; however, their role in progression to the inflammatory variant is unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare HLA class II genes in patients with degenerative versus classic inflammatory AAAs and to quantify their impact as disease risk factors.\nGenotypes of the 12 major alleles of the HLA-DR B1 locus were determined in patients with degenerative (102) and inflammatory (40) AAAs who were compared with controls (118). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine allele distributions and to quantify disease risk.\nDistribution of the HLA-DR B1 alleles was nonrandom and similar in both degenerative and inflammatory AAA groups compared with controls. The B1*02 and B1*04 alleles were enhanced in both degenerative (39.2% vs. 25.4%, P =.03; and 35.3% vs. 24.6%, P =.08 respectively) and inflammatory (47.5% vs. 25.4%, P =.01; and 32.5% vs. 24.6%, P =.09, respectively) AAAs compared with controls. The B1*02 and B1*04 alleles were associated with risk for both degenerative (odds ratio [OR] 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.0; and OR 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7, respectively) and inflammatory AAAs (OR 3.7; 95% CI, 1.8-8.6; and OR 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-6.1).\nThis study demonstrates that identical HLA alleles function as genetic risk factors for both inflammatory and degenerative AAAs. These results support the concept of a common, immune-mediated pathogenesis for AAAs that may be modulated by HLA-independent factors.",

    "abstract": "The hypothesis to be tested was that diminished bioavailable nitric oxide (NO) affects matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and activation in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs).\nCultivated rat aortic SMCs (RA-SMCs) were exposed to increasing concentrations of L-N-monomethyl arginine (L-NMMA), a nonselective inhibitor of NO synthase, in the presence of proinflammatory cytokines (50 ng/mL interleukin [IL]-1beta, 50 ng/mL interferon-gamma, and 30 microg/mL lipopolysaccharide). Nitrite and nitrate, two of the final end products of NO metabolism, were measured in media collected at 48 hours with the use of the Saville assay (n = 4). MMP activity was measured with 1% gelatin zymography (n = 4). In separate experiments in which 2 ng/mL of IL-1beta and L-NMMA was used, MMP protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were determined with Western blot analysis (n = 3) and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (n = 3), respectively. Data were analyzed with nonparametric analysis of variance.\nIncreasing concentrations of the NO synthase inhibitor L-NMMA caused a dose-dependent decrease (P <.05) in nitrite and nitrate production by RA-SMCs after cytokine exposure. Zymography documented an early dosedependent increase (P <.05 compared with cytokines alone) in 92-kd MMP activity, with no significant changes in 72-kd MMP activity after treatment with L-NMMA (P >.05 compared with cytokines alone). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis revealed that the addition of L-NMMA to IL-1beta-stimulated RA-SMCs led to significant increases in MMP-9 mRNA (n = 3, P <.01 for 1.0 mmol/L L-NMMA) and MMP-9 protein levels (n = 3, P <.05), respectively. No differences in MMP-2 mRNA or protein levels were demonstrated.\nInhibition of cytokine-induced NO expression in RA-SMCs is associated with a selective, dose-dependent increase in MMP-9 expression and synthesis. These findings suggest that alterations in local NO synthesis may influence MMP-9-dependent vessel wall damage.",

Zymography documented an early dosedependent increase (P <.05 compared with cytokines alone) in 92-kd MMP activity, with no significant changes in 72-kd MMP activity after treatment with L-NMMA (P >.05 compared with cytokines alone). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis revealed that the addition of L-NMMA to IL-1beta-stimulated RA-SMCs led to significant increases in MMP-9 mRNA (n = 3, P <.01 for 1.0 mmol/L L-NMMA) and MMP-9 protein levels (n = 3, P <.05), respectively. No differences in MMP-2 mRNA or protein levels were demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "The ability to treat abdominal aortoiliac aneurysms and thoracic aortic aneurysms may be limited by coexisting arterial disease. Device deployment may be impaired by occlusive disease and tortuosity of the arteries used to access the aneurysm or by suitability of the implantation sites. In this study we describe the auxiliary procedures performed to circumvent these obstacles and thereby enable endovascular aneurysm repair.\nBetween January 1, 1993, and December 31, 1999, 390 patients treated for aneurysm of the aorta with endovascular devices were entered prospectively in a vascular registry. Fifty (12%) of the 390 patients required adjunctive surgical techniques to (1) create or extend the length of the proximal or distal device implantation site or (2) permit device navigation through diseased iliac arteries. Auxiliary techniques used to extend or enhance implantation sites were elephant trunk graft (n = 2), the construction of renovisceral bypass grafts (n = 1), and subclavian artery transposition (n = 2). Plication of the common iliac artery at its bifurcation was performed in conjunction with femorofemoral bypass graft in nine patients to allow preservation of pelvic circulation by avoiding internal iliac artery sacrifice. Construction of a bypass graft to transpose the internal iliac artery orifice was performed in one patient. The auxiliary techniques used to facilitate device navigation were iliac artery angioplasty or stenting (n = 8), external iliac artery endovascular endarterectomy or straightening (n = 14), endoluminal iliofemoral bypass conduit (n = 5), and the construction of an open iliofemoral bypass conduit (n = 8).\nSuccessful deployment of the endovascular devices was achieved in 49 (98%) of 50 patients. Auxiliary techniques were successful in providing access for endovascular device deployment in all 35 patients (100%). Mean follow-up for techniques to facilitate device navigation is 26 months for endovascular procedures and 42 months for the open bypass graft construction patients; no occlusions were observed at this moment. There were five patients with incisional hematomas that did not necessitate intervention. Fourteen (94%) of 15 patients underwent successful device implantation after the auxiliary maneuvers to enhance implantation site. Mean follow-up for implantation site manipulation is 28 months. One of the subclavian transpositions had a new onset of Horner's syndrome, two of nine patients who had common iliac artery ligated had retroperitoneal hematomas that did not necessitate interventions, and no colon ischemia was seen. The patient who underwent nonanatomic bypass grafting of viscero-renal arteries had a retroperitoneal hematoma that necessitated reexploration.\nSignificant coexisting arterial disease may be encountered in patients with aortic or iliac aneurysms. Identification of coexisting arterial diseases is essential to help tailor the appropriate supplemental surgical procedure to allow the performance of endovascular aneurysm repair in patients who would otherwise require open surgical repair.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine what factors are predictive of a decline in independent living after vascular surgery during recovery.\nDemographics, risk factors, operations, complications, wound status, and discharge disposition for all patients admitted to a tertiary vascular surgery service for any surgical procedure were prospectively recorded at the time of discharge. The declining order of dispositions at discharge were home (no professional assistance), home (professional assistance), rehabilitation facility, and skilled nursing facility.\nOver a 15-month period, 380 patients underwent 442 primary operations. Primary operations included 74 (17%) carotid procedures, 38 (8%) aortic procedures, 186 (42%) extremity revascularizations, 29 (7%) major amputations, 45 (10%) minor amputations, and 70 (16%) other. There were 148 (33%) complications and 85 (20%) subsequent operations (same hospitalization); 159 (36%) open wounds occurred. Forty-six percent of the patients were discharged to home (no professional assistance), 28% to home (professional assistance), 3% to a rehabilitation facility, and 18% to a skilled nursing facility; 5% died. At discharge, 51% of patients required professional assistance, 39% had a decline in disposition, and 12% went from home (+/- professional assistance) to a facility. By multivariate regression analysis, a hospital stay more than 6 days, emergency operation, open operative wound, systemic complications, and minor amputation were significantly associated (P <.001) with a decline in disposition at discharge (odds ratios: 5.5, 3.7, 3.6, 3.6, and 2.8, respectively).\nProspective study reveals that a large proportion of patients (39%) had a decline in disposition after vascular surgery. A hospital stay more than 6 days, emergency operation, open operative wound, systemic complications, and minor amputation were strong independent predictors of decline. This information suggests modifications in treatment strategies may improve independent living status after vascular surgery and decrease the intense use of extended care resources required for this patient population during recovery.",

Patients were identified by the presence of a diagnostic or procedure code from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). The main outcomes we examined were death, ICD-9-CM -based complications, length of stay, hospital charges, and disposition. A multivariate model was constructed to predict death.\nA total of 2934 patients were identified (TAA, 540; RAB, 2058; CMI, 336) in the database. The mean age was comparable (TAA, 69 +/- 9 years; RAB, 66 +/- 12 years; CMI, 66 +/- 11 years), but the breakdown between the sexes varied by procedure (male: TAA, 53%; RAB, 55%; CMI, 24%). The mortality rate (TAA, 20.3%; RAB, 7.1%; CMI, 14.7%), complication rate (TAA, 62.2%; RAB, 37.4%; CMI, 44.6%), and the percentage of patients discharged to another institution (TAA, 21.2%; RAB, 9.3%; CMI, 12.0%) were clinically significant for all procedures. The mortality rate for RAB was greater when performed concomitant with an aortic reconstruction (4.4% vs 8.3%). All three procedures were resource intensive as reflected by the median length of stay (TAA, 14 days; RAB, 9 days; CMI, 14 days) and median hospital charges (TAA, $64,493; RAB, $36,830; CMI, $47,390). The multivariate model identified several variables for each procedure that had an impact on the predicted mortality rate (TAA, 14%-76%; RAB, < 1%-46%; CMI, < 2%-87%).\nThe operative mortality rates across the United States for patients undergoing TAA repair and RAB are greater than commonly reported in the literature and mandate reexamining the treatment strategies for these complex vascular problems.",

    "abstract": "Rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) remains lethal. In a report of patients treated in the 1980s, we recommended aggressive management. Our continued experience prompted us to reevaluate this policy.\nWe reviewed clinical variables affecting outcome, morbidity, mortality, and trends in mortality of all patients managed at our institution with ruptured AAAs between January 2, 1980, and November 30, 1998.\nThe study group included 413 consecutive patients, 339 men and 74 women. The mean age was 74.3 years (range, 49-96); 116 (28%) patients were older than 80 years. AAA was diagnosed before rupture in 119 (29%) patients. Eighty (19%) patients had preoperative cardiac arrest. Twenty-nine (7%) patients died before operation; 65 (17%) died during the operation. The surgical mortality rate (30-day) was 37%; the overall mortality rate was 45% and was higher in women (68%) than in men (40%) (P <.001). Advanced age, APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score, initial hematocrit, and preoperative cardiac arrest were associated multivariately with 30-day mortality rates by means of stepwise logistic regression (P <.05). Twelve (23%) of 53 patients with cardiac arrest survived the operation. Logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, and APACHE II score, demonstrated a decrease in overall and 30-day mortality rates (P <.001) over 18 years. The mean overall mortality rate was 51% from 1980 to 1984 and 42% from 1994 to 1998.\nThe mortality rate of ruptured AAAs remains excessive, despite improvement over 18 years. Patients older than 80 years with shock or cardiac arrest have the highest mortality rate and should be evaluated for possible endovascular treatment. Because the diagnosis of AAA was unknown in more than 70% of patients, screening of the high-risk population and elective repair are recommended.",

The surgical mortality rate (30-day) was 37%; the overall mortality rate was 45% and was higher in women (68%) than in men (40%) (P <.001). Advanced age, APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score, initial hematocrit, and preoperative cardiac arrest were associated multivariately with 30-day mortality rates by means of stepwise logistic regression (P <.05). Twelve (23%) of 53 patients with cardiac arrest survived the operation. Logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, and APACHE II score, demonstrated a decrease in overall and 30-day mortality rates (P <.001) over 18 years.

    "abstract": "Limb length discrepancies (LLDs) in growing children may accompany extremity arterial occlusions. Revascularization with vein grafts has been questioned because of degenerative graft changes observed at other sites. This study was undertaken to define vein graft durability and efficacy in lower extremity revascularizations in preadolescent children.\nFourteen children (10 boys, 4 girls) with a mean age of 7.3 years (range, 2-11 years) who underwent 16 lower extremity revascularizations with greater saphenous vein grafts were subjected to follow-up with graft ultrasonography, ankle/brachial indices (ABIs) with and without exercise, and limb length determinations. A mean of 5.7 years elapsed between the onset of ischemia and operation. Arterial occlusions resulted from cardiac catheterizations (11), arteritis (1), dialysis cannulation (1), and penetrating trauma (1). Indications for operation included LLD (6), claudication (4), both LLD and claudication (3), markedly diminished ABIs with a potential for LLD (2), and a traumatic transection with hemorrhage (1). The reconstructions with 15 reversed and one in situ vein grafts included iliofemoral (11), femorofemoral (1), aortofemoral (1), femoropopliteal (1), popliteal-popliteal (1), and popliteal-posterior tibial (1) arterial bypass grafts.\nAmong patent grafts available for follow-up, 36% (5 of 14) remained unchanged, 50% (7 of 14) developed nonaneurysmal dilatation, and 14% (2 of 14) exhibited nonprogressive aneurysmal expansion. One graft became occluded, and one graft was lost to follow-up. Collectively, the grafts manifest an 11.2% expansion at an average of 10.7 years postoperatively. ABIs increased from 0.75 preoperatively to 0.97, at an average of 11.0 years postoperatively. LLDs were reduced from 1.66 to 1.24 cm, at an average of 11.4 years postoperatively.\nVein graft reconstructions of lower extremity arteries in preadolescent children are durable. They provide an efficacious means of restoring normal blood flow, and in 70% of children their preexisting LLDs were reduced.",

    "abstract": "Infrainguinal bypass grafting for limb-threatening ischemia in patients with end-stage renal disease is generally thought to be associated with increased operative risk and poor long-term outcome. This retrospective study was undertaken to examine the modern-era, long-term results of infrainguinal bypass grafting in dialysis-dependent patients.\nOver the past 5 years in a single institution, 425 lower extremities (368 consecutive patients) were revascularized for the indication of limb salvage. Sixty-four patients (82 limbs) were dialysis-dependent at the time of revascularization, and this group was analyzed separately. They exhibited statistically significant higher incidences of diabetes (83% vs 56%; P <.001), hypertension (91% vs 74%; P <.001), and more distal vascular disease, which required a greater proportion of proximal anastomoses at the popliteal level (24% vs 11%; P <.01) and distal anastomoses at the infrapopliteal level (75% vs 65%; P <.05).\nDespite the higher prevalence of comorbid conditions and distal disease in patients with renal failure, their perioperative 30-day mortality rate remained low (4.9%) and was not significantly different from that in patients with functioning kidneys (2.9%; P = not significant). After a median follow-up of 11 months (range, 0-60 months), the 3-year autogenous conduit secondary graft patency in patients with renal failure was no different than in patients with functioning kidneys (67% +/- 9% vs 64% +/- 5%; P = not significant). Nonautogenous conduits in dialysis-dependent patients exhibited a significantly poorer outcome with only 27% +/- 12% remaining secondarily patent at 2 years. As expected, both limb salvage and patient survival were significantly less in patients with renal faiture, although both exceeded 50% at 3 years (limb salvage 59% +/- 8% vs 68% +/- 5%; P <.05; patient survival 60% +/- 8% vs 86% +/- 4%; P <.001). The often-quoted phenomenon of limb loss, despite a patent bypass graft, occurred infrequently in this study (n = 3 of 82 limbs).\nInfrainguinal revascularization can be performed in dialysis-dependent patients with acceptable perioperative and long-term results, especially in patients in whom adequate autologous conduit is available.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to report a feasibility trial approved by the Institutional Review Board for insertion of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance in the intensive care unit.\nBetween October 1998 and May 2000, 26 patients (15 men, 11 women; age range, 22-86 years; mean, 55 years) were enrolled. Eight patients (31%) underwent prophylactic filter placement, and 18 patients (69%) had venous thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis = 16, pulmonary embolism = 2) with contraindications to anticoagulation. A single groin puncture was used for IVUS and filter placement. Location of major branch veins, thrombosis, and caval diameter were readily demonstrated without the use of radiocontrast agents. Mapping of the IVC permitted assessment of ideal filter location. Postprocedure radiographs (23 of 26) were obtained to document filter position. Seventeen of 26 had follow-up lower extremity duplex studies.\nTwenty-four (92%) of 26 patients underwent successful filter deployment. The two other patients had filters subsequently placed by means of traditional fluoroscopic techniques. One femoral vein insertion site thrombosis resolved after a month. One patient experienced symptomatic caval thrombosis thought to be caused by thrombus trapping 55 days after the procedure. No pulmonary emboli occurred after filter placement. One patient's death was unrelated to vena cava filter placement. The hospital charge for bedside filters was $3623 compared with $4165 (P =.281) for fluoroscopic placement.\nBedside insertion of an IVC filter with IVUS guidance is feasible and may be an effective alternative in the intensive care unit. No additional costs were incurred in this small series. Protocol refinements should reduce the incidence of complications.

Sixty-two patients had a postoperative wound hematoma or neurologic deficit (ND) (transient ischemic attack or stroke) within 24 hours of their operation, complications potentially requiring a second operation. Excluded were 64 patients not eligible for same-day discharge because of other reasons (eg, heparinization, CEA with coronary artery bypass grafting).\nSixty-two patients (8.0%) had ND (26 [3.4%]) or neck hematoma (NH) (36 [4.7%]) within 24 hours of their CEA. Nineteen (73%) of the NDs were diagnosed in the operating room or recovery room, 5 (19%) within 8 hours of the operation, and 2 (7.7%) after 8 hours but in less than 24 hours. Of the NHs, 23 (66%) were diagnosed in the recovery room, 11 (31%) within 8 hours, and 1 (2.7%) after 8 hours. Of the outliers, one patient experienced a blowout of the vein graft occurring on postoperative day 1, one patient had a delayed ipsilateral stroke, and one had a vertebrobasilar stroke. Overall, only three of 773 (0.4%) patients undergoing CEA had a complication occurring more than 8 hours after operation.\nNDs and NHs in post-CEA patients occurred within 8 hours of operation in 95% of those patients experiencing these complications or 99.6% of all CEA patients. These data indicate that same-evening discharge may be safely performed without increasing the adverse effects of stroke or hematoma. This plan has cautiously been initiated at this institution.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine the safety and efficacy of reoperations for recurrent carotid stenosis (REDOCEA) at the Cleveland Clinic.\nFrom 1989 to 1999, 206 consecutive REDOCEAs were performed in 199 patients (131 men, 68 women) with a mean age of 68 years (median, 69 years; range, 47-86 years). A total of 119 procedures (57%) were performed for severe asymptomatic stenosis, 55 (27%) for hemispheric transient ischemic attacks or amaurosis fugax, 26 (13%) for prior stroke, and 6 (3%) for vertebrobasilar symptoms. Eleven REDOCEAs (5%) were combined with myocardial revascularization, and another 19 (9%) represented multiple carotid reoperations (17 second reoperations and 2 third reoperations). Three REDOCEAs (1%) were closed primarily, and nine (4%) required interposition grafts, whereas the remaining 194 (95%) were repaired with either vein patch angioplasty (139 [68%]) or synthetic patches (55 [27%]). Three patients (2%) were lost to follow-up, but late information was available for 196 patients (203 operations) at a mean interval of 4.3 years (median, 3.9 years; maximum, 10.2 years).\nConsidering all 206 procedures, there were 7 early (< 30 days) postoperative neurologic events (3.4%), including 6 perioperative strokes (2.9%) and 1 occipital hemorrhage (0.5%) on the 12th postoperative day. Seventeen additional neurologic events occurred during the late follow-up period, consisting of eight strokes (3.9%) and nine transient ischemic attacks (4.4 %). With the Kaplan-Meier method, the estimated 5-year freedom from stroke was 92% (95% CI, 88%-96%). There were two early postoperative deaths (1%), both from cardiac complications after REDOCEAs combined with myocardial revascularization procedures. With the Kaplan-Meier method, the estimated 5-year survival was 81% (range, 75%-88%). A univariate Cox regression model yielded the presence of coronary artery disease as the only variable that was significantly associated with survival (P =.024). The presence of pulmonary disease (P =.036), diabetes (P =.01), and advancing age (P =.006) was found to be significantly associated with stroke after REDOCEA. Causes of 53 late deaths were cardiovascular problems in 25 patients (47%), unknown in 14 (26%), renal failure in 4 (8%), stroke in 3 (6%), and miscellaneous in 7 (13%).\nWe conclude that REDOCEA may be safely performed in selected patients with recurrent carotid stenosis and that most of these patients enjoy long-term freedom from stroke.",

    "abstract": "Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome is a disabling and potentially life-threatening complication. SVC revascularization can be achieved by means of endovascular or direct surgical reconstructions. In the patient on whom we report, these two options were not possible, and a peripheral venous bypass grafting procedure was done with a technical innovation. Right upper-extremity swelling developed in a 55-year-old woman after radiation therapy for lung carcinoma. A left subclavian vein Port-A-Cath induced extensive thrombosis of the left innominate, axillosubclavian, and jugular veins. She was referred to our institution with very symptomatic SVC syndrome after two failed endovascular interventions. The occlusion of both innominate veins and chronic thrombus extending into the left axillosubclavian and internal jugular veins was confirmed by means of a venogram. A third endovascular attempt failed. The presternal skin had severe radiation-induced damage precluding direct SVC reconstruction. A bypass grafting procedure from the right internal jugular to the femoral vein was performed with spliced bilateral greater saphenous veins tunneled inside an externally supported expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft. Postoperatively, the patient had no symptoms, and graft patency was confirmed by means of duplex ultrasound scanning. A saphenojugular bypass grafting procedure can offer prompt and durable relief of SVC syndrome when endovascular or direct surgical reconstructions are not possible. This rarely used peripheral venous bypass grafting procedure was modified by tunneling the vein graft inside an externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene graft to prevent kinking or compression.",

The Vanguard device is anchored into the proximal aorta by an expandable stent surmounted by a circular array of metal hooks. Attempted removal of the whole prosthesis may therefore be technically difficult and result in damage of the aortic wall. Surgery for endoleak may be complicated and carry a mortality rate of 20% to 40%. We describe a simple surgical technique for repair of endoleaks associated with a Vanguard stent-graft, which would be applicable to other such devices. This method involves minimal disruption of the proximal stent and avoids problems that may arise from an attempt to completely remove the endovascular device.",

In the in vivo study, smaller endovascular grafts were placed in the aortas of four healthy pigs and five pigs with aortic aneurysms. Our data suggest that this very low profile system may have significant clinical implications because it converts aortic repair into a percutaneous procedure.",

    "abstract": "The migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are important events in the development of intimal hyperplasia (IH). The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) gene encodes a protein tyrosine kinase (p125FAK) involved in signal transduction pathways used in cell adhesion, motility, and proliferation. Because alterations in these cellular processes are thought to occur in VSMCs during IH, we studied FAK expression in healthy arteries and veins in comparison with that in pathologic vessels containing IH.\nTo determine p125FAK expression at the cellular level, we developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically detected FAK in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections (5 microm) and analyzed the levels of FAK expression in human arteries and veins. Specificity of monoclonal antibody 4.47 was demonstrated by means of immunofluorescence microscopy showing FAK-specific staining at focal adhesions of healthy human vascular smooth muscle cells (AoSMCs). By using immunohistochemistry techniques, we analyzed the expression of p125FAK in 25 adult human vascular tissue samples from individual patients, which contained a histologically confirmed healthy artery, vein, or IH.\nFAK expression in healthy and pathologic human vascular tissue was localized predominantly within VSMC cytoplasm. In healthy human artery and vein, borderline FAK expression was detected in the media of seven of 17 vessels and undetectable in the remainder of specimens. However, in vessels containing IH, FAK was overexpressed in the pathologic VSMC populations at moderate-to-strong levels in eight of eight specimens. The levels of FAK expression were directly correlated with structures containing IH, and the results of FAK staining intensity and the percentage of positive cells in these samples were significantly increased compared with normal vascular tissue levels (P <.05, Student t test).\nThese results provide the first evidence that FAK is overexpressed in VSMCs involved in IH and suggest that FAK upregulation may be part of a mechanism for migration and proliferation of VSMCs during this process. Furthermore, the dramatic upregulation of FAK in IH and the relative lack of expression in healthy vessels suggest that FAK may be a rational target for controlling IH.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to enhance the retention of seeded endothelial cells (EC) on prosthetic vascular grafts. Dual-layer EC and smooth muscle cell (SMC) seeding and gene transfer of a zymogen tissue plasminogen activator gene (tPA) into seeded EC were studied.\nPolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts were precoated with fibronectin, seeded with SMC followed by EC a day later, and then, 24 hours later, exposed to an in vitro flow system for 1 hour. Cell retention rates were determined for grafts seeded with EC only, a dual layer of EC on top of SMC, EC transduced with wild-type tPA, and EC transduced with zymogen tPA.\nSeeding efficiency of PTFE pretreated with fibronectin was 260 +/- 8 cell/mm(2). After exposure to flow, only 39% +/- 14% of the EC were retained when EC were seeded alone, whereas 73% +/- 22% of EC remained on grafts when EC were seeded on top of SMC (P <.001, n = 10). The enzyme activity of a mutant zymogen tPA in absence of fibrin was 14 +/- 1 IU/mL, which is 3.6-fold lower than that in the presence of fibrin (50 +/- 19 IU/mL), whereas fibrin has no effect on the wild-type tPA activity. EC expressing a high level of wild-type tPA had a lower retention rate (37%) when compared with normal EC (45%). EC expressing the mutant zymogen tPA had an improved retention rate (54%, P =.001, n = 10) in absence of fibrin, whereas its retention rate was reduced to 43% when the cells were exposed to fibrin.\nSMC seeded between EC and PTFE improves EC retention in vitro. Transduction of zymogen tPA increases thrombolytic ability of seeded cells with less adverse impact on cell retention than wild-type tPA.",

The FPC, which we are using as a monitor of spinal cord ischemia, is myogenic potentials evoked by the tibial nerve stimulation through the anterior horn cells.\nIn 18 rabbits, infrarenal lumbar arteries were clamped until there was an FPC amplitude reduction (FPCAR) of at least 60%. The rabbits were classified according to the number of arteries clamped to produce the FPCAR (group A, 1 artery; group B, 2 arteries; group C, 3 arteries). Selective angiography of each lumbar artery was performed in all rabbits.\nAn FPCAR was observed in all 18 rabbits. In all nine rabbits in group A, the FPCAR was caused by the clamping of one particular lumbar artery. The GRA was shown by means of selective angiography to originate directly from this lumbar artery. In the nine rabbits in groups B and C, 11 FPCARs were observed.

    "abstract": "The goals of this study were to delineate the time course of endothelial dysfunction after arterial thrombosis, to determine the cause of endothelial dysfunction in this setting, and to determine whether modulating standard thrombolytic therapy would ameliorate the thrombosis-mediated endothelial dysfunction.\nMale adult rats underwent infrarenal aortic occlusion by means of clip ligature to induce arterial thrombosis. After 30 minutes, 1, 2, and 3 hours, ring segments from the infrarenal aorta were harvested and placed into physiologic buffer baths. With the use of a force transducer, both endothelial-dependent relaxation (EDR) and endothelial-independent relaxation (EIR) were measured. Endothelial function and presence were determined by means of factor VIII immunohistochemical staining. Endothelial morphology was evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Nitric oxide (NO) levels were determined with a chemiluminescent assay of its nitrite/nitrate metabolites (NO(x)). Standard thrombolytic therapy with urokinase (UK) was infused into thrombosed aortic ring segments and compared with UK supplemented with both low-dose L -arginine (2 mmol) and high-dose L -arginine (20 mmol).\nArterial thrombosis decreases EDR. The nadir of EDR occurs 1 hour after thrombosis (mean +/- SE, 13% +/- 6.4% vs 94% +/- 2.6% for controls, P <.005), with persistent lowering of EDR as long as 3 hours after thrombosis. EIR is preserved, and vasoconstriction with norepinephrine or potassium buffer is unaltered. Both endothelial function and presence (n = 6 per group) were documented by means of factor VIII immunohistochemistry. An intact monolayer of endothelium at all time intervals after thrombosis was revealed by means of SEM analysis. No differences between control and thrombosed specimens were revealed by means of the grading of SEM images. Local NO(x) levels were lower after 1 hour of thrombosis, with an increase higher than baseline values at 3 hours. The addition of low-dose L -arginine resulted in a minor increase in EDR. However, high-dose L -arginine resulted in a significant increase in EDR versus controls receiving UK alone (64% +/- 6.3% vs 38% +/- 4.4%, P <.05). Correspondingly, local NO(x) levels were 20-fold higher after the high-dose L -arginine supplementation when compared with UK thrombolysis alone (2.8 +/- 0.52 micromol/L vs 0.133 +/- 0.02 micromol/L, n = 6 samples/group, P <.005).\nAcute arterial thrombosis causes endothelial dysfunction, without causing endothelial cell loss. Endothelial function reaches a nadir after 1 hour of thrombosis. EIR and vasoconstriction remain unaffected, indicating normal smooth muscle cell function. NO(x) levels suggest that NO levels are decreased acutely after thrombosis. Supplementing standard thrombolytic therapy with the NO precursor, l-arginine, ameliorates the endothelial dysfunction seen after acute thrombosis by increasing local NO production.",

The nadir of EDR occurs 1 hour after thrombosis (mean +/- SE, 13% +/- 6.4% vs 94% +/- 2.6% for controls, P <.005), with persistent lowering of EDR as long as 3 hours after thrombosis. EIR is preserved, and vasoconstriction with norepinephrine or potassium buffer is unaltered. Both endothelial function and presence (n = 6 per group) were documented by means of factor VIII immunohistochemistry. An intact monolayer of endothelium at all time intervals after thrombosis was revealed by means of SEM analysis. No differences between control and thrombosed specimens were revealed by means of the grading of SEM images. Local NO(x) levels were lower after 1 hour of thrombosis, with an increase higher than baseline values at 3 hours. The addition of low-dose L -arginine resulted in a minor increase in EDR. However, high-dose L -arginine resulted in a significant increase in EDR versus controls receiving UK alone (64% +/- 6.3% vs 38% +/- 4.4%, P <.05). Correspondingly, local NO(x) levels were 20-fold higher after the high-dose L -arginine supplementation when compared with UK thrombolysis alone (2.8 +/- 0.52 micromol/L vs 0.133 +/- 0.02 micromol/L, n = 6 samples/group, P <.005).",

MMP-2 is secreted as a latent 72-kd proenzyme that must be proteolytically processed to the 62-kd active form. In our laboratory we demonstrated a significant increase of active, matrix-bound MMP-2 in abdominal aortic aneurysmal (AAA) tissue compared with nonaneurysmal aorta with arteriosclerotic occlusive disease and normal aortic tissue. This increase in active MMP-2 is considered to be important in aneurysm pathogenesis, but the mechanism of its activation in aortic tissue is unknown. Membrane type-1 MMP (MT-1 MMP) is known to be an activator of MMP-2. The purpose of this study was to determine MT-1 MMP expression and its involvement in pro-MMP-2 activation in human aneurysmal tissue.\nInfrarenal aortic tissue was obtained during the surgical repair of AAAs or the bypass of aortoiliac occlusive disease, or from nondiseased aorta, and the expression of MT-1 MMP messenger RNA was determined with Northern blot analysis. MT-1 MMP protein was determined with immunoblot and immunohistochemistry. The ability of aortic tissue to activate pro-MMP-2 was analyzed by incubating aortic tissue with exogenous radiolabeled pro-MMP-2.\nMT-1 MMP messenger RNA and protein are increased in AAA (P <.05) compared with arteriosclerotic occlusive disease and normal aortic tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis localized MT-1 MMP to aortic smooth muscle cells and macrophages in aneurysmal tissue. AAA tissue demonstrated a greater capacity to activate exogenous pro-MMP-2 compared with atherosclerotic and normal aortic tissue (P <.05).\nThese studies demonstrate that MT-1 MMP is increased in AAA tissue and suggest that it may be important in AAA pathogenesis through its ability to activate pro-MMP-2",

    "abstract": "The treatment of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is typically based on the potential for rupture. Current rupture assessments are in turn based on statistics from aggregate populations and are incapable of providing precise risk estimates for individual AAAs. Significant benefit could be realized if rupture potential for individual AAAs could be reliably determined on the basis of simple geometric characteristics or the results of symmetric thin-shell analysis. This study seeks to determine whether it is possible to estimate wall stresses by use of these simple measures.\nLinear finite element analysis was used to estimate the distribution of von Mises stresses in a series of homogeneous, isotropic, three-dimensional AAA models subject to static loading and assumed to have zero residual stresses. The magnitude of the peak stress was tabulated for each model along with the following characteristics: aneurysm volume; maximum diameter; maximum radius; maximal wall distention; aspect ratio (ratio of greatest anteroposterior diameter to transverse diameter); local radii of curvature (in both longitudinal and circumferential directions); and maximum symmetric thin-shell stress estimates (on the basis of the meridional contour). The relationship between peak stress and each of the characteristics was assessed by use of Spearman rank correlation coefficients, with values less than 0.95 interpreted as signifying unreliable associations.\nPeak stresses in the individual models ranged from 1.79 x 10(6) dyne/cm2 to 15.1 x 10(6) dyne/cm2. The circumferential and longitudinal radii of curvature were frequently able to predict the locations of high stress, but were unreliable in predicting the magnitude of peak stress. The aspect ratio showed the strongest correlation with peak wall stress (r = 0.88, 95% CI, 0.68-0.96), whereas the other characteristics showed even less correlation. Symmetric thin shell analysis accurately predicted stresses in axially symmetric models, but it was incapable of predicting either the location or magnitude of peak stress in asymmetric models.\nSimple geometric criteria and symmetric thin shell analyses are unreliable in predicting AAA stresses. Future attempts to estimate wall stress and assess risk of rupture for individual AAAs may require detailed three-dimensional modeling.",

    "abstract": "Hemodynamics has been implicated in the late failure of arterial bypass grafts, which frequently occurs at the distal anastomosis site. This study was designed to assess the relationship between local hemodynamics and pathologic responses of the distal anastomosis by manipulation of the angle of anastomosis of the graft, a major determinant of local hemodynamics.\nEnd-to-side anastomoses of the right carotid to the left carotid arteries of rabbits were performed at anastomotic angles of less than 10 degrees (acute), 45 degrees (intermediate), or 90 degrees (right angle), and then the upstream left carotid arteries were ligated to simulate pathologic occlusion. We examined tissue responses on the wall of the recipient vessel opposite the anastomosis site (the bed), where unusual hemodynamic forces are imposed.\nThree months after surgery, intimal thickening was observed on the upstream portion of the acute, and more rarely, the intermediate anastomoses only. Medial thinning caused by loss of cells and matrix, and an aneurysm-like dilation, was observed in the right angle and some intermediate anastomoses, but not in the acute anastomoses. En face confocal microscopy at 3 weeks after surgery revealed severe disruption of the internal elastic lamina in all anastomotic models. Zymography and Western immunoblotting demonstrated gelatinolytic activity, caused by expression and activation of MMP-2, that was lowest in the acute anastomoses, higher in the intermediate anastomoses, and highest in the right-angle anastomoses.\nWe infer that very different pathologic changes to the vessel wall are elicited when local hemodynamics is manipulated by altering the anastomotic branch angle.",

    "abstract": "Our previous computer models suggested that intraluminal thrombus (ILT) within an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) attenuates oxygen diffusion to the AAA wall, possibly causing localized hypoxia and contributing to wall weakening. The purpose of this work was to investigate this possibility.\nIn one arm of this study, patients with AAA were placed in one of two groups: (1) those with an ILT of 4-mm or greater thickness on the anterior surface or (2) those with little (< 4 mm) or no ILT at this site. During surgical resection but before aortic cross-clamping, a needle-type polarographic partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) electrode was inserted into the wall of the exposed AAA, and the PO2 was measured. The probe was advanced, and measurements were made midway through the thrombus and in the lumen. Mural and mid-ILT PO2 measurements were normalized by the intraluminal PO2 measurement to account for patient variability. In the second arm of this study, two AAA wall specimens were obtained from two different sites of the same aneurysm at the time of surgical resection: group I specimens had thick adherent ILT, and group II specimens had thinner or no adherent ILT. Nonaneurysmal tissue was also obtained from the infrarenal aorta of organ donors. Specimens were subjected to histologic, immunohistochemical, and tensile strength analyses to provide data on degree of inflammation (% area inflammatory cells), neovascularization (number of capillaries per high-power field), and tensile strength (peak attainable load). Additional specimens were subjected to Western blotting and immunohistochemistry for qualitative evaluation of expression of the cellular hypoxia marker oxygen-regulated protein.\nThe PO2 measured within the AAA wall in group I (n = 4) and group II (n = 7) patients was 18% +/- 9% luminal value versus 60% +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM; P <.01). The normalized PO2 within the ILT of group I patients was 39% +/- 10% (P =.08 with respect to the group I wall value). Group I tissue specimens showed greater inflammation (P <.05) compared with both group II specimens and nonaneurysmal tissue: 2.9% +/- 0.6% area (n = 7) versus 1.7% +/- 0.3% area (n = 7) versus 0.2% +/- 0.1% area (n = 3), respectively. We found similar differences for neovascularization (number of vessels/high-power field), but only group I versus control was significantly different (P <.05): 16.9 +/- 1.6 (n = 7) vs 13.0 +/- 2.3 (n = 7) vs 8.7 +/- 2.0 (n = 3), respectively. Both Western blotting and immunohistochemistry results suggest that oxygen-regulated protein is more abundantly expressed in group I versus group II specimens. Tensile strength of group I specimens was significantly less (P <.05) than that for group II specimens: 138 +/- 19 N/cm2 (n = 7) versus 216 +/- 34 N/cm2 (n = 7), respectively.\nOur results suggest that localized hypoxia occurs in regions of thicker ILT in AAA. This may lead to increased, localized mural neovascularization and inflammation, as well as regional wall weakening. We conclude that ILT may play an important role in the pathology and natural history of AAA.",

Each patient was linked to subsequent hospitalizations, major amputation surgery, and survival through 1999. Logistic regression and proportional hazards models were used as a means of developing risk indices on the basis of risk factors from the VA National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.

The main outcome measures were 30-day postoperative mortality and amputation-free survival.\nApproximately half of all patients had undergone an earlier revascularization or amputation at any level for vascular disease. The 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 2.1% and varied greatly between mortality risk index quartiles (0.6%-5.2%). In a median 44.3 months of follow-up, surviving patients had 17,694 subsequent VA hospitalizations, 1147 patients (26.7%) underwent subsequent major amputation, and 1913 patients (44.6%) died.

The mean age of the patients was 65 +/- 13 years, and they had a mean duration of diabetes mellitus of 33 +/- 6 years. The tcPO2 was measured at a reference point at the chest (I2 dx), the dorsum of the foot, and in the first intermetatarsal space. Measurements of tcPO2 in the first intermetatarsal space were performed before and during inhalation of 100% oxygen.\nThe mean tcPO2 was higher (P <.001) at I2 dx (56 +/- 10 mm Hg) than at the dorsum of the foot (25 +/- 19 mm Hg) and first intermetatarsal space (27 +/- 20 mm Hg). tcPO2 increased (P <.001) during inhalation of 100% oxygen, whereas the increase was severely reduced in three patients with tcPO2 less than 10 mm Hg at baseline. A reasonably good day-to-day variability of tcPO2 was seen; the linear relations between tcPO2 investigated on days 1, 2, and 3 were highly significant (P =.0001) at each measuring site, and no systematic differences were seen between the repeated measurements (analysis of variance; P =.13 to.85).\nThe results show an acceptable day-to-day variability of tcPO2, both at baseline and during oxygen inhalation, in patients with diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial occlusive disease.",

    "abstract": "There are data to suggest that the development of myointimal hyperplasia is affected by long-term alterations in blood flow. However, the clinical relevance of these findings has not been demonstrated.\nIn this retrospective clinical study, intraoperative volume flow measurement with transit time flowmeter was performed in 257 infrainguinal vein grafts carried out in 241 patients. The patients were enrolled in an intensive duplex scanning-based surveillance program. The relationship between the intraoperative graft flow and subsequent occlusion or development of stenosis was evaluated and controlled for other pertinent risk factors.\nThe median follow-up time was 13.6 months. A graft stenosis was found in 58 grafts. The mean graft flow for event-free grafts was 98 mL/min, which was significantly higher compared with 78 mL/min for stenosed or 69 mL/min for occluded grafts. The patients were divided into four groups according to quartiles of the sample distribution of graft flow measurements. The respective 2-year primary and assisted primary patency rates in the lowest to the highest graft flow groups were 39%, 49%, 47%, and 72% (P =.003) and 55%, 67%, 71%, and 84% (P =.01). Analogous significant differences were observed for maximal flow capacity measurements. Female sex (P =.009) and low graft flow in maximal flow capacity measurements (P =.003) were independent predictors of stenosis development in the multiple regression model.\nIntraoperative graft volume flow is a predictor of bypass occlusion after infrainguinal bypass. In addition, this study verifies an association between the development of clinically evident graft stenoses and low graft flow.",

    "abstract": "The driving force for blood flow through a high-grade stenosis in the internal carotid artery can be expressed as the pressure gradient over the stenosis itself, which, however, might be reduced by the back pressure exerted by distal collateral vessels. Theoretically the maximum blood flow velocity as a measure of the functional grade of obstruction may therefore be lower than what is expected from morphologic gradations of the stenosis. This study was designed to test prospectively the influence of intracranial collateral vessels on blood flow velocities within high-grade internal carotid artery stenoses.\nForty-five consecutive patients (age 66 +/- 11) with high-grade internal carotid artery stenoses were investigated before and during carotid endarterectomy. The preoperative investigations included duplex ultrasound scanning of the neck vessels, transcranial Doppler scanning for assessment of collateral flow to the middle cerebral artery and angiography. Carotid endarterectomy was performed with patients under deep general anesthesia without a shunt. Systolic and diastolic internal carotid artery blood pressures were measured before and during intraoperative cross-clamping (ie, stump pressure) of the carotid arteries.\nWithin high-grade internal carotid artery stenoses, maximum systolic and end-diastolic blood flow velocities showed a significant inverse correlation to the corresponding systolic and diastolic stump blood internal carotid artery blood pressures. All patients with spontaneous collateral flow to the ipsilateral anterior part of the circle of Willis were divided into a group with relatively high and another one with low end-diastolic blood flow velocities. The stump pressure was significantly lower in patients with high end-diastolic blood flow velocities in spite of the fact that the mean angiographic grade of stenosis did not differ significantly between the groups.\nFlow velocities within a high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis are inversely dependent on the stump pressure, that is the poststenotic collateral perfusion pressure. This should be taken into consideration in case of discrepancies between angiography and ultrasound outcome.",

    "abstract": "Several antithrombotic therapies are available for the treatment of patients with peripheral vascular diseases. It is unknown how quality of life and costs of treatment are influenced by different therapies. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of oral anticoagulants versus aspirin in patients after infrainguinal bypass grafting surgery.\nClinical outcome events and event-free survival were collected from 2650 patients in 77 centers who participated in the Dutch Bypass Oral anticoagulants or Aspirin trial. Approximately half the patients had critical ischemia; 60% received vein grafts, and 20% had femorocrural bypass grafts. A model that was primarily driven by clinical outcome events was used as a means of determining quality of life (EuroQol EQ-5D) and costs for each patient. The main outcome measure was the incremental health care costs in relation to the additional number of quality-adjusted life years and the additional number of event-free years.\nThe mean costs during the 21 months of follow-up were epsilon 6875 per patient in the oral anticoagulants group versus epsilon 7072 in the aspirin group (difference, 197; 95% CI, -746 to 343). The event-free survival was 1.10 years in the group treated with oral anticoagulants versus 1.09 years in the group treated with aspirin (difference, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.08), whereas the corresponding quality-adjusted life years were 1.06 and 1.05, respectively (difference, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.06).\nHealth care costs, event-free survival, and quality-adjusted life years in patients after infrainguinal bypass surgery were not different in patients treated with aspirin and patients treated with oral anticoagulants. The extra costs of monitoring patients treated with oral anticoagulants were limited and play no role in the decision for treatment.",

Follow-up clinical examinations and bilateral duplex reflux studies were performed for a mean period as long as 3 years. The patients were divided into two groups: group I, those with no history of a contralateral DVT, and group II, those with a history of a contralateral DVT. The patients were classified at their final examination according to the Clinical, Etiology, Anatomic, Pathophysiologic (CEAP) classification, and the ipsilateral and contralateral limbs were compared. Predisposing factors were compared with the final clinical outcome.\nSixty-three patients were monitored in a mean follow-up period of 3 years. There was a significant difference in the incidence of symptoms between the ipsilateral limbs (P <.01) and the contralateral limbs (P <.001) for both groups. There was no significant difference between the incidence of superficial reflux between the ipsilateral and contralateral limbs, but the deep venous system and perforator veins were involved more often in the ipsilateral limbs. In group I, only six patients (10%) had no evidence of venous dysfunction (CEAP = 0) in their ipsilateral or contralateral limbs at the time of the final examination, and all patients had reversible risk factors. Of patients who had a mild clinical outcome (CEAP score, 1 to 3), 64% had a healthy contralateral limb, and the remaining 36% had mild to moderate disease. Eighty percent of patients with the most severe clinical outcome (CEAP > 3) had mild to moderate venous disease in their contralateral limb and had nonreversible risk factors.\nThere are a significant number of patients with an acute DVT who had an underlying venous disease in the uninvolved contralateral limb. An ipsilateral post-thrombotic limb is more likely to develop in patients with primary venous reflux after an acute DVT. The level of venous dysfunction in the contralateral limb is an indication of the severity of disease developing in the ipsilateral limb.

Neither results from dissection nor results from sonographic examination demonstrated piercing of the MF by the SSV. A hyperechoic lamina similar to a ligament connects the SSV to the fasciae by which it is encased. An SSV tributary and collateral vessels course out of this space and are devoid of any fascial wrapping.\nThe SSV does not correspond to the classical description of a \"superficial\" vein. In fact, from the anatomical point of view, the SSV is an interfascial vein, because it is encased by two connective fasciae, just like the greater saphenous vein. Fascial relationships of the SSV suggest that muscular contraction potentially influences the caliber and hemodynamics of the SSV. In addition, the ML is arranged as a sort of mechanical shield that could counteract dilative pathologic conditions in varicose limbs.",

In 11 instances these were actually varices associated with isolated superficial system reflux or reflux originating from a distally located perforating vein. Color-coded duplex ultrasonography demonstrated saphenofemoral reflux in 75 limbs (60%), versus the 48 identified on clinical examination (P <.001), and documented that the junction ligation had not been performed incorrectly by absence of the terminal valve or any patent proximal saphenous remnant. The reflux originated at the site of the ligated saphenofemoral junction in 53 limbs (71%) and from a nearby circumjunctional deep vein in the other 22 (29%). Of the real junctional recurrences, 22 appeared as a tangled cluster, and 31 involved a single-lumen varix. Only 27 recurrences were sufficiently symptomatic to warrant consideration of additional treatment; 25 of these were clinically evident, single-lumen, true junctional recurrences.\nThis 34-year clinical follow-up study shows a 60% incidence of junctional and circumjunctional reconnections after ligation of the true saphenofemoral junction and its related tributaries. Color-coded duplex sonography is a necessary concomitant to clinical examination, detecting more recurrences and defining the pathologic anatomy to direct clinically indicated additional treatments.",

In 11 instances these were actually varices associated with isolated superficial system reflux or reflux originating from a distally located perforating vein. Color-coded duplex ultrasonography demonstrated saphenofemoral reflux in 75 limbs (60%), versus the 48 identified on clinical examination (P <.001), and documented that the junction ligation had not been performed incorrectly by absence of the terminal valve or any patent proximal saphenous remnant. The reflux originated at the site of the ligated saphenofemoral junction in 53 limbs (71%) and from a nearby circumjunctional deep vein in the other 22 (29%). Of the real junctional recurrences, 22 appeared as a tangled cluster, and 31 involved a single-lumen varix. Only 27 recurrences were sufficiently symptomatic to warrant consideration of additional treatment; 25 of these were clinically evident, single-lumen, true junctional recurrences.",

    "abstract": "We studied the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in a population with high incidences of cardiovascular diseases and analyzed how the prevalence varies according to methodology and criteria.\nAll men and women aged 65 to 75 years who lived in the Norsj\u00f6 municipality in northern Sweden were invited to undergo an ultrasound scanning (US) examination. Those with an aortic diameter of 28 mm or more or with poor visibility on US were examined with computed tomography scanning (CT). Various recommended AAA definitions, two diagnostic methods (US and CT), and two diameters (maximum and anteroposterior) were analyzed.\nOf 555 people invited to participate in the study, 504 accepted (248 men and 256 women; 91%). Eight subjects had undergone surgery for an AAA. Ninety-two subjects underwent CT. The mean maximum infrarenal aortic diameter was 24.6 mm (by means of US). Depending on diagnostic criteria, the AAA prevalence was 3.6% to 16.9% in men and 0.8% to 9.4% in women. Depending on which previous study was used as a comparison and the definition of AAA and diagnostic technique used, the prevalence in this study was 1.3 to 4.0 times higher for men and 2.0 to 5.8 times higher for women.\nIn a region in which residents have a high risk for cardiovascular disease, we found the highest prevalence of AAA ever reported within a population. The prevalence highly depends on methodology and diagnostic criteria, with a 10-fold variation. Detailed defined criteria are necessary to permit comparisons between studies: the number of individuals who have undergone surgery for AAA and whether they are included, the prevalence in 5- and 10-year age intervals, attendance rate, visibility, which diameter(s) is measured, and the prevalences with as many as possible of the four described definitions of AAA. The etiology of the high prevalence of AAA in this population needs to be investigated further.",

    "abstract": "Aneurysms of the innominate artery (AIA) are widely considered to be a rare entity. We describe our experience with AIAs in the last three decades.\nFrom October 1973 to October 2000, we operated on 27 patients with an AIA. The underlying cause of aneurysm was Takayasu's disease in 7 patients, degenerative disease in 6 patients, syphilis in 5 patients, chronic dissection in 3 patients, trauma in 2 patients, infection in 2 patients, a postoperative complication in 1 patient, and Marfan syndrome in 1 patient. AIA was associated with an aortic aneurysm in 17 patients. Fourteen patients had no symptoms. The remaining patients had symptoms, with thromboembolic complications in 7 patients, pain without rupture in 3 patients, and a ruptured aneurysm in 3 patients. In two patients at high risk for surgery who had a small AIA with embolic complications, a cervical approach was used as a means of performing distal exclusion and crossover bypass. In the remaining 25 patients, a midline sternotomy was used. One patient with a ruptured AIA exsanguinated during sternotomy. Ten patients underwent a prosthetic replacement of the ascending aorta and/or aortic arch with a separate prosthetic branch to the innominate artery (IA). Thirteen patients underwent ascending aorta-to-IA prosthetic bypass in association with lateral suture (8 patients) or prosthetic patching (5 patients) of the aorta. One patient with an infected aneurysm was treated by means of resection of the aneurysm, proximal ligation of the IA, and transposition of the right into the left common carotid artery. Cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was used in 10 patients.\nThree perioperative deaths occurred (2 of 4 in association with emergency treatment and 1 of 23 with elective treatment). Respiratory complications requiring prolonged artificial ventilation developed in five patients. Two patients had transient worsening of preoperative neurologic deficits. Late results, with a mean follow-up of 85 months, were good.\nThe etiology and presentation of AIAs are variable. Surgical management with current cardiovascular techniques achieves excellent results.",

    "abstract": "So far, endovascular surgery has been the only minimal invasive way to treat patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). With hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS), laparoscopic transperitoneal endoaneurysm repair can be performed through a 6-cm mini-incision only. We wanted to evaluate whether this laparoscopic technique can be offered as a minimal invasive alternative in patients unsuitable for endovascular AAA repair.\nForty patients were referred for endovascular AAA repair. Three patients had to be excluded from the study. Endovascular AAA exclusion was finally performed in 13 patients. Laparoscopic AAA resection was performed in 24 patients. Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery with transperitoneal access and endoaneurysm repair was accomplished in all patients unsuitable for an endovascular procedure. The outcome after endovascular repair was compared with the outcome of patients who underwent laparoscopy.\nIn the laparoscopic group, conversion to an open procedure was necessary in one case. One patient in this group died (4.1%) postoperatively. There were four complications in each group. In the endovascular group we had one endoleak type II and one graft thrombosis, which required a reoperation. After endovascular treatment, patients were transferred significantly less frequently to the intensive care unit, and they could resume oral feeding earlier. Mobilization and postoperative hospital stay did not differ significantly between the groups.\nLaparoscopic AAA resection with the use of the technique described can be routinely offered to patients unsuitable for endovascular AAA exclusion with excellent long-term results similar to open surgery. A controlled study is clearly indicated to evaluate the role of laparoscopic techniques in aneurysm surgery.",

    "abstract": "Chlamydia Pneumoniae has been shown to be associated with atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). The possible association between AAA expansion and C pneumoniae infection was therefore assessed.\nBlood samples were taken from patients with an AAA that was considered for surgical repair after having been diagnosed by means of the Chichester aneurysm screening program (UK) as having an initially infrarenal aortic diameter of 3.0 to 5.9 cm. The patients were examined prospectively for as long as 11.5 years (mean, 4.1 years) with ultrasound scanning. Of 110 patients considered for surgery, 90 men and 10 women had blood samples taken. Their IgG and IgA antibodies against C pneumoniae were measured by means of a microimmunofluorescence test. Unpaired t tests, multiple linear regression analyses, and logistic regression analyses were used for statistical analysis.\nA total of 44% (95% CI, 31%-55%) of the men with an AAA had an IgA titer of 64 or more, an IgG titer of 128 or more, or both, compared with 10% of the women with an AAA (OR = 7.2; 95% CI, 1.05-160.8). A titer of IgG of 128 or more was significantly associated with higher expansion (5.3 vs 2.6 mm per year), even after adjustment for initial AAA size and age.

    "abstract": "The safety of intentional occlusion of patent internal iliac arteries (IIAs) to facilitate the endovascular repair of aortoiliac artery aneurysms (abdominal aortic aneurysms [AAAs] and iliac aneurysms [IAs]) was evaluated.\nWe analyzed the techniques and clinical sequelae of selective occlusion of one or both IIAs in 103 patients and correlated these findings with the results of preoperative angiograms to identify vascular anatomy that may predict postoperative pelvic ischemia. To quantify the clinical presentation of pelvic ischemia, we developed these criteria: class 0, no symptoms; class I, nonlimiting claudication with exercise; class II, new onset impotence, with or without moderate to severe buttock pain, leading to physical limitation with exercise; class III, buttock rest pain, colonic ischemia, or both. IIA occlusion was achieved in 100% of the patients by means of either catheter-directed embolization or orificial coverage with a stent-graft. No patient in this study had angiographic evidence of significant visceral occlusive disease before the procedure. Sixty-four patients had isolated AAAs, 23 patients had AAAs and IAs, and 16 patients had isolated IAs. Ninety-two patients had one IIA selectively occluded, and 11 patients had both IIAs selectively occluded.\nAfter IIA occlusion, 12 patients were categorized in class I, 9 patients were categorized in class II, and 1 patient was categorized in class III, for a total of 22 patients (21%) with pelvic ischemia. Sixteen (17%) of 92 patients had unilateral IIA occlusions, and six (17%) of 11 patients had bilateral IIA occlusions. Five patients in class I improved and had no symptoms within 1 year, and one patient in class II was downgraded to class I because of improved symptoms. Two unique preoperative angiographic findings were identified in the remaining 16 patients (16%) with chronic pelvic claudication: (1) stenosis of the remaining IIA origin (> 70%) with nonopacification of more than three of the six IIA branches (63%); and (2) small caliber, diseased or absent medial and lateral femoral circumflex arteries ipsilateral to the side of the IIA occlusion (25%). One patient with class III ischemia died of cardiovascular collapse associated with colon infarction caused by either acute ischemia or particulate embolization.\nThe incidence of pelvic ischemia after IIA occlusion is 20% immediately after endovascular aortoiliac aneurysm repair. A total of 25% of patients had no symptoms within 1 year. Two preoperative radiologic findings may help identify patients who are at risk for pelvic ischemia: stenosis of the patent IIA and disease deep femoral ascending branches ipsilateral to the occluded IIA. The risk of colon ischemia appears to be small after selective IIA occlusion to facilitate endovascular AAA repair.",

    "abstract": "Endoluminal stent-graft placement for the treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms has gained widespread acceptance because it is associated with lower peri-interventional morbidity than conventional transabdominal surgery. In this study the long-term morbidity of the procedure was evaluated.\nBetween September 1994 and December 1998, 150 patients (age, 69.6 +/- 8.49 years; 142 men, 8 women) with abdominal aortic aneurysms were treated with the placement of an intravascular nitinol stent-graft (Stentor [55] and Vanguard-System [95]); there were eight tubular grafts and 142 bifurcated grafts. Initial placement of the stent-graft was successful in 144 patients. Mean follow-up was 49 +/- 25 months. In 13.3% of stent-graft placements we encountered the following complications: 4 cases of migration or dislocation of the prosthesis (30.5 +/- 7.4 months after placement); 2 ruptures of the aorta (26.7 and 15.0 months after placement); 3 recurrent thromboses of the stent-graft (25.5 +/- 5.3 months after placement); 3 endoleaks (27.5 +/- 15.7 months after placement); and 5 infections of the prosthesis (26.6 +/- 16.5 months after placement). There was no correlation between the complications and the type of stent used. All of these patients were treated by surgical replacement of the prosthesis with a Dacron graft.\n(1) The results suggest that most complications are due to a continuation of the disease process leading to loosening of the prosthesis. (2) Explantation of the prosthesis and surgical repair is feasible but bears additional risks. (3) Because the onset of reperfusion of the excluded aneurysm cannot be predicted, all patients with infrarenal aortic stent-grafts require frequent computer tomographic follow-up. (4) Finally, the results call for further improvements in the design of the stent-graft.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this report is to describe an interesting cause of endoleak and detail-specific techniques for identifying small transgraft defects, which we have termed microleaks.\nFour patients underwent endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms with modular nitinol/polyester endoprostheses and were studied after 6 to 30 months. All patients were enrolled in standard follow-up radiographic surveillance protocols.\nThree of the four abdominal aortic aneurysms continued to expand after endograft repair. Standard computed tomography imaging with precontrast, dynamic contrast, and delayed imaging frequently identifies endoleak, although it fails to precisely identify microleaks as the source. Color flow duplex ultrasound scan was performed on three patients and perigraft \"jets,\" small areas of color flow adjacent to the endograft, were identified in all. Microleaks were identified in one patient who underwent digital subtraction arteriography with directed efforts to completely opacify the prosthesis lumen and multiple oblique projections. In another patient, contrast arteriography with balloon occlusion of the distal endograft clearly depicted midgraft microleaks that might otherwise be mistaken for graft porosity or cuff junction endoleaks. No microleaks were diagnosed on angiograms when these directed efforts were not performed. Aneurysm exploration before aortic clamping provided conclusive determination of the presence of blood flow through the wall of the endoprosthesis in two patients.\nMicroleaks occur up to 2.5 years after endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms. Although computed tomography demonstrates the presence of an endoleak in these patients, the exact site of origin usually remains obscure. Doppler ultrasound scan and directed arteriography appear to be of greater utility for identifying the presence and location of microleaks. Balloon occlusion arteriography and aneurysm exploration without arterial clamping provide definitive evidence of microleaks. Although the clinical significance of microleaks remains unclear, long-term monitoring of patients is imperative to diagnose and treat these and other modes of endograft failure before they progress to aneurysm rupture.",

Once the optical fiber is withdrawn, the Endostaple assumes its preformed shape and acts like a through-and-through wire suture. As tissue ingrowth proceeds, the long-term security and stabilization of the coiled coil mechanism are likely to increase.\nWe think Endostaples can be useful in preventing endograft migration and in treating endoleak at the site of the aortic neck-proximal endograft interface.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophil transendothelial migration, a key feature of skeletal muscle ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury, is mediated by the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). Peroxynitrite anion, a toxic product of neutrophil superoxide anion and nitric oxide, contributes to oxidative skeletal muscle injury and can be quantified by measurement of protein tyrosine nitration after I/R. This study hypothesizes that administration of the PECAM-1/IgG antibody chimera will inhibit peroxynitrite-mediated injury after I/R.\nThe study was composed of five groups: an I/R group (n = 4), a sham treatment group anesthetic control (n = 3), a treatment group receiving the PECAM-1/immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody chimera with I/R (n = 9), a treatment group receiving human IgG with I/R as an antibody control (n = 6), and a treatment group receiving normal saline solution with I/R as a vehicle control (n = 5). The right hind limb in male New Zealand white rabbits was rendered ischemic by occluding the iliac and femoral arteries for 3 hours, followed by 2 hours of reperfusion (I/R). Sham-treated rabbits underwent arterial dissection without arterial occlusion. PECAM-1/IgG-treated rabbits and IgG-treated rabbits received an infusion of 1 mg/kg in normal saline solution 20 mL via an ear vein catheter during the last 5 minutes of ischemia and the first 15 minutes of reperfusion. Saline solution-treated rabbits similarly received normal saline solution 20 mL. The anterior tibialis muscle was harvested after reperfusion. Immunohistochemical staining for nitrotyrosine was performed with monoclonal antinitrotyrosine antibodies and fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. Computed morphometric study was performed to calculate relative fluorescence scores for each histologic section. Averaged fluorescence scores were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc comparison.\nThe averaged fluorescence scores (mean +/- SEM) for the sham-treated (2.88 +/- 0.78) and PECAM-1/IgG-treated (6.16 +/- 0.43) groups demonstrated a significant reduction in quantitative fluorescence compared with the IgG- (15.17 +/- 2.01) and saline solution-treated (17.46 +/- 3.71) control groups, and the I/R-treated (18.52 +/- 3.00) group, (P <.05).\nThese results suggest that PECAM-1/IgG diminishes peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative skeletal muscle injury by inhibiting neutrophil transendothelial migration and may therefore prove a useful therapeutic agent in the treatment of reperfusion injury.",

    "abstract": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been implicated in a variety of vascular pathologic conditions, although there is considerable controversy as to whether such effects are mediated by the ET-(A) or ET-(B) receptor. This study investigated whether inhibition of big ET-1 processing by inhibition of endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) could, therefore, offer an alternative therapeutic strategy in the prevention of vein graft intimal hyperplasia.\nHuman saphenous vein (3 equal segments from 10 patients) were maintained in organ culture for 14 days with either 50 micromol/L CGS 26303 (a dual ECE/neutral endopeptidase [NEP] inhibitor), 50 micromol/L CGS 24592 (a selective NEP inhibitor), or vehicle (control).

    "abstract": "Regression of atherosclerotic lesions is an important goal. No extensive experimental evidence shows that it can be achieved for advanced lesions. To study this, we developed a model to maintain a long-term change in the plasma lipoprotein environment of advanced arterial lesions of hyperlipidemic (apolipoprotein E [apoE]-deficient) mice.\nThe apoE-deficient mice (plasma total cholesterol of 1334 +/- 219 [+/- SEM] mg/dL) on a typical Western diet for 38 weeks had advanced atherosclerotic lesions (ie, beyond the macrophage foam cell stage) throughout the arterial tree. Lesion-containing thoracic aortas were transplanted (replacing a segment of abdominal aorta) into either apoE-deficient or wild-type (WT) (total cholesterol of 86 +/- 10 mg/dL) recipients. Grafts were harvested after 9 weeks.\nCompared with pretransplant lesions (area = 0.0892 +/- 0.0179 mm(2)), lesion size tended to increase in apoE-deficient to apoE-deficient grafts (0.2411 +/- 0.0636 mm(2); P =.06), whereas a significant reduction was seen in apoE-deficient to WT grafts (0.0214 +/- 0.0049 mm(2); P <.001). Also, foam cells were absent in apoE-deficient to WT grafts, but abundant in pretransplant lesions and apoE-deficient to apoE-deficient grafts. Grafts were evaluated noninvasively in vivo with magnetic resonance imaging, and wall thickening was detected in the apoE-deficient to apoE-deficient group.\nNearly complete regression of advanced atherosclerotic lesions can be achieved with sustained normalization of the plasma lipoprotein profile. Syngeneic arterial transplantation in mice is a novel and valuable model system for atherosclerosis research; and magnetic resonance imaging can detect differences in characteristics in lesions undergoing regression.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular superficial femoral artery (SFA) endarterectomy with a ring stripper/cutter and distal stenting has been suggested to have a patency comparable with above-knee bypass surgery. We report our initial experience with this technique.\nSeventeen patients (13 men and 4 women; mean age, 64 years) with SFA occlusion and above-knee popliteal reconstitution underwent attempted remote endarterectomy with a ring cutter system combined with primary stenting of the distal end point. Analysis was performed in a prospective manner with patency rates determined by Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis.\nThe indication for operation was claudication in 8 patients, rest pain in 6, and tissue loss in 3. Initial technical success was achieved in 11 patients (65%). Reasons for technical failure included SFA perforation (4), inability to traverse a calcified/diseased segment (1), and inability to retract/remove the ring cutter (1). Life-table analysis of all patients revealed a primary patency at 1 year of 26% +/- 11%. Primary-assisted patency was 38% +/- 12% at 1 year, with 59% of patients ultimately requiring surgical bypass grafting. In patients in whom initial technical success was achieved, the 1-year primary and primary-assisted patency rates were 40% and 59%, respectively. There were four reocclusions requiring surgical revascularization with below-knee popliteal (2) or tibial (2) bypass grafting, 1 symptomatic restenosis requiring repeat angioplasty, and 1 symptomatic restenosis treated conservatively.\nThe results of endovascular SFA endarterectomy were disappointing, with technical success in less than two thirds of patients and a 1-year primary patency of only 26%. Remote SFA endarterectomy appears less effective than above-knee femoropopliteal bypass grafting, and after early failure, patients may require more distal revascularization for limb salvage.",

In this report, we describe a significant, previously unreported complication following stent-graft repair of acute aortic dissection.\nFourteen patients with acute aortic dissection underwent stent-graft repair. All of the entry tears were located in the descending thoracic aorta. Five patients had type A aortic dissection, and nine patients had type B aortic dissection. The entry tears were closed with stent-grafts, which were fabricated from expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and Z-stents.\nStent-graft placement was successfully performed without any complications in all patients. Entry closure was achieved in 13 (93%) of 14 patients. The mean follow-up period was 18 months (range, 9 days to 36 months). During this period, four patients had saccular aneurysms in the proximal descending thoracic aorta. A saccular aneurysm was noted during a mean follow-up period of 63 days (range, 38-99 days). Two of these patients were treated with stent-grafts. Conventional surgical repair is planned in one patient. The other patient is being treated with conservative management.\nStent-graft repair is a technically feasible and effective method for the treatment of acute aortic dissection in selected patients. However, careful follow-up is mandatory to check for the development of saccular aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Standard surgical repair of para-anastamotic aneurysms (PAAs) of the abdominal and thoracic aorta and the iliac arteries has been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. We reviewed our continuing experience with endovascular repair of these lesions to determine whether this approach is favorable and durable.\nAll patients with PAAs of the aorta or iliac arteries who underwent endovascular treatment of their lesions between August 1993 and July 1999 were prospectively followed up, and data on age, previous aortic pathology and surgery, size of PAA, time to diagnosis, and symptoms at presentation were recorded. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative imaging studies were analyzed. All patients had endovascular stent-grafts placed under digital fluoroscopic guidance in the operating room. Data on intraoperative and postoperative complications, mortality, and endoleaks were reviewed.\nFrom August 1993 to July 1999, 28 patients (20 men, 8 women) had 35 PAAs of the aorta or iliac arteries. There were 5 thoracic aortic, 12 abdominal aortic, and 18 iliac artery PAAs. Three patients had a contained rupture of their PAA. All patients who had originally undergone reconstruction for occlusive disease had lesions consistent with false aneurysms, whereas 73% of the aortic or iliac PAAs in patients originally treated for aneurysm disease appeared to be true aneurysms. Thirty-four of 35 PAAs were successfully excluded with stent-grafts (97%). There was one death at 30 days (3.6%) in a patient who was successfully treated endovascularly for a contained rupture of a thoracic PAA. There were four major postoperative complications (14.2%) in the 28 patients who were treated. One patient had continued perfusion of a thoracic aortic PAA (type I endoleak). The in-hospital length of stay after endovascular repair of PAA was 4 days (range, 1-18 days). The mean follow-up period was 21 months (range, 1-68 months).\nEndovascular repair of aortic and iliac artery PAAs is technically feasible and provides a high rate of lesion exclusion. Morbidity and mortality rates appear lower than those reported for open surgical repair. These patients can typically be discharged by the second postoperative day. Endovascular therapy for stable ruptured PAAs can be successfully performed and should be considered as an option only when appropriate devices and expertise are available. For uncomplicated PAAs of the aorta and iliac arteries, endovascular therapy may be more favorable than surgical repair.",

    "abstract": "This report describes our initial experience with the modular, bifurcated Excluder endoprosthesis and its safety and efficacy in the primary endovascular repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).\nAAAs (mean diameter, 58.2 +/- 14.3 mm) were repaired in 19 patients with this device between March 1999 and January 2000. The mean age of patients was 71.8 +/- 8.4 years (range, 57-86 years). This modular device was inserted through an 18F introducer sheath placed in one femoral artery, and the contralateral artery was cannulated with a 12F introducer sheath. All procedures were performed in a standard operating room with angiographic capabilities.\nEndograft deployment was successful in all patients. The average surgical time was 135 +/- 37 minutes, with a mean blood loss of 229 +/- 138 mL. In eight patients, the use of either aortic or iliac extenders was required for enhanced sealing or additional length. An external iliac artery dissection occurring at the time of endograft insertion was successfully treated with a Wallstent. Type II leaks initially found to be present by means of intraoperative completion angiography had spontaneously thrombosed by the 1-month follow-up computed tomography scan. There was one perioperative death (5.3%). Complications included superficial wound infections (n = 3) and a nonfatal myocardial infarction (n = 1). The mean length of hospital stay was 2.9 +/- 1.2 days, and only six patients required intensive care. Endoleaks were seen in four patients (21%) by means of the 30-day computed tomography scan; three of these endoleaks had spontaneously sealed at the time of the 6-month follow-up examination (5.5% 6-month endoleak rate). Aneurysm size did not increase in the patients with leaks.\nThe Excluder endoprosthesis was an effective means of excluding an infrarenal AAA from the systemic circulation in this selected group of patients. The smaller sheath sizes may increase the pool of potential candidates. Further study of this device is warranted, and continued assessment of the long-term durability of the device will be necessary.",

    "abstract": "The initial purpose of this study was to determine the effects of intravascular adenoviral vector-mediated gene transfer of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (AdeNOS) on experimental hindlimb ischemia in the rat. Unexpectedly, administration of AdeNOS immediately after induction of acute limb ischemia led to limb gangrene. We subsequently sought to define the molecular mechanisms responsible for this unusual effect and to devise adenoviral gene transfer strategies to prevent the development of gangrene in acutely ischemic limbs.\nPhosphate-buffered saline or adenoviral vectors containing the bovine endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene (AdeNOS) or no transgene (Ad-E1) were injected intra-arterially into the hindlimb of a rat under vascular isolation immediately after surgical induction of severe ischemia. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed on muscle sections to evaluate inflammation. A separate group of animals was injected with an adenovirus containing a nontranscribable genome, treated with cyclosporine, or received delayed administration of the adenoviral vector. Gene expression after delayed adenoviral gene transfer was assessed with immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity assay.\nBoth AdeNOS and Ad-E1 caused gangrene of the entire hindlimb within 12 days in a dose-dependent manner, at a threshold concentration of 1 x 10(9) plaque-forming unit/mL. Adenoviral delivery was associated with more inflammation and edema compared with phosphate-buffered saline histologically. Inactivation of adenoviral DNA transcription did not affect induction of gangrene. However, gangrene was prevented by concurrent immunosuppression with cyclosporine or delayed administration of the vector. Delayed administration allowed adenoviral gene expression as determined by immunohistochemistry, NOS protein levels, and an assay of NOS enzyme activity.\nIntra-arterial administration of adenoviral vectors, under vascular isolation, immediately after induction of acute ischemia causes inflammation and subsequent limb gangrene. The inflammatory response is unrelated to the expression of the recombinant transgene or the adenoviral genome and is likely due to the adenoviral capsid proteins. However, administration of cyclosporine or delayed injection of the adenoviral vector is a method that can be used for adenoviral mediated gene transfer in limb ischemia.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesized that systemic ATL-146e, an adenosine A(2A) agonist, would decrease spinal cord reperfusion inflammatory stress and inhibit apoptosis and that these effects would correlate with improved neurologic functional outcome.\nThirty rabbits underwent cross-clamping of the infrarenal aorta for 45 minutes. One group of animals (n = 14) received 0.06 microg/kg per minute of ATL-146e infused intravenously for 3 hours, beginning 15 minutes before reperfusion. A second group of animals (n = 16) underwent spinal cord ischemia with saline vehicle alone and served as ischemic controls. Animals (n = 9, 11) from each group survived for 48 hours and assessed for neurologic impairment with the Tarlov (0-5) scoring system. Four animals from each group were humanely killed at the end of the 3-hour treatment period, and the remainder killed after 48 hours' survival. In all animals, lumbar spinal cord tissue specimens were frozen for subsequent Western blot analysis of heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70), and for the p85 fragment of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Neuronal viability indices were determined at 48 hours with hematoxylin and eosin staining.\nThere was improvement in neurologic function in rabbits receiving ATL-146e (P <.001) compared with ischemic controls. At the end of the 3-hour treatment period there was a 46% (P <.05) decrease in HSP 70 expression in the ATL-146e group compared with the control group, but no difference in PARP expression. At 48 hours, there was no difference between control and ATL-146e groups in HSP 70 expression, but there was a 65% (P <.05) reduction in PARP in the spinal cords of animals that had received ATL-146e. There was a significant improvement in neuronal viability indices in animals receiving ATL-146e compared with ischemic controls (P <.05).\nSystemic ATL-146e infusion during reperfusion after spinal cord ischemia results in preservation of hindlimb motor function. There is evidence of decreased spinal cord inflammatory stress immediately after treatment with ATL-146e as indicated by reduced HSP 70 induction. Treatment with ATL-146e is associated with a reduction in neuronal apoptosis as suggested by a substantial decrease in the fragmentation of PARP at 48 hours. These results suggest that inflammation during reperfusion and subsequent apoptosis contribute to paralysis after restoration of blood flow to the ischemic spinal cord.",

    "abstract": "Hyperhomocysteinemia has been implicated as a causative factor in intimal hyperplasia development. The addition of dietary folate in a hyperhomocysteinemia, carotid endarterectomy rat model is postulated to decrease plasma homocysteine levels and, in turn, reduce post-carotid endarterectomy intimal hyperplasia.\nEach rat was fed one of six diets: (1) lab chow with no folate (n = 7), (2) lab chow with 10 mg/kg folate added (n = 3), (3) lab chow with 25 mg/kg folate added (n = 3), (4) a homocysteine diet with no folate (n = 7), (5) a homocysteine diet with 10 mg/kg folate added (n = 5), or (6) homocysteine diet with 25 mg/kg folate added (n = 5). Each rat then underwent an open carotid endarterectomy. In 2 weeks, intimal hyperplasia in the carotid artery was measured. Plasma homocysteine and folate levels were measured.\nPlasma folate levels rose with folate administration. Plasma homocysteine in the lab chow group was 5.4 +/- 0.5 micromol/L and did not change with the addition of folate. In the homocysteine diet group, plasma homocysteine rose 10-fold over the lab chow group (51.9 +/- 6.5 vs 5.4 +/- 0.5, micromol/L, P <.0001). In the group fed a homocysteine diet with 10 mg/kg folate added, a significant decrease in plasma homocysteine was observed (17.5 +/- 8.5 vs 51.9 +/- 6.5, micromol/L, P =.0003). In the group fed a homocysteine diet with 25 mg/kg folate added, plasma homocysteine levels were further reduced to levels seen in the lab chow group (12.6 +/- 2.6 vs 5.4 +/- 0.5, micromol/L, P = not significant). The relationship between plasma folate and homocysteine was inverse (R = 0.39, P =.0036). Luminal stenosis due to intimal hyperplasia was minimal in lab chow groups and unaffected by folate. The homocysteine diet group demonstrated post-carotid endarterectomy luminal stenosis due to intimal hyperplasia (60.9% +/- 9.2%). In the group fed a homocysteine diet with 10 mg/kg folate added, intimal hyperplasia was reduced, compared with the homocysteine diet group (32.6% +/- 7.4% vs 60.9% +/- 9.2%, P =.009). In the group fed a homocysteine diet with 25 mg/kg folate added, intimal hyperplasia was reduced to lab chow group levels (10.8% +/- 0.8% vs 4.8% +/- 1.0%, P = not significant) and was reduced, compared with the group fed a homocysteine diet with 10 mg/kg folate added.\nThe use of folate in this hyperhomocysteinemia carotid endarterectomy model and the resultant attenuation of plasma homocysteine elevation and intimal hyperplasia development lend strong support to homocysteine being an independent etiologic factor in post-carotid endarterectomy intimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare in a randomized, prospective, and controlled study, the performance of a multilayered, self-sealing polyurethane vascular access graft (PVAG) and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular access grafts in hemodialysis applications. Performance measures included graft survival, complications, time to early cannulation, and hemostasis times after cannulation.\nA total of 142 patients were randomized equally to receive one of the two grafts after meeting all eligibility requirements. All patients were followed up prospectively to 12 months or to the end of secondary patency. Specifically, this study documented the performance of the PVAG and ePTFE grafts by determining the patencies and complications for both grafts.\nPatient characteristics between the two groups were similar with respect to risk factors and demographic characteristics (P >.05). Life-table patencies from the date of first dialysis were primary patency: PVAG 55% versus ePTFE 47% (6 months) and PVAG 44% versus ePTFE 36% (12 months) and secondary patency: PVAG 87% versus ePTFE 90% (6 months) and PVAG 78% versus ePTFE 80% (12 months). None of these differences were significant (P >.05). Both primary and secondary patencies were also not significantly different when the date of implantation was the starting point. Adverse events and complications were similar for the two groups, except the PVAG group had a higher incidence of technical complications manifested by graft kinking when compared with the control cohort (P <.05). Additionally, there was no significant difference in complication rates between these two groups with regard to infection and bleeding. When the time to hemostasis after cannulation was compared at 5minutes or less, there were more PVAG cannulation sites that achieved hemostasis compared with ePTFE sites, and this difference was significant (P <.0001). When time to first dialysis access was compared between the two grafts, 53.9% of all PVAG grafts were cannulated before 9 days versus none with the ePTFE grafts (P <.001). However, long-term graft survival was not significantly different when PVAG patients were stratified into early (< 9 days) and the late access (9 >/= days) groups (P =.29).\nThe PVAG graft allows for early access without compromising long-term performance. Both PVAG and standard ePTFE grafts have similar long-term outcomes, despite early access with the PVAG vascular access grafts.",

    "abstract": "The five pneumatic compression devices (PCDs) that are marketed provide mechanical protection from deep venous thrombosis (DVT). They differ with respect to patterns of compression and the length of the sleeve. Evidence linking differences to clinical outcomes is lacking. Our purpose was twofold: to evaluate each of the marketed PCDs with respect to effectiveness, compliance, and patient and nursing satisfaction and to determine whether there is a clinical basis for the selection of one device over another.\nEach of the marketed devices was used exclusively for a 4-week period. Patients participated in an evaluation including venous duplex ultrasound scan, DVT risk assessment, and device evaluation. Vascular laboratory records were used to document DVT. Compliance was measured by meters installed on all pumps. A ranking matrix was stratified by compression pattern: rapid graduated sequential compression, graduated compression, and intermittent compression, and each device was rated by patients and nurses.\nThe PCDs were used in 1350 cases with a DVT rate of 3.5% ranging from 2% to 9.8% depending on the method of compression. Patients with DVT were older (58 vs 54 years), had better compliance (67% vs 50%), and had more compression days (11 vs 7.2). When thigh-length sleeves were used, a greater proportion of DVT occurred in the proximal segments (71%) as compared with the number of proximal DVT when the calf-length devices were used (52%; P =.21). Devices W, X, and Y had comparable rates of DVT, which were lower than those for V and Z. Compression device W, [correction] with calf and thigh sleeves, achieved the best overall ranking largely because of high scores for patient and nurse satisfaction.\nOur data appear at odds with commonly held beliefs. We were unable to show a difference in DVT incidence based on the length of the device or the method of compression. Randomized studies are needed to confirm our findings and evaluate hypotheses derived from this study.",

    "abstract": "Despite numerous studies in which various methods for arteriotomy closure after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) have been addressed, the optimum surgical technique to reduce complications and late carotid restenosis has yet to be firmly established. The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the results of the eversion CEA technique with those of conventional CEA with either primary closure or carotid patch angioplasty, and to determine under clinical conditions whether eversion CEA influences the results and restenosis rate.\nOver a 3-year period, 322 CEAs performed on 296 consecutive patients were concurrently evaluated. This study included 118 eversion CEAs, 97 CEAs with primary closure, and 107 CEAs with patch angioplasty. There were no differences in demographics, in surgical indications, or in the severity of carotid disease (not significant [NS]). The choice of CEA technique was not randomized because of technical considerations and surgeon preference. After entry into the protocol, no patients were excluded or withdrawn. Carotid restenosis was defined as a > 60% lumen reduction at the CEA site with established duplex ultrasonography criteria.\nThe mean operative time for eversion CEA was 31 minutes, for CEA-primary closure it was 39 minutes, and for CEA-patch angioplasty it was 46 minutes (P <.01). The operative mortality rate for eversion CEA was 0.8% (1 patient), for CEA-primary closure it was 1.0% (1 patient), and for CEA-patch angioplasty it was 2.8% (3 patients) (NS). The postoperative stroke rate was 0.8% after eversion CEA, 1.0% after CEA-primary closure, and 2.8% after CEA-patch angioplasty (NS). The combined stroke and death rate in each group was thus 0.8% for eversion CEA (1 stroke-death), 1% for CEA with primary closure (1 stroke-death), and 5% for CEA with patch angioplasty (1 stroke-death, 2 fatal myocardial infarctions, and 2 nonfatal strokes) (NS). Transient ischemic attacks occurred in 2.5% after eversion CEA, in 5.2% after CEA-primary closure, and in 2.9% with CEA-patch angioplasty (NS). The mean clinical follow-up for all three groups was 23 months (range, 6-42 months) (NS). The restenosis rate was 1.7% after eversion CEA, 9.3% after CEA-primary closure, and 6.5% after CEA-patch angioplasty (P <.05).\nThis prospective, nonrandomized clinical study indicates that eversion CEA is an effective surgical option comparable to conventional CEA with either primary arteriotomy closure or carotid patch angioplasty. No differences were found between eversion CEA and these more widely accepted CEA closure techniques with respect to operative morbidity and mortality. These data indicate, however, that eversion CEA has a lower restenosis rate than conventional CEA closure techniques and thus superior long-term durability.",

    "abstract": "The value of surveillance venous duplex scanning for detecting unsuspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in trauma patients who are receiving enoxaparin prophylaxis is open to question. This study was undertaken to determine whether enoxaparin reduced the clinical utility of surveillance scanning and whether management of these patients was altered by findings of the scans.\nThe medical records of trauma patients who met defined criteria for high DVT risk, admitted during 30 consecutive months, were reviewed. These patients received enoxaparin 30 mg every 12 hours for the duration of their admissions. Per protocol, surveillance lower extremity venous duplex scans were performed within 72 hours of enoxaparin administration and then weekly until patients were discharged from the hospital. The records were reviewed for thromboembolic events (DVT or pulmonary embolism [PE]), patient location and ambulatory status, therapeutic interventions (systemic anticoagulation, vena cava filter), and complications of enoxaparin therapy.\nA total 241 patients underwent 513 venous duplex examinations (1-13 per patient). Eight patients had DVT on the initial scan; seven of these patients were asymptomatic. Five were treated with anticoagulation and/or vena cava filter placement. Of the 233 patients with initially negative duplex scan results, five patients (2%) developed clinically unsuspected lower extremity DVT while hospitalized. All of these five patients were in an intensive care unit. Three of the five patients had no change in treatment. Two of the five underwent anticoagulation, and one vena cava filter was placed. PE occurred in two hospitalized patients, one of whom was ambulatory, with negative duplex scan results. After hospital discharge, six other patients had symptomatic DVT or PE despite in-hospital scans with negative results. Complications associated with enoxaparin included hemorrhage (2) and thrombocytopenia (8).\nAfter initial negative scan results, repeat surveillance duplex scanning during hospitalization detected a low incidence (2%) of DVT in high-risk patients. Furthermore, the detection of unsuspected DVT altered the clinical management of less than 1% of the patients tested. Thus, after a venous duplex scan with negative results and initiation of enoxaparin prophylaxis, subsequent surveillance duplex examinations are not warranted in asymptomatic trauma patients.",

Of the 233 patients with initially negative duplex scan results, five patients (2%) developed clinically unsuspected lower extremity DVT while hospitalized. All of these five patients were in an intensive care unit. Three of the five patients had no change in treatment. Two of the five underwent anticoagulation, and one vena cava filter was placed. PE occurred in two hospitalized patients, one of whom was ambulatory, with negative duplex scan results. After hospital discharge, six other patients had symptomatic DVT or PE despite in-hospital scans with negative results. Complications associated with enoxaparin included hemorrhage (2) and thrombocytopenia (8).",

    "abstract": "The effect of anatomic location of stent placement on the outcome of iliac artery angioplasty and stenting is not defined. Analyses of patency rates of external iliac artery (EIA) and common iliac artery (CIA) stents have provided conflicting results and have not considered men and women independently. The purpose of this study was to estimate the influence of the anatomic location of stenting on the outcome of iliac angioplasty and stent placement in both men and women.\nFrom 1995 to 1999, 247 iliac angioplasty and stent placement procedures (303 stents) were performed in 67 women and 122 men, and all were included in a retrospective cohort study. The criteria prepared by the Ad Hoc Committee on Reporting Standards (Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery) were followed. The TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus classification was used to characterize the type of iliac lesions. Both univariate (Kaplan-Meier [KM]) and multivariate analyses (Cox proportional hazards model) were used to determine the association among the variables, cumulative patency, limb salvage, and survival.\nIndications for iliac angioplasty with stenting were disabling claudication (65%), limb salvage (33%), and blue toe syndrome (2%). Primary stenting was performed in 103 procedures (42%). Stents were placed selectively after iliac angioplasty mainly for residual stenosis or pressure gradient (43%). Patients with EIA stents, as compared with those who had CIA stents, had more extensive lesions (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus type C lesions), poorer runoff, smaller vessel size, and less frequency of hyperlipidemia (P <.05). Primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 76%, 56%, and 56%, respectively, for patients with EIA stents and 92%, 85%, and 76%, respectively, for those with CIA stents. Although overall primary patency rates were significantly decreased in patients with EIA lesions (KM, log-rank test, P =.001), stratified analyses revealed that women with EIA stents had the poorest outcome, with 61%, 47%, and 23% primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, (KM, log-rank test, P <.001). Cox regression analysis identified EIA stenting (relative risk, 4.3; 95% CI, 2.3-7.9; P <.001) as an independent predictor of decreased primary patency in women but not in men.\nWomen undergoing EIA angioplasty with stent placement have significantly reduced primary patency rates. Despite initial technical success, these patients are at increased risk of long-term failure and might require subsequent procedures to obtain clinical success. Conversely, men undergoing EIA stenting have a more favorable outcome than women.",

    "abstract": "Endoscopic saphenous vein harvest has been explored as a minimally invasive alternative to a long continuous leg incision for removal of the greater saphenous vein. The endoscopic technique uses limited incisions (2-4) with extended \"skin bridges\" and videoscopic equipment for the dissection and removal of the greater saphenous vein. This study was undertaken to evaluate the long-term durability of saphenous vein grafts harvested by an endoscopic technique and used for lower extremity arterial revascularization.\nAll patients who underwent endoscopic saphenous vein harvesting for lower extremity arterial bypass grafting were prospectively followed for graft patency and risk factors. Grafts were surveyed with serial duplex scans at 3- to 6-month intervals over this 5-year study. Life-table methods were used to assess graft survival. A computerized registry and medical records were reviewed to determine graft patency and patient survival.\nFrom September 1994 to August 2000, 164 lower extremity arterial saphenous vein grafts harvested by an endoscopic technique were used for lower extremity arterial bypass grafting in 150 patients. The patient population included 111 males (75%) and 112 smokers (75%), but also included a high-risk cohort of 65 diabetic patients (43%) and 15 patients undergoing dialysis/renal transplant (10%). Twenty-eight patients (19%) died within the study period. With life-table methods, 1-, 3-, and 5-year secondary patency rates were 85% (+/- 3.2%), 74% (+/- 5.7%), and 68% (+/- 11.6%). Of the 30 failed grafts, 7 (4%) failed in the first month related to inadequate runoff (4), cardiac instability (2), and an additional surgical procedure (1). Twenty-three grafts (14%) failed between 1 and 42 months. Twenty-two (16%) of these 134 patent grafts underwent a second procedure to maintain patency (13 as primary-assisted patency and 9 as secondary patency).\nEndoscopic saphenous vein harvest for lower extremity arterial reconstruction provides a satisfactory conduit for lower extremity bypass grafting. Although increased manipulation from this limited access technique may incite an injury response in the vein, these vein grafts can maintain an adequate patency for lower extremity bypass grafting.",

    "abstract": "The results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, atherectomy, and laser angioplasty for the treatment of long-segment (>10 cm) superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusive disease have proved disappointing. Remote superficial femoral artery endarterectomy (RSFAE) is a minimally invasive procedure, performed through a single limited groin incision that may offer patency rates comparable with those of above-knee femoropopliteal (AKFP) bypass graft. In this retrospective multicenter study the medium-term results of RSFAE are examined.\nSixty patients were included in this study. Indications for the procedure were claudication in 52 patients and limb salvage in eight patients. RSFAE was performed with the MollRing Cutter device through a femoral arteriotomy. The distal \"flap\" of atheroma was anchored by balloon/stent angioplasty through the femoral arteriotomy. All patients underwent a follow-up examination with serial color flow ultrasound scanning.\nTen patients with heavily calcified SFAs failed as \"intentions to treat\"; these patients underwent AKFP bypass grafting. The mean length of the endarterectomized SFAs was 22.3 cm (range, 8-37 cm). The primary cumulative patency rate by means of life-table analysis was 61.4% +/- 9% (SE), (mean, 12.9 months; range, 3-36 months). During follow-up, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was necessary in 14 patients, for a primary-assisted patency rate of 82.6% +/- 8%. The locations of the restenoses after RSFAE were evenly distributed along the endarterectomized SFAs. There were no deaths and one wound complication (hematoma), and the mean hospital length of stay was 1.4 days +/- 0.8 days.\nRSFAE is a safe and moderately durable procedure. If long-term patency rates are similar to those of AKFP bypass graft, RSFAE may prove to be a minimally invasive adjunct for the treatment of SFA occlusive disease that will lower operative morbidity, reduce hospital LOS, and shorten recuperation.",

    "abstract": "The expansion of aneurysms after endovascular repair is a consequence of persistent sac pressure, usually resulting from an endoleak. Several authors have suggested that sac expansion can occur even in the absence of endoleak, referring to this phenomenon as endotension. This study undertakes a review of the largest US endograft trial data to better define the significance of aneurysm expansion in the absence of endoleak.\nThe core laboratory imaging database from the Ancure (Guidant) endovascular graft Phase I and Phase II trials approved by the Food and Drug Administration was reviewed with attention to aneurysm size and endoleak. Aneurysm size was measured with standardized two-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scan at the area of largest initial aneurysm diameter. Endoleak was detected with CT scans, color duplex ultrasound scans, and angiography in selected cases. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and every 12 months thereafter. An endograft was classified as leaking if any endoleak was detected with any modality at any time point.\nA total of 658 patients were entered into these protocols and the data submitted to the core laboratory. A control group of 120 conventional aortic patients and a group of 62 without baseline CT data were excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining 476 patients, 144 (60 tube, 60 bifurcated, and 24 mono-iliac) were free of endoleak at all intervals and had baseline CT measurements to allow comparison. Overall, the average size decrease in this nonleaking group was 9.9 +/- 9.4 mm (range, -50.6-11.1 mm) at a mean follow-up of 23.3 months. Evaluation for overall aneurysm expansion revealed 17 patients who had an increase of 2.3 +/- 2.9 mm (range, 0.3-11.1 mm) at a mean follow-up of 14.1 months. Only two patients without evidence of endoleak exhibited growth of more than 5 mm at maximum follow-up (7.6 mm at 12 months and 11.1 mm at 36 months). Additional analysis of sealed endoleaks and late endoleaks failed to demonstrate any group with expansion in the absence of detectable endoleak.\nEndotension appears to be rare in this large series of prospectively evaluated endografts. From this review, endotension seems more likely to represent missed endoleak than true aneurysm expansion in the absence of perigraft flow.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the outcome of an individualized treatment algorithm for prosthetic graft infection, including the application of in situ graft replacement, based on clinical presentation, extent of graft infection, and microbiology.\nThere was a retrospective review (1991-2000) of 119 patients with 68 aortoiliofemoral or 51 extracavitary (infrainguinal, 19; axillofemoral, 16; femorofemoral, 16) prosthetic graft infections presenting more than 3 months (range, 3-136 months) after implantation/revision. The treatment algorithm consisted of graft excision with or without ex situ bypass grafts for patients presenting with sepsis or graft-enteric erosion, whereas in situ replacement (autogenous vein, rifampin-bonded polyester, polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]) was used in patients with less virulent gram-positive graft infection, in particular infections caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis. Outcomes (death, limb loss, recurrent infection) were correlated with treatment type and infecting organism.\nIn situ replacement was used in 52% of aortoiliofemoral (autogenous vein, 10; rifampin-bonded polyester, 6; PTFE, 9) and 80% of extracavitary (autogenous vein, 26; PTFE, 9; rifampin, 6) graft infections. Total graft excision with ex situ bypass was performed in 34 patients, including 21 patients with graft-enteric erosion/fistula, with a 21% operative mortality and 9% amputation rate. In situ graft replacement was used to treat 76 graft infections with a 30-day operative mortality rate of 4% and an amputation rate of 2%. Graft excision alone was performed in nine patients with one 30-day death. Gram-positive cocci were the prevalent infecting organisms of both intracavitary (59% of isolates) and extracavitary (76% of isolates) graft infections. S epidermidis was the infecting organism in 40% of patients, accounting for the expanded application of in situ prosthetic replacement using a rifampin-bonded polyester or PTFE prosthesis. During the mean follow-up interval of 26 months, recurrent graft infection developed in 3% (1 of 34) of patients after conventional treatment, 3% (1 of 36) patients after in situ vein replacement, and 10% (4 of 40) patients after in situ prosthetic graft replacement (P >.05). Failure of in situ replacement procedures was the result of virulent and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.\nIn situ replacement was a safe and durable option in most (64%) patients presenting with prosthetic graft infection. In situ replacement with a rifampin-bonded graft was effective for S epidermidis graft infection, but when the entire prosthesis is involved with either a biofilm or invasive perigraft infection, in situ autogenous vein replacement is preferred. Virulent graft infections presenting with sepsis, anastomotic dehiscence, or graft enteric fistula should continue to be treated with total graft excision, and if feasible, staged ex situ bypass graft.",

Total graft excision with ex situ bypass was performed in 34 patients, including 21 patients with graft-enteric erosion/fistula, with a 21% operative mortality and 9% amputation rate. In situ graft replacement was used to treat 76 graft infections with a 30-day operative mortality rate of 4% and an amputation rate of 2%. Graft excision alone was performed in nine patients with one 30-day death. Gram-positive cocci were the prevalent infecting organisms of both intracavitary (59% of isolates) and extracavitary (76% of isolates) graft infections. S epidermidis was the infecting organism in 40% of patients, accounting for the expanded application of in situ prosthetic replacement using a rifampin-bonded polyester or PTFE prosthesis. During the mean follow-up interval of 26 months, recurrent graft infection developed in 3% (1 of 34) of patients after conventional treatment, 3% (1 of 36) patients after in situ vein replacement, and 10% (4 of 40) patients after in situ prosthetic graft replacement (P >.05). Failure of in situ replacement procedures was the result of virulent and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.",

    "abstract": "Thoracoabdominal aortic replacement requires visceral vessel revascularization and is usually performed with Crawford's inclusion technique or a large Carrel patch. This segment of retained native aorta may be prone to recurrent aneurysmal disease. We reviewed our experience with patients in whom aneurysmal expansion of the visceral patch was detected.\nThe records of 107 patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic replacement operations performed or followed up at the Johns Hopkins Hospital between 1992 and 2000 were reviewed. All patients had visceral patches created for type II, III, or IV aneurysms. Visceral patches were considered aneurysmal if the maximal diameter of the aortic prosthesis and patch was 4.0 cm or more.\nPatch aneurysmal expansion (mean, 5.4 cm) was detected in eight patients (7.5%). All three women had connective tissue disorders (mean age, 36 years), and all five men had atherosclerotic disease (mean age, 73 years). Five patients were symptom free with their aneurysms detected by surveillance computed tomography scans; two patients had back pain prompting computed tomography scans; and one patient presented with an emergency patch rupture. Aneurysmal patches were successfully revised in three patients. Two patients died in the operating room, and three patch aneurysms (< 5 cm) are still being observed. The mean time to the detection of aneurysmal expansion was 6.5 years after the original operation. Therapy consisted of replacement of a segment of the thoracoabdominal aortic graft and refashioning a smaller patch, including only the visceral artery orifices with separate attachment of the left and possibly right renal artery.\nAlthough Crawford's inclusion method of visceral patch construction is generally durable, patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic replacement require yearly surveillance for the detection of aneurysmal expansion of the visceral patch. We recommend limiting visceral patch size at the original operation by routinely excluding the orifice of the left renal artery. Patients at high risk for recurrent aneurysmal expansion, such as those with connective tissue disorders, will benefit from creating small visceral patches and possibly implanting both renal arteries separately during the original operation.",

    "abstract": "The Southern Association for Vascular Surgery (SAVS) has played a significant role in the development and evolution of vascular surgery. This study was designed to document the contribution to the scientific literature and to highlight the important publications from the annual meetings of the SAVS on its 25th anniversary. A total of 413 (73%) of the 569 \"free papers\" presented at the SAVS Annual Meeting were published in journals that are identified in MEDLINE, and most (71%) were published in the Journal of Vascular Surgery. Carotid/cerebrovascular disease, leg ischemia, and basic considerations were the most common subject matters overall, although there has been a recent decrease in the percentage of articles about basic considerations and aortic aneurysms while there has been an increase in those about endovascular therapy, vascular laboratory/imaging, and visceral/renal artery disease. The 413 papers were cited a mean of 18 +/- 20 (+/- SD) times (range 0-143) with 32 papers cited more than 39 times and 17 papers cited more than 59 times. A panel of three reviewers identified 42 significant articles, among which 8 were considered seminal by 2 of the 3 reviewers. The papers presented at the annual meeting of the SAVS have made a significant contribution to the scientific literature in terms of both quantity and quality. These efforts have laid the foundation for the next quarter century and have raised the level of expectation.",

    "abstract": "Post-carotid endarterectomy, thrombosis, and intimal hyperplasia may be decreased by the inhibition of platelet adhesion and activation. In this study, a novel agent, saratin, was used to inhibit platelet-to-collagen adhesion in a rat carotid endarterectomy model. Saratin is a recombinant protein isolated from the saliva of the medicinal leech Hirudo medicinalis, which is thought to act by binding to collagen, and inhibits von Willebrand factor-collagen interaction under conditions of increased shear and therefore, the adherence and activation of platelets at the vessel wall. Saratin has the advantage of being a nonsystemic, site-specific topical application.\nA rat carotid endarterectomy model was used in which an open technique with arteriotomy and intimectomy was used. Saratin was applied to the endarterectomized surface of the carotid artery before arterial closure. End point measurements included platelet adhesion, thrombosis rate, intimal hyperplasia development, bleeding times, and platelet counts. Electron micrographs of carotid arteries were used for quantitative analysis of platelet aggregation and platelet counts. Intimal hyperplasia and thrombosis were assessed with computer-assisted morphometric analysis of elastin-stained carotid artery sections with direct measurement of the intimal hyperplasia area.\nThe topical application of saratin significantly decreased platelet adhesion compared with controls at 3 hours after carotid endarterectomy (64 +/- 17 vs 155 +/- 33 platelets per grid, P = .05), and 24 hours after carotid endarterectomy (35 +/- 11 vs 149 +/- 37 platelets per grid, P = .0110), respectively. A percent luminal stenosis, as a measure of intimal hyperplasia, was significantly decreased with saratin application compared with controls (10.9% +/- 1.8% vs 29.8% +/- 6.8%, P = .0042). This decrease in intimal hyperplasia formation correlated with the inhibition of platelet adhesion. Thirty-three percent of control arteries were found to be thrombosed 2 weeks after carotid endarterectomy compared with a 0% thrombosis rate in the saratin-treated group (P = .0156). No increased bleeding was encountered along the arterial suture line in the saratin group. Bleeding times and systemic platelet counts were not found to change significantly in the saratin-treated rats compared with control rats at 3 and 24 hours after endarterectomy.\nSaratin significantly decreased platelet adhesion, intimal hyperplasia, luminal stenosis, and thrombosis after carotid endarterectomy in rats. Saratin did not increase suture line bleeding or bleeding times, and did not decrease platelet counts. Saratin may serve as a topical agent to be used for the site-specific inhibition of thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia after vascular manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein J (ApoJ) is expressed during tissue injury and remodeling and has been implicated in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation. Recently, the gene for ApoJ was identified as upregulated in distal anastomotic intimal hyperplasia after prosthetic arterial grafting. In this study we investigate the effect of ApoJ on VSMC migration, adhesion, proliferation, and gene expression.\nTo study the effect of ApoJ on cell migration, we used a microchemotaxis chamber with an intervening 8-microm pore semipermeable polycarbonate membrane. Assays were performed with ApoJ alone (1-50 microg/mL) or in combination with platelet-derived growth factor homodimer bb (PDGF-bb; 10 ng/mL) or 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS; n = 8) in the lower wells. The influence of extracellular matrix interactions on ApoJ and chemotaxis was studied in a similar way, except membranes were collagen coated. Furthermore, cells were exposed to ApoJ 15 minutes before or after seeding on the coated membrane (n = 10). The influence of ApoJ on cell adhesion to collagen was assessed with cell exposure to ApoJ 15 minutes before or after seeding on a collagen-coated membrane (n = 10). Migration and adhesion were quantified by counting the number of cells per three independent high-power fields with light microscopy. The effect of ApoJ in 0.4% FBS with or without PDGF-bb on VSMC proliferation (n = 12) was assessed by means of [Methyl-(3)H] thymidine incorporation. The transcriptional profile of VSMCs in 2% FBS exposed to ApoJ and a control for 24 hours was analyzed with an oligonucleotide microarray containing 12,560 genes.\nApoJ alone was not chemotactic for VSMCs. Without collagen, ApoJ decreased the migration of VSMCs toward 2% FBS by 96% or more starting at 10 microg/mL (P < .05) and toward PDGF-bb by 60.9% or more starting at 25 microg/mL (P < .05) compared with the control. When collagen was introduced, ApoJ (25 microg/mL) decreased migration toward 2% FBS by 64% (P < .01) and toward PDGF-bb by 67.5% (P < .01) and decreased adhesion by 26.8% (P < .01) only when VSMCs in solution were exposed to ApoJ before placement on collagen. ApoJ did not induce VSMC proliferation. ApoJ alone decreased VSMC thymidine incorporation by 41.1% at 25 microg/mL (P < .05). ApoJ decreased thymidine incorporation of PDGF-bb stimulated VSMCs by 42.8% at 50 microg/mL (P < .05). Interleukin-8 and endothelin-1 were demonstrated by means of the microarray to be differentially expressed more than twofold in VSMCs that were exposed to ApoJ.\nApoJ is a potent inhibitor of VSMC migration, adhesion, and proliferation. Its genetic targets are linked to cell senescence and differentiation. Therefore, ApoJ may play a role, in part, in modulating the VSMC response to injury.",

    "abstract": "Intimal hyperplasia is one of the main responses of the vascular wall to injury. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that endoluminal seeding of host syngeneic vascular cells could limit intimal hyperplasia induced by either mechanical deendothelialization or chronic allograft rejection in rat aorta.\nAn experimental model of in situ seeding of syngeneic endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and fibroblasts (FIBs) was used in mechanically deendothelialized and allografted aortas. In a preliminary study, the ability of the three cell types (n = 5 per group) to seed on the deendothelialized luminal surface of the aortic wall was evaluated after 2 days, with the use of fluorescent PKH as marker. In the first model, the abdominal aorta of Lewis rats was deendothelialized (n = 6) or deendothelialized and seeded with either SMCs (n = 6) or FIBs (n = 6) before flow was restored. In the allograft model, aortas were harvested from dark agouti rats and orthotopically grafted in Lewis receivers, directly (n = 6) or after deendothelialization. Deendothelialization was performed alone (n = 6) or associated with the seeding of similar host (Lewis) syngeneic SMCs (n = 6) or FIBs (n = 6). Results were evaluated at 2 months with histologic and morphometric methods.\nSMCs and FIBs were able to adhere in situ to the deendothelialized aortic wall, whereas endothelial cells were not. In mechanically deendothelialized aortas, the seeding of syngeneic SMCs led to a significant reduction in intimal thickness compared with deendothelialized aortas or FIB-seeded aortas (26.9 +/- 1.7 microm vs 55.5 +/- 1.7 and 56.7 +/- 1.7 microm, respectively), and a lower nuclear content (382.2 +/- 35.7 microm(2) vs 779.6 +/- 65.9 and 529.6 +/- 24.3 microm(2), respectively) of neointima. After SMC seeding, intimal hyperplasia was richer in elastin, whereas after FIB seeding it was richer in collagen. In allografts, the seeding of syngeneic SMC led to a significant reduction in intimal thickness compared with control aortas, deendothelialized aortas, or FIB-seeded aortas (31.6 +/- 1.1 microm vs 88.55 +/- 2.8, 74.6 +/- 2.9, and 85.7 +/- 2.6 microm, respectively), and a reduced nuclear content of the neointima (444.9 +/- 23.4 microm(2) vs 1529.1 +/- 116, 972.3 +/- 50, and 645.2 +/- 32.4 microm(2), respectively). Differences observed in the extracellular matrix composition were equivalent to those observed in the mechanically deendothelialized model.\nOur results suggest that endoluminal seeding of syngeneic SMCs can be effective in reducing intimal hyperplasia both in a deendothelialization model and in arterial allografts. SMC and FIB endoluminal seeding led to a significatively different accumulation of extracellular matrix in the intima.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a distal arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) on the morphologic changes occurring in arterial bypass grafts by the use of a novel experimental model.\nAortofemoral bypass grafts with or without dAVFs were constructed in 36 Sprague-Dawley rats with a microsurgical technique. The bypass graft material consisted of deendothelialized autogenous tail artery (length, 25 mm; inside diameter, 0.5 mm). In 18 rats, dAVFs were constructed at the distal anastomosis. After 6 weeks, flow rates and shear stress were determined, and grafts were then harvested. Luminal, intimal, and medial cross-sectional areas were measured with computer imaging. Desmin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and von Willebrand factor (vWF) were identified with immunohistochemistry. Endothelialization was evaluated with SEM.\nAll bypass grafts remained patent at the time of graft harvest. Grafts with dAVFs showed increased flow rates (11.5 +/- 0.6 mL/min) compared with grafts without dAVFs (2.1 +/- 0.3 mL/min; P < .01). Shear stress was also increased in the dAVF group (340.9 +/- 23.4 dyne/cm(2) vs 113.7 +/- 12.5 dyne/cm(2); P < .01), with a corresponding suppression of intimal hyperplasia (0.059 +/- 0.011 mm(2) for dAVF grafts vs 0.225 +/- 0.009 mm(2) for non-dAVF grafts; P < .01). Staining for vWF was found in both the reendothelialized flow surface and the neointimal extracellular matrix. Remodeling of the grafts was characterized by a 50% increased luminal area, 70% decreased intimal area, and a 25% decreased medial area when a dAVF was constructed.\nA small animal experimental model of an arterial bypass graft can enable the evaluation of a variety of factors that influence graft patency. Increased blood flow velocity and shear stress induced by a dAVF are associated with a decrease in intimal and medial areas, which may reflect changes in cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, or matrix deposition. Deposition of vWF was also found both in the endothelium and throughout the hyperplastic intima. These findings suggest that the hemodynamic and morphologic changes associated with dAVF may potentiate graft patency and function.",

    "conclusions": "A small animal experimental model of an arterial bypass graft can enable the evaluation of a variety of factors that influence graft patency. Increased blood flow velocity and shear stress induced by a dAVF are associated with a decrease in intimal and medial areas, which may reflect changes in cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, or matrix deposition. Deposition of vWF was also found both in the endothelium and throughout the hyperplastic intima. These findings suggest that the hemodynamic and morphologic changes associated with dAVF may potentiate graft patency and function.",

Grafts with dAVFs showed increased flow rates (11.5 +/- 0.6 mL/min) compared with grafts without dAVFs (2.1 +/- 0.3 mL/min; P < .01). Shear stress was also increased in the dAVF group (340.9 +/- 23.4 dyne/cm(2) vs 113.7 +/- 12.5 dyne/cm(2); P < .01), with a corresponding suppression of intimal hyperplasia (0.059 +/- 0.011 mm(2) for dAVF grafts vs 0.225 +/- 0.009 mm(2) for non-dAVF grafts; P < .01). Staining for vWF was found in both the reendothelialized flow surface and the neointimal extracellular matrix. Remodeling of the grafts was characterized by a 50% increased luminal area, 70% decreased intimal area, and a 25% decreased medial area when a dAVF was constructed.",

    "abstract": "The study's aim was to evaluate access patency and incidence of revisions in patients initiating hemodialysis and to determine differences in access performance by type of access among patient subgroups.\nThe study used data from the United States Renal Data System Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Study Wave 2, which contained a random sample of dialysis patients initiating dialysis in 1996 and early 1997. Failures and revisions were evaluated among 2247 newly placed hemodialysis accesses by using Cox proportional hazards regression model and Poisson regression. Primary and secondary patency rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.\nFifteen hundred seventy-four prosthetic grafts, 492 simple autogenous fistulas, and 181 venous transposition fistulas were available for evaluation. Prosthetic grafts had a 41% greater risk of primary failure compared with simple fistulas (relative risk, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.22-1.64; P < .001) and a 91% higher incidence of revision (relative risk, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.60-2.28; P <.001). At 2 years, autogenous fistulas demonstrated superior primary patency (39.8% versus 24.6%, P < .001) and equivalent secondary patency (64.3% versus 59.5%, P = .24) compared with prosthetic grafts. When compared with simple fistulas, vein transpositions demonstrated equivalent secondary patency at 2 years (61.5% versus 64.3%, P = .43) but inferior primary patency (27.7% versus 39.8%, P = .008) and had a 32% increased incidence of revision (P = .04). Autogenous fistulas had superior primary patency compared with prosthetic grafts in all patient subgroups except for patients with previously failed access. Vein transpositions showed the greatest benefit in terms of patency and incidence of revision in women and in patients with previously failed access.\nThe preferential placement of autogenous fistulas may increase primary patency and decrease the incidence of revisions. Vein transpositions had similar secondary patency compared with simple fistulas, but required more revisions. The greatest benefit of a vein transposition fistula was seen in women and in patients with a history of access failure.",

    "abstract": "The safety and efficacy of percutaneous transluminal intervention for renal artery stenosis is improving. This study evaluates the immediate and long-term anatomic and functional outcomes of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in a Veterans Affairs population.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of records from patients who underwent renal artery angioplasty with or without stenting at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System between January 1990 and June 1999. Indications for intervention included hypertension (78%) and rising serum creatinine (78%). Seventy-six patients (74 men, average age of 67 years, range 42-83 years) underwent 88 attempted interventions. Seventy-two percent of contralateral kidneys had significant disease (47% had a >60% stenosis; 16% were nonfunctioning or absent).\nOf the 88 planned interventions, 86 were successfully performed with placement of 46 stents (52%). Technical success (defined by <30% residual stenosis) was achieved in 78 vessels (89%). The procedure-related complication rate was 5%. Patient mortality by life table analysis was 49% at 5 years. Assisted primary patency rate at 5 years was 100%. Primary and secondary restenosis rates were 37% +/- 8% and 31% +/- 8% at 5 years, respectively. Sixty-eight percent of patients treated for hypertension demonstrated clinical benefit (improved or cured hypertension). This clinical benefit was maintained in 52% of the patients at 5 years, as measured by life table analysis. Serum creatinine was lowered or maintained in 88% of the patients, but this clinical benefit was only maintained in 25% of patients at 5 years.\nTransluminal intervention for clinically symptomatic atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is technically successful and safe. There are excellent assisted-patency and low restenosis rates. There is immediate clinical benefit for most patients, as evidenced by improved control of hypertension and preservation of renal function. However, within 5 years the benefit is not maintained for either hypertension (50%) or renal function (20%). Therefore, although technically successful, functional outcomes after endoluminal intervention are not maintained in the long term.",

    "abstract": "Mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) and its clinical spectrum have become better defined following improvements in diagnostic imaging. Historically, MVT has been described as a morbid clinical entity, but this may not necessarily be true. Often, an underlying disease process that predisposes a patient to MVT can be found and potentially treated. This study was designed to evaluate the diagnostics and management of MVT and to review long-term results of treatment.\nThirty-one patients in whom MVT was diagnosed between 1985 and 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. Survivors were contacted for follow-up. There were 15 men and 16 women. Ages ranged from 22 to 80 years (mean, 49.1 years). Thirteen patients had documented hypercoagulability, 10 had a history of previous abdominal surgery, 6 had a prior thrombotic episode, and 4 had a history of cancer. MVT presented as abdominal pain (84%), diarrhea (42%), and nausea/vomiting (32%). Computed tomography (CT) was considered diagnostic in 18 (90%) of 20 patients who underwent the test. CT diagnosed MVT in 15 (100%) of 15 patients presenting with vague abdominal pain or diarrhea. Angiography demonstrated MVT in only five (55.5%) of nine patients.\nSeven of 31 patients died within 30 days (< 30-day mortality rate, 23%). Twenty-two patients (72%) were initially treated with heparin. Nine patients were not heparinized: four of them died, and two were later given warfarin sodium (Coumadin). Of the 31 patients, only one received lytic therapy. Three patients became symptom free without anticoagulation. Ten patients (32%) underwent bowel resection. Overall, 19 (79%) of 24 survivors were treated with long-term warfarin therapy. Long-term follow-up was obtained in 24 patients (mean, 57.7 months). Twenty-one (88%) of 24 survived in follow-up.\nThe diagnosis of MVT should be suspected when acute abdominal symptoms develop in patients with prior thrombotic episodes or a documented coagulopathy. CT scanning appears to be the primary diagnostic test of choice. Anticoagulation is recommended. If diagnosed and treated early, MVT is not likely to progress to gangrenous bowel. Recent mortality rates for MVT are lower than previously published, perhaps because of earlier diagnosis and aggressive treatment or possibly because we now readily diagnose a more benign form of the disease, which is due to widespread use of CT scanning.",

    "abstract": "Initial treatment in the management of acute mesenteric vein thrombosis (MVT) is controversial. Some authors have proposed a surgical approach, whereas others have advocated medical therapy (anticoagulation). In this study, we analyzed and compared the results obtained with surgical and medical treatment to determine the best initial management for this disease.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the records of patients treated for MVT in a secondary care surgical department from January 1987 to December 1999. Before January 1995, our departmental policy was to perform surgery in patients with suspected MVT. Since January 1995, we have preferred a medical approach when achievable. Each patient in this study was assessed for diagnosis, initial management (laparotomy or anticoagulation), morbidity, mortality, duration of hospitalization, the need for secondary operation, portal hypertension, and survival rates.\nTwenty-six patients were treated, 14 before January 1995 (group 1) and 12 since January 1995 (group 2). Morbidity, mortality, secondary operation, portal hypertension, and 2-year survival rates were 34.6%, 19.2%, 15.3%, 19.2%, and 76.9%, respectively. No statistical difference was observed between the two groups. The mean duration of hospitalization was 51.6 days in group 1 and 23.2 days in group 2 (P < .05). Among the 12 patients treated by means of laparotomy with bowel resection, 10 patients (83%) had mucosal necrosis without transmural necrosis at pathologic study.\nNonoperative management for acute MVT is feasible when the initial diagnosis with a computed tomography scan is certain and when the bowel infarction has not led to transmural necrosis and bowel perforation. The morbidity, mortality, and survival rates are similar in cases of surgical and nonoperative management. The length of hospital stay is shorter when patients are treated with a nonoperative approach. A nonoperative approach, when indicated, avoids the resection of macroscopically infarcted small bowel (without transmural necrosis) in cases that are potentially reversible with anticoagulation alone.",

    "abstract": "Lower extremity arterial reconstructions with in situ greater saphenous vein (GSV) are an important component of limb salvage surgery. Initially, the procedure was performed through continuous skin incisions for side branch occlusion and valve lysis with a wound complication rate of 5% to 25%. To decrease these complications, we used endoscopic GSV harvest equipment in 25 in situ vein bypass grafts in 25 patients performed over 24 months.\nThe procedures were performed with three skin incisions: two for arterial access and a 2-cm incision above the knee to insert the Endopath device (Ethicon) to locate and clip the GSV side branches. After completion of the proximal anastomosis, the valves were lysed through the distal end of the vein with a flexible valvulotome. Completion cineangiography was performed to confirm side branch occlusion and evaluate the entire reconstruction. The results of this technique were compared with our last 25 in situ bypass grafts done with standard long incisions.\nIn the endoscopic group there was one (4%) minor wound complication (cellulitis). No postoperative arteriovenous fistulas were detected by means of duplex examination, and the average hospital stay was 6.2 +/- 1 days. One graft closed at 9 months as a result of distal vein hyperplasia, but the other grafts have remained patent, with follow-up from 6 to 30 months (mean, 18 months). Patients with the standard in situ bypass grafts had significantly (P < .05) more wound complications (20%) and longer average hospital stay (9.2 +/- 2 days) than the endoscopic group. Patency rates were comparable for both groups.\nThese results show that less invasive endoscopic in situ bypass grafting minimizes wound complications and reduces the need for hospitalization without decreasing patency or increasing operative time.",

    "abstract": "Until April 1997 we routinely performed intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (iaDSA) in all patients with severe lower leg ischemia requiring intervention. After a comparative study of duplex scanning (DS), pulsegenerated runoff, and iaDSA of the lower leg arteries, we postulated that management could be based on DS/pulse-generated runoff in 59% of patients. We prospectively evaluated the safety of such a noninvasive workup strategy.\nAll consecutive patients referred with severe lower leg ischemia between April 1997 and September 1998 were eligible. Management was based on DS with iaDSA being performed only on indication. Complications within 30 days and 12- and 24-month patency, survival, and limb salvage rates were recorded and compared with historical controls.\nA total of 125 limbs in 114 patients were evaluated (74% rest pain or tissue loss). In 97 (78%) of 125 limbs, management was based on DS. It comprised conservative treatment (n = 33, 0% after iaDSA), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (n = 25, 16% iaDSA), femoropopliteal bypass graft (n = 29, 17% iaDSA), femorotibial bypass graft (n = 29, 62% iaDSA), and other surgical procedures (n = 8, 4% iaDSA). Overall, the mortality within 30 days was 4% (5/114), and 2-year survival was 83%. Two-year primary and secondary patency and limb salvage rates were 75%, 93%, and 93% after a femoropopliteal bypass operation, respectively. One-year primary and secondary patency and limb salvage rates were 35%, 73%, and 74%, respectively, after a femorocrural bypass operation. There were no differences in patient characteristics, indication for specific treatment, and immediate and intermediate term outcome between the study and reference population.\nIn a vascular unit with wide expertise in DS of the lower leg arteries, management of patients with severe lower leg ischemia can be based on DS in most patients without negative effects on clinical outcome within 30 days and at 2-years' follow-up.",

    "abstract": "The development of the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and recurrence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) are not yet fully understood. The aim of the study was to identify factors that lead to the long-term complications of DVT.\nIn a 2-year prospective follow-up study, duplex scanning and strain-gauge plethysmography were used to evaluate DVT in relation to the development of long-term complications. Each of the 12 segments examined was assigned as a thrombosis score (TS). A total TS was calculated for each leg. Patent segments were assigned a TS = 0, noncompressible vein segments with flow TS = 1 and noncompressible vein segments without flow TS = 2. The degree of resolution of DVT and the incidence, timing, and outcome of further thrombotic events were measured during 24 months of follow-up.\nThe study involved 86 legs with DVT. The 2-year follow-up was completed for 70 legs. Within 3 months, only 1% of the originally occluded proximal deep vein segments were still occluded. Between all time intervals, from month 12 to month 24, for example, thrombus regression continued in 36% of the legs and thrombus propagation continued in 27%. Multiple regression analysis revealed that an increase in age (P = .008) and proximal location of the original DVT (P = .05) was significantly related to thrombus propagation. Multiple regression analysis showed that the risk factors for clinical signs of PTS were a high venous outflow resistance after 1-month and 12-month follow-ups (P <or= .002) and a high thrombosis score in the proximal veins after 3 months (P = .008).\nIn the follow-up of older patients and patients with proximal DVT, evolution was shown to be an unstable process with continuing propagation for 2 years. The risk factors for the development of PTS were a slow decrease in venous outflow resistance or a high thrombosis score of the proximal veins after 3 months.",

Study subjects included a sample of 259 reference patients without VV (CEAP class 0 or 1) and 1054 patients with VV who were classified as having VV alone (367; 34.8%), VV with edema (125; 11.9%), VV with skin changes (431; 40.9%), VV with healed ulcer (100; 9.5%), and VV with active ulcer (31; 2.9%). The main outcome measure was generic and disease-specific QOL, as measured by means of the Short-Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36) and the VEINES-QOL scale, and patient-reported symptoms as measured by the VEINES-SYM scale.\nIn patients with VV, age-standardized mean SF-36 physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) scores were 45.6 and 46.1 in men and 44.2 and 43.2 in women, respectively, compared with population norms of 50. PCS scores decreased according to increasing severity of concomitant venous disease, with the lowest mean scores of 37.3 and 35.5 found in patients with VV and active ulcer. However, adjusted analyses showed no statistically significant differences between patients with VV alone and patients without VV for PCS (0.0), MCS (1.0), VEINES-QOL (-0.1), or VEINES-SYM (0.0) scores. In comparison with patients without VV, the largest differences were seen in patients with VV and edema (PCS, VEINES-QOL, and VEINES-SYM score differences of -1.8, -2.5, and -2.9, respectively) and in patients with VV and ulceration (differences of -3.3, -3.4, and -2.7, respectively). The high prevalence of major symptoms of venous disorders in patients in CEAP class 0 or 1 being treated for venous disorders (76.1% of patients had heaviness, aching legs, or swelling) might have contributed to the impairment of QOL in the reference group.\nResults indicate that impairment in physical QOL in patients with VV is associated with concomitant venous disease, rather than the presence of VV per se.

    "abstract": "Racial variation in health care outcomes is an important topic. Risk-adjustment models have not been developed for elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (AAA), lower extremity bypass revascularization (LEB), or lower extremity amputation (AMP). Earlier studies examining racial variation in mortality and morbidity from AAA, LEB, or AMP were limited to administrative data. This study determined risk factors for mortality after surgery for vascular disease and determined whether race is an important risk factor.\nData in this prospective observational study were obtained from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Detailed demographic and clinical data were collected prospectively from patients' medical records by trained nurse reviewers. Eligible patients were those 18 years and older who underwent elective AAA, LEB, or AMP at one of 44 VA medical centers performing both vascular and cardiac surgery (phase I; October 1991 to December 1993) and at one of these 44 or 79 additional VA medical centers performing vascular but not cardiac surgery (phase II; January 1994 to August 1995). The independent association of several preoperative factors with the 30-day postoperative mortality rate was examined with stepwise logistic regression analysis for AAA, LEB, and AMP. Models were developed in the combined 44 VA medical centers and validated in the 79 VA medical centers. The independent association of race with the 30-day postoperative mortality rate was examined after controlling for important preoperative risk factors for each operation.\nMore than 10,000 surgical operations were examined, and 5, 3, and 10 independent preoperative predictors of 30-day mortality rate were identified for AAA, LEB, and AMP, respectively. The observed mortality rate for patients undergoing AAA was higher (7.2% vs 3.2%; P =.02) in African American patients than in white patients in the 44 VA medical centers, although the differences were not significant in LEB and AMP or at the additional 79 hospitals. After important preoperative risk factors were controlled, there was no difference in 30-day mortality rates between African American patients and white patients.\nWe identified several important preoperative risk factors for 30-day mortality rate in three vascular operations. From the results of this study, race was determined not to be an independent predictor of mortality.",

    "abstract": "Blunt aortic injury (BAI) involving the thoracic aorta is usually described as occurring at the isthmus. We hypothesized that injuries 1 cm or less from the inferior border of the left subclavian artery (LSCA) are associated with an increased mortality rate compared with injuries that are more distal.\nA retrospective review of patients admitted with the diagnosis of BAI was performed. Injuries were divided into two groups: group I, injuries that were 1 cm or less from the junction of the LSCA and the thoracic aorta; group II, injuries that were more than 1 cm from the LSCA. Primary outcome measures included cross-clamp time, rupture, and death.\nIn a 14-year period, 122 patients were admitted with BAI. The anatomy relative to the LSCA could be determined in 91 patients who underwent operative repair. Forty-two injuries (46%) were classified as group I, and 49 injuries were classified as group II. Group I injuries were characterized by an increased mortality rate (18/42 or 43% in group I vs 11/49 or 22% in group II, P = .04), intraoperative rupture rate (7/42 or 17% in group I vs 1/49 or 2% in group II, P = .003), and cross-clamp time (39.5 +/- 21.9 minutes in group I vs 28.4 +/- 13 minutes in group II, P = .04). Three ruptures occurred while proximal control was being obtained.\nIncreased technical difficulty and risk of rupture characterize injuries that occur proximally in the descending thoracic aorta, 1 cm from the LSCA. These injuries may be better managed by instituting bypass before attempting to obtain proximal control and by routinely clamping proximal to the LSCA.",

    "abstract": "Paraplegia remains a frequent complication of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. Many adjunct therapies have been developed to address this complication. Lumbar drainage is frequently used in an attempt to decrease intrathecal pressure and improve intramedullary perfusion pressure. The effectiveness of this therapy is unclear, and the complications of lumbar drainage used for this indication are unknown. We present a case of intraspinal hematoma with significant neurologic deficit after TAAA repair and review the associated complications of lumbar drains placed for TAAA.\nThe charts of all patients undergoing operations for TAAA repair were reviewed. Patients who underwent perioperative placement of a lumbar drain were included regardless of aneurysm type or etiology. Demographics, Crawford grade, and perioperative parameters and complications were reviewed.\nSixty-five patients underwent TAAA repair with 62 (95%) receiving a preoperative lumbar drain. There were two (3.2%) intraspinal hemorrhagic complications, including one patient with a poor neurologic outcome. No infections or other complications directly related to drainage were identified. Multivariate logistic regression analysis failed to demonstrate a significant association between lumbar drain complications and perioperative and intraoperative parameters such as blood loss or hypotension, level of drain placement, and Crawford grade.\nLumbar drainage is a frequent adjunct to TAAA repair. However, placement of the drain itself can be associated with significant complications whose aggravating factors may be unidentifiable. Complications resulting from lumbar drainage should be considered in any patient who has postoperative lower extremity neurologic deficits.",

Arterial allografts were harvested from multiple organ donors and cryopreserved at -80 degrees C without rate-controlled freezing. The patients were observed for survival, limb salvage, persistence and/or recurrence of infection, and allograft patency. The results were calculated with life-table methods.\nDuring the 8-year study period, 28 consecutive patients (27 men, 1 woman; mean age, 64 years) underwent treatment for abdominal aortic infection (23 graft infections, including 7 graft-enteric fistulas and 5 primary aortic infections). Allograft reconstruction was performed as an emergency procedure in 13 patients (46%). The mean follow-up period was 35.4 months (range, 6-101 months). The overall treatment-related mortality rate was 17.8% (17% for graft infection, 20% for primary aortic infection). The overall 3-year survival was 67%. There was no early or late amputation. There was no persistent or recurrent infection, and none of the patients received long-term (> 3 months) antibiotic therapy. Reoperation for allograft revision, excision, or replacement was necessary in four patients (17%) who were available for examination, with no reoperative perioperative death. The 3-year primary and secondary allograft patency rates were 81% and 96%, respectively.\nOur experience with cryopreserved arterial allograft in the management of abdominal aortic infection suggests that this technique seems to be a useful option for treating one of the most dreaded vascular complications.",

One hundred twelve cases were scanned annually for 1 to 5 years (mean, 2.5 years) and referred for surgery if the AAA exceeded 5 cm in diameter. A random sample of 70 of the 112 cases had P-plasmin-antiplasmin-complexes (PAPs), P-plasminogen, and S-elastin-peptides (SEPs).\nPAP was positively correlated with annual expansion rate (r = 0.39, 0.16-0.56), persisting after adjustment for initial AAA size, SEP, age, and smoking. However, PAP levels did not correlate with the initial AAA size or SEP. Furthermore, PAP levels were significantly predictive for cases expanding to operation-recommendable AAA sizes. Combined with the initial AAA size, both optimal sensitivity and specificity were 82%, increasing to 95% and 96%, respectively, excluding those lost to follow-up and accepting 2 mm of interobserver variation.\nThe progression of AAA is correlated with the PAP level, which seems to have a predictive value similar to the best serologic predictor known, serum-elastin-peptides.",

    "abstract": "Eradication of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection and inhibition of elastolytic matrix metalloproteinases with doxycycline have been suggested to reduce the growth rates of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). We designed a study to investigate the efficacy of doxycycline in reducing the expansion of small AAAs.\nThis was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study that was set in a university referral hospital. The study group consisted of 32 of 34 initially eligible patients who had an AAA diameter perpendicular to the aortic axis of 30 mm or more in size or a ratio of infrarenal to suprarenal aortic diameter of 1.2 or more and a diameter less than 55 mm. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either doxycycline (150 mg daily) or placebo during a 3-month period and underwent ultrasound surveillance during an 18-month period. Outcome measures included aneurysm expansion rates, the number of patients who had AAA rupture or repair, C pneumoniae antibody titers, and serum concentrations of C-reactive protein.\nThe aneurysm expansion rate in the doxycycline group was significantly lower than that in the placebo group during the 6- to 12-month (P = .01) and the 12- to 18-month periods (P =.01). Five patients (41%) in the placebo group and 1 patient (7%) in the doxycycline group had an overall expansion of the aneurysm of 5 mm or more during the 18-month follow-up. Among the placebo group patients, a higher expansion rate was observed in those with enhanced C pneumoniae immunoglobulin G antibody titers (> 128) than in those with lower titers (P = .03). Doxycycline treatment had no clear effect on antibody titers. However, at 6-month follow-up, C-reactive protein levels in the doxycycline group were significantly lower than the baseline levels (P = .01).\nThe results of this small pilot study suggest that doxycycline may favorably alter the outcome of patients with small AAA. However, because of the small size of this randomized study and of the potentially confounding effect of pretreatment risk factors, doxycycline-based treatment cannot be justified only on the ground of the current results. Because of the high prevalence of this disorder and its clinical, social, and economic relevance, a multicenter study should be performed to further investigate whether there is any place for medical treatment of small AAAs.",

After superselective catheterization of the feeding vessel, with 3F microcatheters, and liberal injections of vasodilators, embolization was performed with either a mixture of biologic glue and Lipiodol (n = 16) or Microcoils (n = 2).\nThe procedure was performed through the femoral artery in 16 patients and through the brachial artery in the remaining two patients. Overall, superselective catheterization and embolization were successfully undertaken in 17 (94.4%) of 18 patients. In the remaining patient, superselective catheterization proved impossible. This patient was treated with an injection of microparticles completed by means of embolization of biologic glue more proximally in an iliolumbar branch. During follow-up (mean, 13.3 months) after embolization, the aneurysm sac shrank in 13 (72.2%) of 18 patients. A new type II endoleak was diagnosed on helical computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in two (11.1%) of 18 patients.\nPercutaneous embolization is a safe and effective technique for treatment of type II endoleaks.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of aortoiliac tortuosity, as assessed by observers and 3-dimensional (3D) computer-based methods, on the conduct and outcome of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms.\nInfrarenal aortoiliac tortuosity was measured in 75 patients (mean follow-up, 14.8 +/- 10.4 months) who underwent endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms by using the following four methods: (1) grading by 2 experienced observers; (2) tortuosity index measured as the inverse radius of curvature (cm(-1)) at 1-mm intervals along the median luminal centerline (MLC) on 3D reconstructions of computed tomography (CT) angiograms and was calculated as the sum of values greater than 0.3 cm(-1); (3) MLC-straight line length ratio from renal to hypogastric arteries; (4) manual measurement of angles at points of angulation on anteroposterior and lateral projections of 3D CT reconstructions. In evaluating association between these measures, correlation between human observers was accepted as the gold standard.\nFor rating of overall aortoiliac tortuosity, interobserver correlation (r = 0.67) was comparable with correlation of observers with tortuosity index (r = 0.67 and 0.56), whereas correlations of each observer with MLC-straight line ratio (r = 0.50 and 0.56) and cumulative angulation (r = 0.44 and 0.44) were significant but weaker. For determining the relative tortuosity of right and left aortoiliac access, agreement between observers and tortuosity index (54% and 58%; P < .05; kappa, 0.33 and 0.38) was not as good as between observers (68%; P < .001; kappa, 0.53). This difference was primarily related to evaluation of the aorta, where interobserver correlation (r = 0.71) was better than that between each observer and tortuosity index (r = 0.47 and 0.55), whereas correlations in the iliac arteries were comparable (r = 0.64 and 0.67) (all coefficients P < .01). Increased tortuosity was associated with a more complex endovascular repair, as reflected by longer fluoroscopy time (P = .05), use of more contrast material (P = .03), use of extender modules (P = .04), and more frequent use of arterial reconstruction (P = .01), but was not associated with a higher overall complication rate. Increased tortuosity, when it occurred in the aortic neck, was associated with predischarge endoleak (P = .03) but not with late endoleak, intervention, or aneurysm-related adverse events.\nAortoiliac tortuosity is associated with increased complexity of endovascular aneurysm repair and with predischarge endoleak but does not appear to affect intermediate-term results. Computer-based 3D measurement of aortoiliac tortuosity is feasible and clinically meaningful. Its ultimate role in relation to human assessment must be further defined in future studies.",

Perfusion imaging studies were performed by bolus-tracking of a dosage of 0.2 mmol/kg body weight of gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid on a 1.5-T scanner using a T2*-weighted fast low-angle shot sequence. The observed signal intensities were converted pixel by pixel into concentration-time curves. In each patient, the hemispheres were compared and the difference between the normalized first moments (NFMs) and the percentage changes of the regional cerebral blood volume (CBV) were calculated. Three months postoperatively, perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 13 patients.\nIn patients with <80% stenosis (n = 10), there was no significant alteration of NFM and regional CBV compared with the contralateral hemisphere (-0.16 +/- 0.7 s, +5.9 +/- 24.6%). In patients with stenoses >or=80% (n = 16), we found an increase in NFM ipsilateral to the stenosis of 1.2 +/- 0.92 s (P < .001) and an increase of CBV of 16.8 +/- 15.2% (P < .005). Three months postoperatively, perfusion parameters were normal in all 13 patients examined.\nPerfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is well suited to evaluate the preoperative and postoperative hemodynamic changes in patients with carotid artery stenosis.

However, this selected patient cohort has been poorly studied.\nA retrospective review of patients who underwent CEA during a 2-year period at a tertiary referral institution was performed. Each patient was evaluated and categorized, according to the exclusion criteria, by NASCET and ACAS standards. Statistical analysis using chi(2) and Fisher exact tests was performed.\nThere were 366 CEAs performed on 348 patients, including 32 (8.7%) for recurrent stenosis.

    "abstract": "Carotid angioplasty and stenting procedures are associated with an obligatory release of particulate debris into the distal cerebral circulation. Although most of the emboli are small and do not result in symptomatic neurologic deficits, some may be large enough to cause stroke. For this reason, a variety of filters and balloon occlusion devices have been employed as adjuvants to decrease the risk of distal embolization during carotid stenting. Some of these devices rely on the arrest of antegrade blood flow with the use of inflow arrest. The present study was undertaken to investigate the hemodynamic conditions that exist at the carotid bifurcation during common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion.\nInternal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA) stump pressures were measured in 29 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Duplex ultrasound scanning was used to measure the direction and velocity of blood flow in the ICA and ECA with the CCA cross-clamped but the ICA and ECA open, a clinical scenario analogous to CCA balloon occlusion at the time of carotid angioplasty and stenting. The direction and magnitude of ICA and ECA flow were compared with the stump pressures to determine whether a correlation existed between these variables.\nThe mean stump pressure in the ICA and ECA averaged 56 +/- 16 and 53 +/- 12 mm Hg, respectively. The ICA systolic stump pressure was lower than the ECA systolic stump pressure in six patients (21%), and all of these patients had persistent antegrade systolic duplex blood flow by duplex interrogation during CCA occlusion. The ICA systolic stump pressure exceeded the ECA systolic stump pressure in 19 patients (66%), and all of these patients had retrograde ICA flow during systole. Diastolic flow was also well correlated with the magnitude of the ICA/ECA stump pressure differential, with antegrade diastolic ICA blood flow in all nine patients with an ICA diastolic stump pressure less than the ECA diastolic stump pressure. None of the 10 patients with ICA diastolic stump pressure greater than ICA diastolic stump pressure maintained antegrade ICA diastolic flow, but four of these patients had flow to zero in diastole. Overall, 13 of 29 patients (45%) could be surmised to be at risk for distal embolization to the brain based on the persistence of some element of either systolic or diastolic antegrade ICA flow during common carotid occlusion.\nCommon carotid occlusion alone appears insufficient to protect against distal embolization during manipulations of the carotid bifurcation. Persistent systolic or diastolic antegrade blood flow occurs in a high proportion of patients, lending credence to the use of additional protective strategies to ameliorate the risk of embolic complications.",

Overall, 13 of 29 patients (45%) could be surmised to be at risk for distal embolization to the brain based on the persistence of some element of either systolic or diastolic antegrade ICA flow during common carotid occlusion.",

    "abstract": "Surgery under controlled ischemia has been extensively practiced by cardiac, plastic, orthopedic, vascular, and general surgeons. During the past 20 years, we have routinely used this technique to operate on a clean, bloodless field in complex cases of congenital vascular malformations. Based on our favorable experience, we have extended the use of the pneumatic tourniquet to complex cases of primary varicose veins. The use of the tourniquet has dramatically decreased the blood loss and operating time in complex venous surgery without complications secondary to its use. This technique represents a welcome alternative to the bloody, tedious, and time-consuming traditional varicose vein surgery of the past. Complex venous surgery for extensive varicose veins of the extremities can be safely and expeditiously performed under controlled ischemia. It should be the technique of choice.",

    "abstract": "We report the case of a young white woman in whom cerebrovascular moyamoya disease, which was associated with nonarteriosclerotic peripheral artery disease of the subclavian, iliac, and femoropopliteal arteries, was diagnosed by means of angiography. During 8 years of follow-up, the peripheral artery disease progressed, without any signs characteristic of systemic inflammation or vasculitis, leading to severe calf and arm claudication. Despite the absence of histologic confirmation, this observation strongly suggests that peripheral artery involvement may be a feature of moyamoya disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an association of classical cerebrovascular moyamoya disease with peripheral artery disease.",

    "abstract": "Increased transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) activity is associated with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) disease progression and dermal skin pathology. Because TGF-beta(1) stimulates collagen synthesis and alters the levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs), we investigated the hypothesis that increased TGF-beta(1) activity is associated with differences in messenger RNA and protein levels of MMPs and TIMP-1 in patients with CVI.\nOne hundred ten biopsies of the lower calf and lower thigh in 73 patients were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stratified into six groups according to the clinical etiologic anatomic distribution pathophysiology disease classification. One set of lower-calf and lower-thigh biopsies were analyzed for MMP-1 and TIMP-1 gene expression with quantitative reverse transcription and competitive polymerase chain reaction. A second set of biopsies was analyzed for the active and latent forms of MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 as well as for TIMP-1 by western blotting, gelatin zymography, and tissue localization by immunohistochemistry (IHC).\nCompared with the control, MMP-1 messenger RNA was increased in class-4 and class-6 patients (P < or =.01), whereas TIMP-1 was increased in class-6 patients only (P < or =.05). However, there were no differences in total protein between MMP-1 and TIMP-1. Active MMP-2 protein increased in class-4 and class-5 patients compared with active MMP-1 and TIMP-1 (P < or =.01). Western blotting did not identify the active component of MMP-9. Similarly, only the latent form of MMP-9 was observed by gelatin zymography, whereas both the latent and active forms of MMP-2 were observed. IHC demonstrated MMP-1 and MMP-2 in dermal fibroblasts and in perivascular leukocytes. TIMP-1 was observed in basal-layer keratinocytes of the epidermis only. MMP-9 was not detected by IHC.\nMMP synthesis is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in CVI. Our data suggest that post-translational modifications are key to functional regulation. Dermal fibroblasts and migrating leukocytes are probable cellular sources of MMPs. Increased active MMP-2 levels in class-4 and class-5 patients indicate tissue remodeling caused by pre-ulcer and postulcer environmental stimuli. These data suggest that alterations in MMP-2 activity, in conjunction with TGF-beta(1)-mediated events, cause an imbalance in tissue remodeling leading to a pro-ulcer-forming environment.",

    "abstract": "Monocyte adhesion to the vessel wall is believed to be an important initiating event in atherosclerosis and intimal hyperplasia. We hypothesized that occult intraoperative vein injury induces an immediate increase in monocyte adhesion that may be critical to the development of vein graft disease.\nVein segments were obtained from patients (n = 23) undergoing lower extremity bypass. The initial segment (V1, n = 17) was excised immediately at the time of conduit harvest. A second segment (V2, n = 23) was obtained from the distal conduit just before performing the distal anastomosis. Segments were incubated with radiolabeled THP-1 cells (monocytoid cell line) for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, then rinsed and solubilized for determination of bound radioactivity. In a subset of grafts (n = 4), THP-1 cells were preincubated with monoclonal antibody (mAB) 7E3 (which binds to the monocyte integrin Mac-1 at its fibrinogen [Fg]-binding site) or control (mAB 14E11). Fg deposition and endothelial coverage were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (n = 10). Statistical analysis was performed using the paired t test and analysis of variance. Follow-up graft patency data were obtained and correlated with adhesion values using an exact test (StatXact, Cytel Software, Cambridge, Mass).\nMonocyte adhesion was significantly increased after surgical manipulation (V1, 2400 +/- 770 versus V2, 7343 +/- 1555 cells/cm(2); P <.02). Fg deposition was abundant in V2 sections and not seen in V1. Monocyte adhesion to V2 segments was significantly reduced (58% of control, P <.01) by 7E3 treatment. Graft follow-up was complete with a mean interval of 11 months. Higher V2 adhesion values were associated with occluded grafts (P =.07). The median value for the six occluded grafts was 6234 cells/cm(2) versus 3892 cells/cm(2) for the 17 patent grafts.\nMonocyte adhesion to the vein wall is immediately increased after surgical manipulation and is inhibited by mAB 7E3. Early monocyte adhesion to vein grafts is likely to involve interactions between Mac-1 and Fg. Heightened levels of monocyte adhesion at implantation may be a marker for subsequent vein graft failure.",

    "abstract": "A new intermittent pneumatic compression device (SCD Response System) has recently been shown in healthy volunteers to have the ability to detect the postcompression refilling of the calf veins and to respond by initiating the subsequent cycle when these veins are full. This has proven to be more effective in expelling blood proximally than the conventional intermittent pneumatic compression device (SCD Sequel System). The aim of this study was to test the influence of venous disease on the postcompression refill time detected by means of the SCD Response and the effectiveness of the new system in expelling blood in patients who have venous reflux caused by post-thrombotic syndrome or varicose veins.\nThis open, controlled trial was conducted in an academic vascular unit with 10 patients who had post-thrombotic syndrome and 10 patients who had varicose veins. The new SCD Response System was tested against the existing SCD Sequel System in both legs in the supine, semirecumbent, and sitting positions. The refilling time sensed by means of the device was correlated with the venous filling index by using air plethysmography. The total volume of blood expelled per hour during compression was compared with that expelled by the SCD Sequel System in the same volunteers and in the same positions.\nAn inverse association was found between the mean postcompression refilling time in the sitting position and the venous filling index of the apparently healthy or less severely affected leg (r = -0.52, P =.019), the refill time being significantly shorter in patients with advanced venous disease. The SCD Response System increased the volume expelled per hour in the post-thrombotic leg, when compared with the SCD Sequel System, by 109.9% (P =.005) in the supine position, by 85.1% (P =.009) in the semirecumbent position, and by 40.2% (P =.005) in the sitting position. The corresponding results in the more severely affected leg in patients with varicose veins were 71.9% (P =.005) in the supine position, 77.9% (P =.005) in the semirecumbent position, and 55.7% (P =.013) in the sitting position. Similar improved results were also found in the contralateral leg in both groups.\nThe deflation settings of the new SCD Response System are able to be adjusted selectively, correlating with the physiological severity of chronic venous insufficiency. By achieving more frequent compression cycles, the new system is more effective than the current one in expelling blood proximally, confirming our earlier findings in healthy volunteers. Further studies testing a possible improved efficacy in preventing deep venous thrombosis in this high-risk group are justified.",

    "abstract": "An endoleak results from the incomplete endovascular exclusion of an aneurysm. We developed an experimental model to analyze hemodynamic changes within the aneurysm sac in the presence of an endoleak, with and without a simulated open collateral branch.\nWith a latex aneurysm model connected to a pulsatile pump, pressures were measured simultaneously within the system (systemic pressure) and the aneurysm sac (intrasac pressure). The experiments were performed without endoleak (control group) and after creating a 3.5-mm (group 1), 4.5-mm (group 2), and 6-mm (group 3) diameter orifice in the endograft, simulating an endoleak. Pressures were also registered with and without a patent aneurysm side branch.\nIn each endoleak group, the intrasac diastolic pressure (DP) and mean pressure (MP) were significantly higher than the systemic DP and MP (P =.01, P =.006, and P =.001, respectively), although the pressure curve was damped. The presence of an open side branch significantly reduced the intrasac DP and MP.\nIn this model, intrasac pressures were significantly higher than systemic pressures in the presence of all endoleaks, even the smallest ones. Intrasac pressures higher than systemic pressure may pose a high risk for aneurysm rupture. Although patent side branches significantly reduce these pressures, the aggressive management of an endoleak should be pursued.",

    "abstract": "Infected aortic aneurysms are rare, difficult to treat, and associated with significant morbidity. The purpose of this study was to review the management and results of patients with infected aortic aneurysms and identify clinical variables associated with poor outcome.\nThe clinical data and early and late outcomes of 43 patients treated for infected aortic aneurysms during a 25-year period (1976-2000) were reviewed. Variables were correlated with risk of aneurysm-related death and vascular complications, defined as organ or limb ischemia, graft infection or occlusion, and anastomotic or recurrent aneurysm.\nInfected aneurysms were infrarenal in only 40% of cases. Seventy percent of patients were immunocompromised hosts. Ninety-three percent had symptoms, and 53% had ruptured aneurysms. Surgical treatment was in situ aortic grafting (35) and extra-anatomic bypass (6). Operative mortality was 21% (9/42). Early vascular complications included ischemic colitis (3), anastomotic disruption (1), peripheral embolism (1), paraplegia (1), and monoparesis (1). Late vascular complications included graft infection (2), recurrent aneurysm (2), limb ischemia (1), and limb occlusion (1). Mean follow-up was 4.3 years. Cumulative survival rates at 1 year and 5 years were 82% and 50%, respectively, significantly lower than survival rates for the general population (96% and 81%) and for the noninfected aortic aneurysm cohort (91% and 69%) at same intervals. Rate of survival free of late graft-related complications was 90% at 1 year and 5 years, similar to that reported for patients who had repair of noninfected abdominal aortic aneurysms (97% and 92%). Variables associated with increased risk of aneurysm-related death included extensive periaortic infection, female sex, Staphylococcus aureus infection, aneurysm rupture, and suprarenal aneurysm location (P <.05). For risk of vascular complications, extensive periaortic infection, female sex, leukocytosis, and hemodynamic instability were positively associated (P <.05).\nInfected aortic aneurysms have an aggressive presentation and a complicated early outcome. However, late outcome is surprisingly favorable, with no aneurysm-related deaths and a low graft-related complication rate, similar to standard aneurysm repair. In situ aortic grafting is a safe and durable option in most patients.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular repair of aortoiliac aneurysms may be limited by extension of the aneurysm to the iliac bifurcation, necessitating endpoint implantation in the external iliac artery. In such cases the circulation to the internal iliac artery is interrupted. Bilateral internal iliac artery occlusion during endovascular repair may be associated with significant morbidity, including gluteal claudication, erectile dysfunction, and ischemia of the sigmoid colon and perineum. We have employed internal iliac artery revascularization (IIR) to allow endograft implantation in the external iliac artery while preserving flow to the internal iliac artery in patients with aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation bilaterally.\nA total of 11 IIR procedures were performed in 10 patients undergoing endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (9 men, 1 woman; mean age, 74 years). IIR was accomplished via a retroinguinal incision in 9 cases and a retroperitoneal incision in 2 cases. Six-mm polyester grafts were used for external-to-internal iliac artery bypass in 10 cases and internal iliac artery transposition onto the external iliac artery was used in one case. Endovascular AAA repair was performed using a modular bifurcated device (Talent-LPS, Medtronics, Minneapolis, Minn) after IIR. Bypass graft patency was determined immediately after the surgery, at 1 month, and every 3 months thereafter, using duplex ultrasound scanning and computed-tomography angiography. Mean aneurysm diameters were as follows: AAA, 6.4 +/- 0.7 cm; ipsilateral common iliac, 3.7 +/- 1.0 cm; contralateral common iliac, 3.9 +/- 0.8 cm.\nSuccessful IIR and endovascular AAA repair were accomplished in all cases. No proximal, distal, or graft junction endoleaks occurred. Two patients demonstrated retrograde aneurysm side-branch endoleaks originating from the lumbar arteries. One thrombosed spontaneously within 3 months. One perioperative myocardial infarction occurred. Reduction in aneurysm size was documented in 5 aortic, 5 ipsilateral iliac, and 3 contralateral iliac aneurysms. Gluteal claudication, erectile dysfunction, colon and perineal ischemia, and mortality did not occur. All IIRs have remained patent during a follow-up period of 4 to 15 months (mean, 10.1 months).\nIIR may be used with good short-term to intermediate-term patency to prevent pelvic ischemia in patients whose aneurysm anatomy requires extension of the endograft into the external iliac artery. This may allow endovascular AAA repair to be performed in patients who might otherwise be at risk for developing complications associated with bilateral internal iliac artery occlusion.",

    "abstract": "Adequate proximal neck length is important for proper endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Placement of endografts in AAAs with relatively short proximal necks may require covering the origin of accessory renal arteries. Exclusion of these arteries carries the theoretical concern of regional renal ischemia associated with loss of parenchyma or worsening hypertension. We reviewed our experience with accessory renal exclusions during endovascular AAA repair to determine the frequency and severity of complications.\nComplete records were available for review on 311 of 325 consecutive patients treated with endovascular grafts for AAAs from February 6, 1996, to March 15, 2001. The presence of accessory renal arteries was ascertained from preoperative/intraoperative aortography or from computed tomographic scanning. Sizes of the accessories were measured by using the main renal arteries as a reference. Considerations for excluding the accessory renal arteries were based on the likelihood of successful proximal attachment to healthy aorta, an accessory vessel whose size does not exceed the diameter of the main renal artery, and the absence of renal disease.\nThe mean follow-up was 11.5 months. Fifty-two accessory renal arteries were documented in 37 patients (12%), ranging from 1 to > or =3 per patient. Of these, 26 accessory renal arteries were covered in 24 patients. Patients ranged in age from 57 to 85 years (mean, 74.1 years), with 20 men and 4 women. The Ancure device was used in 23 patients and the Excluder device in one. Of the accessories excluded, 22 originated above the aneurysm and 4 originated directly from the aneurysm itself. There were no perioperative mortalities. One patient died 5 months after surgery from an unrelated condition. There was one type I (distal) endoleak and no type II endoleaks. Five patients (21%) had segmental renal infarction associated with the side of accessory renal artery exclusion. Only one patient with segmental infarction had significant postoperative hypertension that resulted in changes in blood pressure medication. The blood pressure reverted to normal 3 months later. One patient with a stenotic left main renal artery required exclusion of the accessory renal artery for successful proximal attachment. Serum creatinine levels remained unchanged throughout follow-up in all but one patient, in whom progressive postoperative renal failure developed despite normal renal flow scan, presumably from intraoperative manipulation and contrast nephropathy.\nExclusion of accessory renal arteries to facilitate endovascular AAA repair appears to be well tolerated. Long-term sequelae seem infrequent and mild.",

Of these, 26 accessory renal arteries were covered in 24 patients. Patients ranged in age from 57 to 85 years (mean, 74.1 years), with 20 men and 4 women. The Ancure device was used in 23 patients and the Excluder device in one. Of the accessories excluded, 22 originated above the aneurysm and 4 originated directly from the aneurysm itself. There were no perioperative mortalities. One patient died 5 months after surgery from an unrelated condition. There was one type I (distal) endoleak and no type II endoleaks. Five patients (21%) had segmental renal infarction associated with the side of accessory renal artery exclusion. Only one patient with segmental infarction had significant postoperative hypertension that resulted in changes in blood pressure medication. The blood pressure reverted to normal 3 months later. One patient with a stenotic left main renal artery required exclusion of the accessory renal artery for successful proximal attachment. Serum creatinine levels remained unchanged throughout follow-up in all but one patient, in whom progressive postoperative renal failure developed despite normal renal flow scan, presumably from intraoperative manipulation and contrast nephropathy.",

    "abstract": "Information on nonsaphenous superficial venous reflux is lacking. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of reflux in nonsaphenous veins, their association and correlation with risk factors, and signs and symptoms of chronic venous disease (CVD).\nInformation on 835 limbs in patients with signs and symptoms of CVD were prospectively entered into a customized database. These patients had been referred from the venous clinic to the vascular laboratory for color-flow duplex scanning evaluation of the lower-limb veins. All patients were examined for reflux in the standing and sitting positions. Nonsaphenous reflux was defined as that in superficial veins that are not part of the greater or lesser saphenous systems. Particular attention was paid to the patterns of reflux and anatomy of the nonsaphenous veins from the proximal to the distal ends, including their connections with the saphenous and deep veins.\nNonsaphenous venous reflux was found in 84 limbs (10%) of 72 patients, 67 of whom were women. The mean number of pregnancies in these patients was higher than that of 100 randomly selected women with saphenous reflux (3.2 vs 2.2). According to CEAP classification, 90% of the limbs were in CVD classes 1 through 3 and only 10% had skin damage (classes 4-6). Symptoms were present in 67 limbs (80%). Forty-two limbs (50%) had reflux in tributaries of lateral, posterior, and medial thigh. These veins were connected with perforators uniting with the deep femoral, femoral, and muscular veins of the thigh in 36 limbs. Reflux in these perforators was detected in 19 limbs. Reflux arising from the pelvic veins was found in 29 limbs (34%), 18 of which were from vulvar veins medial to saphenofemoral junction and 11 of which were from veins in the gluteal area. Incompetent veins from the sciatic nerve were found in nine limbs (10%). Reflux in the vein of the popliteal fossa was found in seven limbs (8%). Reflux in knee tributaries was detected in three limbs (4%), two of which were connected with posterolateral knee perforators and one with the posterior tibial nerve veins.\nThe prevalence of nonsaphenous reflux in our practice was 10%. The vast majority of these patients (93%) were women with a mean of 3.2 pregnancies. Ninety percent of these limbs have signs and symptoms assigned to CVD classes 1 to 3. These data may simply reflect the referral pattern, but also a possible association with female sex and number of pregnancies. The unusual anatomy of these veins stresses the importance of color-flow duplex scanning before surgery.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of secondary procedures to facilitate maturation of autogenous arteriovenous (AV) fistulas and optimize their use for hemodialysis access.\nThe records of patients undergoing new autogenous AV fistulas were reviewed. Analyses of fistula maturation, subsequent interventions, access function, and patency were performed.\nFrom July 1998 through June 2000, 362 new AV access fistulas and grafts were constructed in 310 patients. In this cohort, 170 autogenous fistulas (55%) were placed in 163 patients. Fistula types included 115 antecubital brachiocephalic fistulas (Kaufmann) (68%), 47 radiocephalic fistulas (Brescia-Cimino) (28%), and 8 basilic vein transposition fistulas (4%). Secondary procedures were required in nine cases (5%) for failure to mature (4 Brescia-Cimino, 5 Kaufmann) and included 3 vein patches, 3 interposition vein grafts, 1 transposition to a more proximal artery, 1 branch ligation, and 1 balloon angioplasty of the subclavian artery; they occurred at 4.4 +/- 2.1 months (mean +/- SD). Additional procedures were needed to revise patent but failing fistulas in six cases (3.5%; 3 Brescia-Cimino, 3 Kaufmann) and included 5 transpositions to a more proximal artery and 1 vein patch; they occurred at 12.3 +/- 5.6 months (P =.002 compared with immature fistulas). For this series of autogenous fistulas, a functional access was achieved in 129 of 143 patients (90%) for whom follow-up was available. Twelve-month actuarial primary patency for autogenous fistulas was 78% compared with 49% for prosthetic grafts placed in the same period (P =.001, log-rank).\nIn the current series, a 10% improvement in accomplishing or maintaining a functional autogenous access was achieved through secondary procedures applied to autogenous fistulas that either fail to mature or develop functional deterioration. Aggressive assessment of immature or failing autogenous AV fistulas for correctable lesions should be included in any hemodialysis practice to optimize their use and exploit the superiority of the native fistula.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed our institutional experience with paradoxical embolus (PDE) during a recent 10-year period to define the clinical presentation, method of diagnosis, and results of treatment.\nA chart review of all patients with the discharge diagnosis of arterial embolus and venous thromboembolism or patent foramen ovale (PFO) and arterial embolus was conducted. Only patients with simultaneous deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolus, arterial embolus, and PFO were considered to have presumptive PDE. Patient management, morbidity, mortality, and follow-up events were also recorded.\nFrom October 1989 until November 1999, PDE accounted for 13 cases of acute arterial occlusion at our institution. There were seven men and six women (mean age, 57 +/- 11 years). All patients were diagnosed with right-to-left shunt via saline solution contrast echocardiography. Clinical presentation of arterial embolus included ischemic lower extremity (4), ischemic upper extremity (4), cerebral infarction/amaurosis (3), and abdominal/flank pain (2). Five patients also presented with concomitant respiratory distress. Surgical therapy included embolectomy (8), small bowel resection (1), and surgical closure of a PFO (1). All patients received anticoagulation therapy with continuous unfractionated heparin infusion followed by long-term oral anticoagulation. Five inferior vena caval filters were placed. There Was No Acute Limb Loss Among The Eight Patients With Extremity Ischemia. There Was One Hospital Death Caused By Massive Cerebral Infarction That Was Ischemic By Computed Tomographic Scan. Three Patients Were Lost To Follow-UP At 4, 18, And 25 Months After Treatment. Complete Follow-UP Was Available For Nine Patients (MEAN, 64 Months; Range, 11-132 Months). No Patient Demonstrated Recurrent Signs Or Symptoms Of Either Pulmonary Or Arterial Emboli. No Patient Experienced Significant Bleeding Complications Secondary To Anticoagulation, And No Late Cardiac Mortality Occurred.\nOur institutional experience with PDE suggests the following: (1) saline solution contrast echocardiography is a useful noninvasive method to demonstrate PFO with right-left shunt that permits presumptive antemortem diagnosis; (2) recommendations for treatment vary with the certainty of diagnosis and should be individualized; (3) paradoxical embolus may account for a significant minority of acute arterial occlusions in the absence of a clear cardiac or proximal arterial source.",

    "abstract": "The purposes of this study were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of limited-dose tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in patients with acute vascular occlusion and to compare these results with those obtained in equivalent patients receiving urokinase.\nWe compared the results of 60 patients receiving catheter-directed urokinase from November 1997 to November 1998 (240,000 units/h x 4 h, 120,000 units/h thereafter for a maximum of 48 h) with those of 45 patients receiving catheter-directed t-PA from November 1998 to August 2000 (2 mg/h, total dose < or =100 mg) for acute arterial occlusion (AAO) and acute venous occlusion (AVO). Interventional approaches such as cross-catheter and coaxial techniques were used to reduce the dose of lytic agent needed to achieve pre-lysis-treatment goals (eg, complete lysis of all thrombus/unmasking graft stenosis or establishing outflow target). Statistical analysis was performed using Student t test and Fisher exact test.\nThe urokinase and t-PA groups were comparable with regard to age, comorbidities (coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, renal insufficiency, smoking), duration of ischemic or occlusive symptoms, location of occlusive process, pretreatment with warfarin, and thrombotic versus embolic and native versus graft occlusion in patients with AAO. In patients with AAO and in those with AVO, t-PA was equivalent to or better than urokinase with regard to percent of clot lysis, incidence of major bleeding complications, limb salvage, and mortality. Achievement of pretreatment goals (arterial patients only) was 50% for urokinase patients and 76% for t-PA patients (P =.02). Analysis of success in individual pretreatment-goal achievement showed urokinase and t-PA to be equivalent in unmasking stenoses (85% and 84%, respectively; P = NS), whereas t-PA was superior to urokinase in the more critical task of establishing run-off (39% versus 81% for urokinase and t-PA, respectively; P =.001). Additional interventions, either endovascular or surgical, were required in 60% and 51% (P = NS) of patients receiving urokinase and t-PA, respectively, for AAO, and in 54% and 62% (P = NS) of patients receiving urokinase and t-PA, respectively, for AVO.\nLimited-dose t-PA is a safe and effective therapy for AAO and AVO when administered by experienced teams using innovative but well-established interventional techniques.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of Medicare coverage limitations and claim denials on noninvasive vascular diagnostic testing.\nAll Medicare claims for noninvasive vascular diagnostic studies from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 1999, were identified from the hospital billing database according to Current Procedural Terminology codes for carotid artery duplex ultrasound scan, venous duplex ultrasound scan, and lower-extremity arterial Doppler scan. Reasons for Medicare denial of payment for these tests were reviewed and a cost analysis was performed.\nDuring the 1-year period, there were 1096 noninvasive vascular diagnostic studies performed on Medicare patients. Of these 1096 tests, 176 (16.1%) were denied by Medicare (19.6% of 408 carotid duplex ultrasound scans, 16.8% of 345 venous duplex ultrasound scans, and 11.1% of 343 lower-extremity arterial Doppler scans). Of the noninvasive vascular tests denied by Medicare, an abnormal result was present in 72.5% of carotid duplex ultrasound scans, 32.8% of venous duplex ultrasound scans, and 78.9% of lower-extremity arterial Doppler scans. Overall, 88.1% of all initially denied claims (N = 176) were ultimately reimbursed by Medicare after resubmission, including 77.1% of the 118 claims denied based on compliance rules for \"medical necessity.\"\nBecause of coverage limitations, Medicare denials of noninvasive vascular diagnostic tests can lead to potential uncompensated physician and hospital technical fees if denied claims are unrecognized. Vascular laboratories performing these tests need to review compliance with Medicare guidelines. Improvements may need to be made at both the provider and Medicare carrier levels in obtaining reimbursement for appropriately ordered noninvasive vascular diagnostic studies.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of postoperative hypertension (HTN) after eversion carotid endarterectomy (e-CEA) was compared with that after standard carotid endarterectomy (s-CEA).\nIn a retrospective analysis from January 1998 to January 2000, 217 patients underwent 219 CEAs for symptomatic (68) or asymptomatic (151) high-grade (>80%) carotid artery stenosis by either standard (137) or eversion (82) techniques. The eversion technique involves an oblique transection of the internal carotid artery at the carotid bulb and a subsequent endarterectomy by everting the internal carotid artery over the atheromatous plaque. All procedures were done under general anesthesia, and somatosensory-evoked potentials were used for cerebral monitoring. Patients with s-CEA were compared with those with e-CEA for postoperative hemodynamic instability, carotid sinus nerve block, requirement for intravenous vasodilators or vasopressors, stroke, and death.\nPatients who underwent e-CEA had a significantly (P <.005) increased postoperative blood pressure and required more frequent intravenous antihypertensive medication (24%), compared with patients having an s-CEA (6%). Furthermore, postoperative vasopressors were required after 10% of s-CEAs, but after none of the e-CEAs. No statistically significant difference was noted in the morbidity or mortality of patients after s-CEA and e-CEA.\ne-CEA is a substantial risk factor for HTN in the immediate postoperative period, when compared with the s-CEA. This difference would be even more remarkable in the absence of antihypertensive medications in the e-CEA group and vasopressors in the s-CEA group. Therefore, particular attention should be focused on diagnosing and controlling postoperative HTN in patients after e-CEA.",

Patients were followed at regular intervals with duplex ultrasound scanning. The outcome of the stented group (Group II) was divided into early experience (Group IIA, first 12 cases) and late experience (Group IIB, last 13 cases) for learning curve consideration, and each was compared with the reoperation group. A Kaplan-Meier life table analysis was used to estimate the stroke-free survival rates and freedom from > or =50% recurrent restenosis for both groups.\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics and indications for intervention were similar for both groups. The mean time from the original CEA to reoperation was 41 months in Group I versus 43 months in Group II. Overall, stenting had higher 30-day stroke rates than reoperations-16% (3 major and 1 minor stroke) versus 3.4% (1 out of 2 [1.7%] was a major stroke, P <.05). However, Group IIB had similar major stroke rates to Group I (0% versus 1.7%). Cranial nerve injury was noted in 10 patients (17%) in Group I (only 1 [1.7%] was permanent) versus 0% in Group II (P <.05). Recurrent > or =50% restenosis was higher in Group II than in Group I (24% versus 0%, P <.001). Stroke-free survival rates at 6 months and 1, 2, and 3 years for Group I were 97%, 97%, 94%, and 82%, respectively, versus 79%, 79%, 79%, and 79%, respectively, for Group II (P =.059). Freedom from recurrent > or =50% restenosis rates at 6 months and 1, 2, and 3 years were 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, for Group I versus 100%, 94%, 65%, and 44%, respectively, for Group II (P <.0001).\nCarotid PTA/stenting has a similar 30-day stroke rate to that of reoperation for RCS once experience is established. However, PTA/stenting has a higher incidence of restenosis than reoperation, which is associated with a percentage of cranial nerve injuries. Therefore, PTA/stenting can be an alternative to reoperation, particularly in marginal surgical risk patients.",

    "abstract": "The long-term results of Greenfield inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement have been well documented in adults; however, similar data do not exist for pediatric patients. The potential for growth and the increased life expectancy in younger patients may contribute to a difference in the natural history of filters placed in children. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of pediatric patients with IVC filters.\nAt the University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center, medical records and radiographs of patients 18 years old or younger at the time of IVC filter placement were reviewed. Follow-up data were obtained by interview, physical examination, and venous duplex ultrasound scanning.\nA total of 15 IVC filters were placed in children 18 years old or younger between 1983 and 1999. In 10 patients the indications for IVC filter placement were lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism. In five patients, prophylactic filters were placed in the absence of DVT because of a high risk for the development of pulmonary embolism. Surgical exposure of the right internal jugular vein was used to place the first eight filters. The remainder were inserted percutaneously through the right internal jugular vein or the right common femoral vein. There were no complications or mortality related to filter insertion. Follow-up of the surviving 14 patients ranged from 19 months to 16 years. During long-term follow-up, no patient had a pulmonary embolus. Of the nine patients who had lower-extremity DVT, three developed mild common femoral venous reflux documented by duplex scan. Of the five patients who had prophylactic filters, four had no symptoms or duplex evidence of reflux. The other patient, who was paraplegic, had bilateral leg edema but no venous varicosities and no reflux on duplex scan 11 years after filter placement. No patient in either group had chronic venous obstruction.\nIn long-term follow-up there were no instances of pulmonary embolism, IVC thrombosis, significant postphlebitic symptoms, or significant filter migration among 14 pediatric patients with Greenfield IVC filters. This suggests a safety profile and efficacy similar to that seen in adults.",

    "abstract": "Symptoms of pelvic venous congestion (chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, dysuria, and dysmenorrhea) have been attributed to massive gonadal reflux. However, obstruction of the gonadal outflow may produce similar symptoms. Mesoaortic compression of the left renal vein (nutcracker syndrome) produces both obstruction and reflux, resulting in symptoms of pelvic congestion. We describe the diagnosis and management of nine patients studied in our institutions.\nFrom a group of 51 female patients with pelvic congestion symptoms studied at our institutions, there were nine patients with symptoms of pelvic congestion, microscopic hematuria, and left-sided flank pain. The diagnosis of the nutcracker syndrome was suspected based on clinical examination, Doppler scan, duplex ultrasound scan, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnosis was confirmed by retrograde cine-video-angiography with renocaval gradient determination and catheterization of both internal iliac venous systems. All patients had a renocaval pressure gradient >4 mm Hg (normal, 0-1 mm Hg). Renal compression was relieved by external stent (ES) in two patients, internal stent (IS) in one patient, and gonadocaval bypass (GCB) in three. GCB was preceded by coil embolization of internal iliac vein tributaries connecting with lower-extremity varicose veins in three patients. Three patients deferred surgery and are under observation. Mean follow-up time was 36 months (range, 12-72 months).\nHematuria disappeared postoperatively in all patients. ES and IS normalized the renocaval gradient and resulted in significant alleviation of symptoms (90% improvement on a scale of 0-10 where 0 = no improvement and 10 = greatest improvement). Two patients with GCB had a residual gradient of 3 mm Hg. The third patient normalized the gradient. In this group, improvement of symptoms was 60%. Patients awaiting surgery are being treated conservatively (elastic stockings, hormones, and pelvic compression). They have shown only moderate improvement.\nThe nutcracker syndrome should be considered in women with symptoms of pelvic venous congestion and hematuria. The diagnosis is suspected by compression of the left renal vein on magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scan and confirmed by retrograde cine-video-angiography with determination of the renocaval gradient. Internal and external renal stenting as well as gonadocaval bypass are effective methods of treatment of the nutcracker syndrome. IS and ES were accompanied by better results than GCB. Surgical and radiologic interventional methods should be guided by the clinical, radiologic, and hemodynamic findings.",

    "abstract": "The use of intermittent pneumatic compression, in addition to elastic bandages or stockings, accelerates the healing of leg ulcers in patients with severe chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). There is recent evidence that impulse compression of the plantar venous plexus reduces post-traumatic ankle swelling and prevents postoperative venous thromboembolism. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and hemodynamic responses after home use of impulse foot compression for 3 months in patients already using therapeutic compression stockings for the management of CVI.\nTwelve extremities from 9 patients with documented CVI, class 4 to 5 according to the Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, Pathophysiology classification system, were included in this prospective cohort study. All patients were instructed to use a foot pump device at home for 2 hours a day for 3 months in addition to therapeutic compression stockings (30-40 mm Hg) worn during the day. The device was set to three cycles (3 seconds) of compression (120 mm Hg) per minute. A clinical scoring system was completed before foot compression and 1, 2, and 3 months thereafter. In addition, all patients underwent air plethysmography studies at the same time intervals, including venous volume, venous filling index, ejection fraction, and residual volume fraction.\nPatients reported significant improvement in their scores for swelling (P <.05) and pain (P <.04). Air plethysmography showed a reduction in venous volume and venous filling index, although these differences were not significant. Ejection fraction remained unchanged and residual volume fraction was significantly reduced (P <.05) compared with baseline. The foot compression devices were well tolerated by all the patients in the study.\nThe use of home foot impulse compression plus elastic stockings significantly reduced the residual volume fraction as measured by air-plethysmography in a group of patients with severe CVI. This favorable hemodynamic response could, in part, explain the clinical improvement achieved by this combined treatment. However, this represents a preliminary pilot study that needs to be confirmed in future randomized controlled studies with more patients included.",

    "abstract": "Duplex ultrasound scanning (US) is the accepted standard means of diagnosis for lower-extremity suprageniculate deep venous thrombosis (LE-DVT). Computed tomographic venography (CTV) has been proposed as an alternative modality for diagnosis of LE-DVT in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). This study compared CTV with US as a means of diagnosing acute LE-DVT.\nA retrospective review of US and CTV scans from 136 patients with suspected PE who underwent both studies to exclude acute LE-DVT at a single institution was performed. Studies were reviewed and coded in a blinded manner. US was considered to be the reference test. Direct costs of each study were determined by using commercial software.\nThe sensitivity and specificity rates of CTV were 71% and 93%, respectively. The positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy rates of CTV were 53%, 97%, and 90%, respectively. DVT localization was the same in eight of 10 cases in which the results of both US and CTV were positive. CTV costs and charges per study were greater than those of US by $46.88 and $602.00, respectively.\nCTV is specific, but has a lower sensitivity rate and positive predictive value for the diagnosis of acute LE-DVT compared with US. Additionally, CTV is more costly than US scanning. Because of the lower sensitivity rate and positive predictive value and the increased cost of CTV, US remains the screening study of choice in cases of suspected acute LE-DVT.",

    "abstract": "Primary chylous disorders (PCDs) are rare. Rupture of dilated lymph vessels (lymphangiectasia) may result in chylous ascites, chylothorax, or leakage of chyle through chylocutanous fistulas in the lower limbs or genitalia. Chyle may reflux through incompetent lymphatics, causing lymphedema. To assess the efficacy of surgical treatment, we reviewed our experience.\nThe clinical data of 35 patients with PCDs treated between January 1, 1976, and August 31, 2000, were reviewed retrospectively.\nFifteen men and 20 women (mean age, 29 years; range, 1 day-81 years) presented with PCDs. Sixteen (46%) patients had chylous ascites, and 19 (54%) had chylothorax (20 patients), and of these, 10 (29%) had both. In 16 patients, reflux of chyle into the pelvic or lower limb lymphatics caused lymphedema (14, 88%) or lymphatic leak through cutaneous fistulae (11, 69%). Presenting symptoms included lower-limb edema (19, 54%), dyspnea (17, 49%), scrotal or labial edema (15, 43%), or abdominal distention (13, 37%). Primary lymphangiectasia presented alone in 23 patients (66%), and it was associated with clinical syndromes or additional pathologic findings in 12 (yellow nail syndrome in 4, lymphangiomyomatosis in 3, unknown in 3, Prasad syndrome (hypogammaglobulinemia, lymphadenopathy, and pulmonary insufficiency) in 1, and thoracic duct cyst in 1). Twenty-one (60%) patients underwent 26 surgical procedures. Preoperative imaging included computed tomography scan in 15 patients, magnetic resonance imaging in 3, lymphoscintigraphy in 12, and lymphangiography in 14. Fifteen patients underwent 18 procedures for chylous ascites or pelvic reflux. Ten (56%) procedures were resection of retroperitoneal/mesenteric lymphatics with or without sclerotherapy of lymphatics, 4 (22%) were lymphovenous anastomoses or grafts, 3 (17%) were peritoneovenous shunts, and 1 (6%) patient had a hysterectomy. Six patients underwent eight procedures for chylothorax, including thoracotomy with decortication and pleurodesis (4 procedures), thoracoscopic decortication (1 patient), ligation of thoracic duct (2 procedures), and resection of thoracic duct cyst (1 patient). Postoperative mean follow-up was 54 months (range, 0.3-276). Early complications included wound infections in 3 patients, elevated liver enzymes in 1, and peritoneovenous shunt occlusion with innominate vein occlusion in 1. All patients improved initially, but four (19%) had recurrence of symptoms at a mean of 25 months (range, 1-43). Three patients had postoperative lymphoscintigraphy confirming improved lymphatic transport and diminished reflux. One patient died 12 years postoperatively, from causes unrelated to PCD.\nMore than half of the patients with PCDs require surgical treatment, and surgery should be considered in patients with significant symptoms of PCD. Lymphangiography is recommended to determine anatomy and the site of the lymphatic leak, especially if lymphovenous grafting is planned. All patients had initial benefit postoperatively and two thirds of patients demonstrated durable clinical improvement after surgical treatment.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to report improvement or normalization of abnormal lymphoscintigraphy in swollen lower limbs after correction of associated venous stenosis by balloon dilatation and placement of venous stent of the iliac veins.\nTwenty-six patients with lower-limb swelling underwent balloon dilatation and placement of venous stent of the iliac veins for correction of venous stenosis. Technetium 99M-sulfur colloid lymphoscintigraphy was also abnormal (8 absent, 18 reduced) before stent placement in all 26 limbs, suggesting combined venous/lymphatic etiology for the limb swelling. Median age was 53 years. Male-to-female ratio was 1:8 and left-to-right ratio, 3:1. Fifteen patients had limb pain associated with the swelling. Severity of venous stenosis was generally underestimated by preoperative transfemoral venography as compared with intravascular ultrasound, (mean, 50% versus 77%); in five limbs (19%), transfemoral venography altogether failed to identify the venous lesion evident on intravascular ultrasound. The etiology of venous obstruction was post-thrombotic in nine limbs and nonthrombotic (web, stricture, or May-Thurner syndrome) in 17 limbs.\nPoststent lymphoscintigraphy completely normalized in 10 limbs, improved but remained abnormal in 9, and remained unchanged in 7. Clinical follow-up (mean, 1 year) showed improvement in swelling in 16 of 26 limbs (P <.022), with complete resolution of swelling in six; degree of pain also improved (P <.02), with total relief of pain in 9 of 15 patients. There was also significant improvement in all categories of a quality of life questionnaire.\nThese findings suggest that patients with a diagnosis of lymphedema made on the basis of lymphoscintigraphy alone and consigned to conservative therapy on that basis may benefit from additional venous investigations regardless of clinical presentation suggestive of lymphedema. This report supports the practice of aggressively searching for a venous basis of edema in these patients. Correction of the venous lesion may result in normalization or improvement of the lymphoscintigraphic abnormality and in any case may yield significant symptom relief, even in some limbs where the lymphoscintigraphic abnormality failed to improve after placement of venous stent.",

    "abstract": "The indications for surgical perforator interruption remain undefined. Previous work has demonstrated an association between clinical status and the number of incompetent perforating veins (IPVs). Other studies have demonstrated that correction of IPV physiology results from abolition of saphenous system reflux. The purpose of this study was to identify which, if any, patterns of venous reflux and obstruction are particularly associated with IPV.\nTwo hundred thirty patients and subjects (103 men, 127 women, 308 limbs) with varying grades of venous disease were examined both clinically and with duplex ultrasound scan. The odds ratios (ORs) for the presence of IPVs were calculated for different anatomical distributions of main-stem venous reflux and obstruction. The base group are those with no main-stem venous disease.\nThere were no significant associations between the proportions of limbs demonstrating IPVs and patient age or sex. The ORs for the presence of IPVs in association with other venous disease are as follows (age/sex adjusted): long saphenous vein reflux, OR = 1.86, range = 1.32-2.63; short saphenous vein reflux, OR = 1.36, range = 1.02-1.82; deep system venous reflux, OR = 1.61, range = 1.2-2.15; superficial system reflux, OR = 3.17, range = 1.87-5.4; and deep system obstruction, OR = 1.09, range = 0.51-2.33. The ORs for combinations of venous disorders were calculated. Combinations of disease produced higher odds for the presence of IPVs than those above, the highest being long saphenous vein, short saphenous vein, and deep reflux combined, OR = 6.85 (95% CI, 2.97-15.83; P =.0001).\nAlthough the presence of IPVs is associated with venous ulceration, the highest ORs for the presence of IPVs were found in patients with superficial disease alone or in combination with deep reflux. Many of these may be corrected by saphenous surgery alone.",

Shortly after the embolization procedure, colonic necrosis developed in the patient, manifested by peritonitis, which necessitated a partial colectomy. This case underscores the devastating complication of colonic ischemia as a result of catheter-directed embolization of the inferior mesenteric artery in the management of an endoleak.",

    "abstract": "The production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP9, by macrophages may be a critical factor in the rupture of unstable atherosclerotic plaques and aortic aneurysms. Therefore, we studied the role of matrix and soluble cytokines in the regulation of monocyte/macrophage expression of MMP9. Although freshly isolated monocytes synthesize little MMP9, cells cultured on tissue-culture plastic differentiate into macrophages and synthesize maximal amounts of MMP9. Differentiated macrophages cultured on plastic are unresponsive to further stimulation by interleukin 1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or platelet-derived growth factor BB. In contrast, monocytes cultured on polymerized collagen synthesize much less MMP9 than cells cultured on plastic and demonstrate a more than three-fold increase in MMP9 synthesis in response to interleukin 1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and platelet-derived growth factor BB. To determine whether the physical state of the collagen was critical for the decrease in basal synthesis of MMP9, monocytes were cultured in suspension for 5 days to allow differentiation and then seeded onto monomer or polymerized collagen. Synthesis of MMP9 was significantly decreased in cells on polymerized collagen and modestly increased in macrophages seeded on monomer collagen. These results suggest that MMP9 synthesis by macrophages in the vessel wall may be under negative control by native, polymerized collagen and that disruption of this native conformation could increase MMP9 production. In addition, cells in contact with the collagen matrix are potentially more responsive to soluble mediators such as platelet-derived growth factor, interleukin 1beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha.",

    "abstract": "We used (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a means of quantifying abnormalities in calf muscle oxygenation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) turnover in peripheral vascular disease (PVD).\nEleven male patients with PVD (mean age, 65 years; range, 55-76 years) and nine male control subjects of similar age were observed in a case-control study in vascular outpatients. Inclusion criteria were more than 6 months' calf claudication (median, 1.5 years; range, 0.6-18 years); proven femoropopliteal or iliofemoral occlusive or stenotic disease; maximum treadmill walking distance (2 km/h, 10 degrees gradient) of 50 to 230 m (mean, 112 m); ankle-brachial pressure index of 0.8 or less during exercise (mean, 0.47; range, 0.29-0.60). Exclusion criteria included diabetes mellitus, anemia, and magnet contraindications. Simultaneous (31)P MRS and NIRS of lateral gastrocnemius was conducted during 2 to 4 minutes of voluntary 0.5 Hz isometric plantarflexion at 50% and 75% maximum voluntary contraction force (MVC), followed by 5 minutes recovery. Each subject was studied three times, and the results were combined.\nCompared with control subjects, patients with PVD showed (1) normal muscle cross-sectional area, MVC, ATP turnover, and contractile efficiency (ATP turnover per force/area); (2) larger phosphocreatine (PCr) changes during exercise (ie, increased shortfall of oxidative ATP synthesis) and slower PCr recovery (47% +/- 7% [mean +/- SEM] decrease in functional capacity for oxidative ATP synthesis, P = .001); (3) faster deoxygenation during exercise and slower postexercise reoxygenation (59% +/- 7% decrease in rate constant, P = .0009), despite reduced oxidative ATP synthesis; (4) correlation between PCr and NIRS recovery rate constants (P < .02); and (5) correlations between smaller walking distance, slower PCr recovery, and reduced MVC (P < .001). The precision of the key measurements (rate constants and contractile efficiency) was 12% to 18% interstudy and 30% to 40% intersubject.\nThe primary lesion in oxygen supply dominates muscle metabolism. Reduced force-generation in patients who are affected more may protect muscle from metabolic stress.",

    "abstract": "The administration of angiogenic growth factors and the transfer of well-vascularized tissues have been shown to induce development of new blood vessels in ischemic muscle. The functional significance of these new vessels is unknown. The hypothesis of this study is that the transfer of vascularized muscle and the local infusion of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) synergistically improve contractile function of ischemic skeletal muscle.\nTwenty-six rabbits were divided into four groups. An ischemic hindlimb was created in each by ligating the right common iliac artery. The flap + bFGF group (n = 6) had transposition of a contralateral rectus muscle flap onto the thigh. Additionally, bFGF (3 ng/h) was continuously infused at the flap-thigh interface. In the flap group (n = 6), a similar muscle flap was created, but carrier solution was infused at the interface. In the bFGF group (n = 6), no muscle flap was created; instead, bFGF (3 ng/h) was infused into the external iliac artery of the ischemic limb. In the control group (n = 8), carrier solution was infused into the external iliac artery (no flap, no bFGF). After 1 week, the soleus muscle was isolated and stimulated. Maximum twitch tension, the fatigue index (force of contraction after 2 minutes of continuous stimulation/initial force of contraction), maximum recovery, and the number of limbs recovered (ie, limbs that achieve a force of contraction during the recovery period of > 75% of the force of the initial contraction at the start of continuous stimulation) were recorded. Blood vessel density (number of vessels per ***) was determined by immunostaining the soleus muscle with anti-alpha-actin antibody.\nAll values were indexed to the contralateral normal limb. The flap + bFGF group showed significant improvement versus the control group in maximum twitch tension (1.07 +/- 0.13 vs 0.63 +/- 0.12, P < .05), maximum recovery (0.94 +/- 0.05 vs 0.58 +/- 0.05, P < .05), and the number of limbs recovered (5/5 vs 0/6, P < .05). This improved function correlated with increased vessel density (flap + bFGF group, 1.44 +/- 0.11 vs control group, 0.72 +/- 0.01, P < .05).\nReperfusion of an ischemic limb with a well-vascularized muscle flap and local bFGF infusion promoted increased blood vessel density in distal ischemic muscle. This increased vascularity was associated with restoration of otherwise impaired muscle function. Improved function occurred rapidly (1 week). A transposed muscle flap provided a functional blood supply to the site of maximum ischemia; this could be used to salvage otherwise nonreconstructible ischemic limbs.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the accuracy of color-flow Doppler (CD) scanning, power Doppler (PD) scanning, and peak systolic Doppler frequency shift (PSF) in assessment of carotid artery stenosis with angiography used as gold standard, including the measurement techniques used in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (NASCET) and the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST).\nFifty-eight consecutive patients diagnosed for carotid artery surgery underwent color-coded duplex sonography and angiography. The duplex examination included the assessment of PSF and the videotaping of sagittal images in CD and PD mode from the proximal common carotid artery to the distal internal carotid artery. Two experienced examiners performed the studies, but once one examiner had done the taping, the other examiner was allowed only to review the tape. Separately, each examiner reviewed the tapes and determined by cursor settings each stenosis according to NASCET and ECST. For interobserver agreement kappa statistic was used. To compare with angiography (degree of stenosis 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80%) sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and overall accuracy were calculated. PSF cut-off frequencies were based on receiver operator curve analysis.\nBecause interobserver agreement in CD and PD was good (chance-corrected kappa > 0.6), further analysis used the between-observer mean value for each stenosis. With the NASCET measurement technique, accuracy of Doppler techniques to distinguish a 50% stenosis was 89% for PSF, 91% for CD, and 93% for PD; for a 70% stenosis it was 83% for PSF, 84% for CD, and 81% for PD. With the ECST measurement technique, accuracy to distinguish a 70% stenosis was 86% for PSF, 88% for CD, and 86% for PD; for an 80% stenosis it was 87% for PSF, 87% for CD, and 77% for PD.\nCD and PD carotid artery stenosis measurements are highly reproducible, and in our hands provided accuracy equal to PSF.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have reported an association between abdominal aortic dilatation and peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Narrowing of aortic diameter, also called abdominal aortic hypoplasia, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease have received insufficient attention. Precise estimates of the relationship between aortic hypoplasia and peripheral arterial occlusive disease are lacking. In this study, we assessed the relationship between abdominal aortic diameter and peripheral arterial occlusive disease.\nIn this cross-sectional study, we analyzed 1572 patients 18 to 79 years of age, newly referred to the vascular center of our hospital with clinically manifest atherosclerotic arterial disease or for treatment of cardiovascular risk factors. Diameter measurements were used to subdivide patients according to tertiles of abdominal aortic diameter. Peripheral arterial occlusive disease was assessed by adjusted Rose questionnaire, ankle-brachial pressure index, and the presence of gangrene or leg ulcers.\nCompared with patients with normal aortic diameter, peripheral arterial occlusive disease was twice as prevalent in patients at both ends of the aortic diameter spectrum. When the lowest tertile was compared with the middle tertile in male patients, the adjusted odds ratio was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.0-3.1). When the highest tertile was compared with the middle tertile, the adjusted odds ratio was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.2-3.4). Similar results were found in female patients. The adjusted odds ratio of lowest versus middle tertile was 2.4 (95% CI, 1.1-5.0) and 1.8 (95% CI, 0.8-4.0) when the highest tertile was compared with the middle tertile.\nThe risk of peripheral arterial occlusive disease was increased in the lower and upper distribution of aortic diameter. Apparently, both patients with an aortic diameter too large and patients with an aortic diameter too small are prone to peripheral arterial occlusive disease. This is the first large study that shows that small aortic diameter is associated with peripheral arterial occlusive disease.",

The CFA diameters in the patients with AAAs were 97.8% of those in healthy control subjects (P = not significant [NS]). After exclusion of the CFA aneurysms, the diameters were 92.7% of those in healthy control subjects (P = .0003).

Non-ischemic complications included femoral artery pseudoaneurysms (n = 4), arteriovenous fistulae (n = 5), uncontrollable bleeding, and expanding hematoma (n = 4). Operative repairs were performed successfully in all patients with non-ischemic iatrogenic femoral artery injuries. In contrast, ischemic complications occurred in 21 patients. Among them, 14 patients had acute femoral ischemia and underwent surgical interventions including femoral artery thrombectomy with primary closure (n = 6), saphenous vein patch angioplasty (n = 6), and resection with primary anastomosis (n = 2). Chronic femoral artery occlusion (> 30 days) occurred in seven patients, with symptoms including either severe claudication (n = 4) or gait disturbance or limb growth impairment (n = 3). Operative treatments in these patients included ileofemoral bypass grafting (n = 5), femorofemoral bypass grafting (n = 1), and femoral artery patch angioplasty (n = 1). During a mean follow-up period of 38 months, no instances of limb loss occurred, and 84% of children with ischemic complications eventually gained normal circulation. Factors that correlated with an increased risk of iatrogenic groin complications that necessitated surgical intervention included age younger than 3 years, therapeutic intervention, number of catheterizations (>or= 3), and use of 6F or larger guiding catheter.\nAlthough excellent operative results can be achieved in cases of non-ischemic complications, acute femoral occlusion in children younger than 2 years often leads to less satisfactory outcomes. Operative intervention can provide successful outcome in children with claudication caused by chronic limb ischemia.

Eligibility for home treatment has never been properly assessed.\nIn a 9-month period, we prospectively evaluated the possible reasons for hospital treatment in consecutive patients with acute DVT by using a check list that included medical reasons, home care situation, preferences, and hospital service logistics. Treatment consisted of low-molecular-weight heparin and concomitant oral vitamin K antagonists and compression therapy. A 3-month follow-up examination included assessment of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), bleeding events, and mortality.\nA total of 202 patients were included in the study; 117 patients (58%) were outpatients and 85 patients (42%) were hospitalized before DVT diagnosis. Of the 117 outpatients, 95 (81%) were considered eligible for home treatment. Only two patients (1.7%) were admitted to the hospital for DVT-related morbidity, one (0.85%) because of comorbidity, 11 (9.4%) for home care reasons, and eight (6.83%) because of hospital service logistics. Of the hospitalized patients, 79 (92.94%) remained inpatients, and six (7.05%) could be discharged within 48 hours. The only reason for hospitalization was pre-existing comorbidity. In outpatients, the outcome after 3 months showed a 4% rate of recurrent VTE, no major bleeding, and an 8% mortality rate; 75% of deaths were caused by cancer. No patient died of VTE. In inpatients, a statistically significant higher mortality rate was found (8% vs 19%; P < .02).\nLess than 3% of patients with DVT who were outpatients had to be hospitalized because of DVT morbidity. For the entire DVT population, the main reason for hospital treatment is comorbidity, rather than management issues or DVT morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Earlier studies have highlighted risk factors for perioperative stroke after carotid endarterectomy, such as female sex, preoperative symptoms, and cerebral infarction. In this study, we investigated the relationship between these factors and perioperative microembolization.\nA total of 235 patients were entered in the study at two centers. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound scanning was possible in 190 patients (81%) and was performed for 1 hour preoperatively and continuously intraoperatively as a means of detecting microemboli and monitoring mean middle cerebral artery velocity. The findings of transcranial Doppler ultrasound scanning were related to perioperative risk factors by means of univariate analysis.\nMicroemboli were detected in 28 (15%), 79 (42%), and 98 (52%) patients preoperatively, during carotid artery dissection, and after closure of the artery, respectively. Having 10 or more emboli after carotid artery closure was more common in women (P = .04) and in patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease (P = .04) and was demonstrated in three of the six patients who had a perioperative stroke. These three patients also had preoperative evidence of cerebral infarction and an intraoperative middle cerebral artery velocity less than 40 cm/s.\nIn this study, perioperative microembolization was more common in women and patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease. These findings may explain the increased risk of carotid surgery in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Aortoenteric fistula (AEF) is an uncommon but catastrophic complication that can occur either primarily or after aortic reconstruction. Untreated, it is uniformly fatal. Conventional surgical management is associated with a perioperative mortality rate of 25% to 90% and frequent major complications. We reviewed our experience with the endovascular treatment of both primary and secondary AEFs in an effort to determine whether endovascular repair is a less morbid alternative to traditional surgical treatment in select patients.\nIn a 5-year period, seven high-risk patients who had bleeding and an AEF documented by means of radiology or endoscopy (2 primary, 5 secondary) were treated with coil embolization (1) or placement of an endovascular aortic stent graft (3 aortouniiliac, 2 tube, 1 bifurcated). One patient underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous catheter drainage of an infected perigraft collection. The average follow-up period was 27 months (range, 11-66 months), and follow-up consisted of physical examination, complete blood count, and contrast-enhanced helical CT scanning at 3, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter. All patients were treated with intravenous antibiotics perioperatively and were prescribed life-long oral antibiotics on discharge.\nThere was one perioperative death (14%) caused by fungal sepsis. Persistent sepsis after stent-graft placement necessitated laparotomy and bowel resection in one patient. One patient had three bouts of recurrent sepsis that were successfully treated with a change of antibiotic. There were three late deaths (43%) unrelated to the procedure or AEF. Three patients (43%) were alive and well an average of 36 months (range, 23-67 months) after the procedure, with no clinical or radiologic evidence of recurrent bleeding or infection.\nEndovascular management of AEFs is technically feasible and may be the preferred treatment in select patients with bleeding and no signs of sepsis. In the setting of gross infection, it may also be considered in high-risk patients as a bridge to more definitive treatment after hemodynamic stabilization and optimization.",

    "abstract": "Wide-ranging predictions have been made about the usefulness of endovascular repair for patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). The availability of US Food and Drug Administration-approved devices has removed the restrictions on patient selection, which had been controlled by device trials. This study examined the applicability of endovascular AAA repair and identified the anatomic barriers to successful endovascular AAA repair that should guide future device development.\nAll patients who came to our institution for infrarenal AAA repair between April 1998 and June 2000 were offered evaluation for endovascular repair. Thin-cut spiral computed tomography scans and arteriograms were obtained on all patients, and their anatomic characteristics were prospectively entered into a database. A wide selection of available devices allowed the treatment of diverse AAA anatomic features.\nA total of 307 patients were examined (264 men, 43 women). Of these, 204 patients (66%; 185 men, 19 women) underwent endovascular repair, and 103 patients (34%, 79 men, 24 women) were rejected. Reasons for exclusion included short aneurysm neck (56, 54%), inadequate access because of small iliac arteries (48, 47%), wide aneurysm neck (41, 40%), presence of bilateral common iliac aneurysms extending to the hypogastric artery (22, 21%), excessive neck angulation (14, 14%), extensive mural thrombus in the aneurysm neck (10, 10%), extreme tortuosity of the iliac arteries (10, 10%), accessory renal arteries originating from the AAA (6, 6%), malignancy discovered during the examination (5, 5%), and death during the examination interval (2, 2%). Rejected patients had an average of 1.9 exclusion criteria (range, 1 to 4). A disproportionate number of women were excluded because of anatomic findings (P = .0009). Although 80% of patients who were at low risk for surgery qualified for endovascular repair, only 49% of our patients who were at high risk for surgery were acceptable candidates (P < .001). Of the 103 patients who were excluded, 34 (33%) underwent open surgical repair, and the remaining 69 (67%) were deemed to be unfit for open surgery. Three patients (1.4%) failed endograft placement because of inadequate vascular access.\nMost infrarenal AAAs (66%) can be treated with endovascular devices currently available commercially or through US Food and Drug Administration-approved clinical trials. However, patients who are at high risk for surgery and might benefit most from endovascular repair are less likely to qualify for the procedure (49%). Men (70%) are more likely than women (40%) to meet the anatomic criteria for endografting. Difficulties with vascular access and attachment site geometry predominate as reasons for exclusion. Our findings suggest that smaller profile devices, which can negotiate small and tortuous iliac arteries, are needed. Proximal and distal attachment site problems require devices that can accommodate wide and angulated attachment necks and achieve short seal zones.",

    "abstract": "We documented the postoperative complication rate and the late results of simultaneous infrarenal aortic replacement and renal artery (RA) revascularization at the Cleveland Clinic and correlated these findings with the preoperative serum creatinine level (S(Cr)) and other baseline risk factors.\nA retrospective review of hospital charts and outpatient records was supplemented with a telephone canvass and the invitation to return for a complimentary RA duplex scan, when a scan had not been done within the previous year. Data were collected for 73 consecutive patients (mean age, 69 years) who underwent aortic procedures that were combined with the repair of RA stenosis from 1989 to 1997 (mean follow-up, 44 months). The preoperative S(Cr) was 2 mg/dL or lower in 45 patients (group R1; median, 1.5 mg/dL) and was higher than 2 mg/dL in the remaining 28 patients (group R2; median, 2.6 mg/dL).\nForty-seven of the patients in this series had aortic aneurysms, 15 patients had aortoiliac occlusive disease, and 11 patients had both types of lesions. Bilateral RA revascularization was necessary for seven patients in group R1 (15%) and for eight patients in group R2 (29%). Group R2 contained more patients with medically resistant hypertension (57%) than group R1 (29%, P = .019). Although there was no statistically significant difference between the 30-day mortality rates (group R1, 2.2%; group R2, 11%), the related in-hospital mortality rate for 15 bilateral RA revascularizations (13%) was nearly twice that of 58 unilateral revascularizations (6.9%). Patients in group R2 were at a higher risk for postoperative dialysis than those in group R1 (36% vs 6.7%, P = .008), and patients in group R2 had longer lengths of stay in the hospital (median, 14 days vs 9 days; P = .004). By means of Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 5-year survival rate was lower for patients in group R2 (53%; 95% CI, 33%-73%) than for patients in group R1 (85%; 95% CI, 74%-96%; log rank P = .005). Despite all other liabilities in group R2 patients, however, their resistant hypertension was cured or improved in 88% of cases and their S(Cr) appeared to decline with time.\nThe early postoperative risk of simultaneous aortic/RA procedures appears to be highest in patients who have an elevated S(Cr), bilateral RA stenosis or occlusion, and a comparatively low long-term survival rate. In this particular group, the adjunctive use of endovascular techniques might conceivably reduce the magnitude of the planned surgical procedure and thus enhance the overall outcome.",

Although there was no statistically significant difference between the 30-day mortality rates (group R1, 2.2%; group R2, 11%), the related in-hospital mortality rate for 15 bilateral RA revascularizations (13%) was nearly twice that of 58 unilateral revascularizations (6.9%). Patients in group R2 were at a higher risk for postoperative dialysis than those in group R1 (36% vs 6.7%, P = .008), and patients in group R2 had longer lengths of stay in the hospital (median, 14 days vs 9 days; P = .004). By means of Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 5-year survival rate was lower for patients in group R2 (53%; 95% CI, 33%-73%) than for patients in group R1 (85%; 95% CI, 74%-96%; log rank P = .005). Despite all other liabilities in group R2 patients, however, their resistant hypertension was cured or improved in 88% of cases and their S(Cr) appeared to decline with time.",

    "abstract": "Paraplegia is the most dreaded and severe complication of surgery on the descending thoracic aorta (TAA) and thoracoabdominal aorta (TAAA). The functional integrity of the spinal cord can be monitored by means of intraoperative recording of myogenic-evoked responses after transcranial electrical stimulation (tcMEP) and somatosensory-evoked potential (SEP) monitoring. In this study, we evaluated the results of evoked potential monitoring and the adequacy of the strategy followed.\nThe spinal cord of 118 patients (78 men; age, 65 +/- 12 years; 79 TAAAs, 39 TAAs) undergoing surgery on the TAA or TAAA was monitored with tcMEP and SEP. Spinal cord protection was achieved by means of a multimodality approach: moderate hypothermia (32 degrees C rectal temperature), continuous cerebrospinal fluid drainage to keep the pressure less than 10 mm Hg, reimplantation of intercostal arteries, left ventricular bypass grafting, and staged clamping. In the case of evoked potential changes more than 50% of baseline, the strategy was adjusted: reattachment of more segmental arteries when technically feasible, higher distal and proximal perfusion pressures, and enhanced cerebrospinal fluid drainage.\nForty-two of 118 patients (35.6%) had a more than 50% of baseline tcMEP reduction during cross-clamping. At this point, only 5 of those 42 cases were also associated with SEP reduction of more than 50% of baseline. On the basis of the tcMEP findings, the strategy was adjusted.

    "abstract": "Through a systematic review of the literature, we identified the optimal management of traumatic ruptures of the thoracic aorta (TRTA) and reported the results of a cohort of patients treated with the clamp-and-sew technique (CAS) at a tertiary trauma center.\nStudies were identified through Medline and the Cochrane library and from reference lists and papers from the authors' files. Studies with a single consistent protocol (CAS, Gott shunt [GS], left heart bypass [LHB], or partial cardiopulmonary bypass [PCPB]) that reported mortality and neurologic outcomes were included. Relevance, validity, and data extraction were performed in duplicate. A retrospective review of charts from June 1992 to August 2000 provided the database for our experience.\nTwenty studies reporting on 618 patients were found to be relevant. Interobserver agreement for relevance and validity decisions was high. Mortality rates for repair with CAS, GS, LHB, and PCPB were 15%, 8%, 17%, and 10%, respectively, and for paraplegia they were 7%, 4%, 0%, and 2%, respectively. The difference in mortality rates was not statistically significant. CAS had a higher incidence of neurologic deficits than GS (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% CI, 0.4-8), LHB (OR, 6.4; 95% CI, 0.8-50), and PCPB (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1-10). In our cohort of 25 patients, 21 underwent surgery with CAS. The median abbreviated injury severity score was 20 (range, 4-50). The mean aortic clamp time was 30 +/- 12 minutes. Aortic repair was achieved with graft interposition in 43% of patients, and simple suture was achieved in 57% of patients. Mortality (10%) and neurologic complication (paraplegia, 11%; paraparesis, 5%) rates were not statistically different from those reported in the literature.\nCAS is associated with a similar mortality rate but a higher incidence of neurologic deficits than methods with distal aortic perfusion.",

Operative mortality and morbidity rates have been markedly improved because of recent advances in surgical techniques and anesthesiology. However, type A aortic dissection with an entry tear in the descending thoracic aorta is still a surgical challenge because of the need for extensive aortic replacement.\nTen patients with type A aortic dissection were treated with endovascular stent-grafts. The false lumen of the ascending aorta was patent in five patients, and it was thrombosed in the other five patients. The entry tears were located in the descending thoracic aorta in all cases. Seven patients had acute dissection, and three patients had subacute dissection. Four patients had pericardial effusion. Stent-grafts were fabricated from expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and Z-stents.\nEntry closure was achieved in all patients. Complete thrombosis of the false lumen of the ascending aorta was observed after stent-grafting in all patients. A second stent-graft was required in two patients to obtain complete thrombosis of the false lumen of the descending thoracic aorta. No procedure-related complications were observed, with the exception of a minor stroke in one patient. During a mean follow-up period of 20 months, no aortic rupture or aneurysm formation was noted in either the ascending or descending thoracic aorta, and all patients were alive and doing well. The abdominal aortic aneurysm enlarged after stent-grafting in one patient, and this was treated by closing the fenestrations of the abdominal aorta with stent-grafts.\nStent-graft repair of aortic dissection with an entry tear in the descending thoracic aorta is a safe and effective method and may be an alternative to surgical graft replacement in highly selected patients.",

    "abstract": "Anastomotic intimal hyperplasia remains a leading mechanism of prosthetic arterial graft failure. Recent studies using messenger RNA differential display have demonstrated altered proteasome gene expression at the anastomoses in an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene canine carotid model. However, this technique is technically limited because of a paucity of available hyperplastic tissue at early time periods after arterial injury. Microarray gene chip technology offers a new and sensitive technique to assay early gene expression, requiring far less tissue for analysis. The purpose of this study was to screen for altered proteasome gene expression at 48 hours and 14 days after prosthetic arterial grafting.\nExpanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (6-mm diameter, n = 9) were implanted into 25-kg mongrel dogs. The normal intervening carotid artery was used as control. At 48 hours and 14 days, RNA was extracted from the perianastomotic tissue and compared with RNA from the control carotid. Messenger RNA was then hybridized to microarray genomes screening for differential gene expression.\nTwo 26S proteasome genes and five ubiquitin pathway genes were significantly underexpressed at 48 hours, among several hundred significantly expressed clones. The two 26S proteasome genes were 26S proteasomal subunit p55 (0.26), and 26S proteasomal subunit p40.5 (0.13). The underexpressed ubiquitin genes included ubiquitin (0.31), Nedd-4-like ubiquitin-protein ligase (0.30), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UbcH2 (0.25), putative ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase UHX1 (0.11), and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7 (0.12). At 14 days, six ubiquitin genes were underexpressed, and 17 26S proteasome genes were significantly downregulated.\nThis study shows decreased expression of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway 48 hours after graft implantation and similar diminished expression patterns after 14 days. This early and sustained underexpression after arterial bypass may lead to altered cell cycle control and matrix protein signaling, contributing to the unregulated proliferation of smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix in anastomotic intimal hyperplasia after prosthetic arterial grafting.",

Patients were classified into PTP risk category by ED physicians before VDI. Correlation studies were completed using VDI as the gold standard. Charges associated with the protocol were calculated.\nOne hundred fourteen patients were included. The incidence of DVT was 9.6% (11). Thirty-six (55%) patients were classified as high risk, 23 (35%) as moderate, and 7 (10%) as low risk. All patients diagnosed with DVT were in the high-risk group (incidence, 16.7%). The sensitivity and negative predictive value were both 100% when PTP and D-dimer were used, but fell to 80% and 95%, respectively, when only D-dimer was considered. The true negative rates were 23% and 37%, respectively. Based on this study, we propose the following screening: for high-risk patients, use direct VDI (no D-dimer); for low-risk or moderate-risk patients, obtain D-dimer, and if it is positive, use VDI, and if it is negative, no further action is required. The average charge associated with the protocol was 170.50 dollars as opposed to 202.00 dollars for global VDI.\nA screening protocol using PTP along with selective D-dimer and VDI to exclude the diagnosis of DVT among ED patients is efficacious and cost efficient. This screening approach establishes criteria to satisfy billing requirements, can eliminate unnecessary VDI in 23% of ED referrals, and can reduce charges by 16%.",

Twenty patients underwent 26 vein patch angioplasties, and 17 patients underwent 24 balloon angioplasties. Four patients required four vein interpositions, and 12 patients underwent 12 revisions of the fistula to a more proximal level. Extended salvage procedures consisted of four turn-downs to the basilic vein for proximal cephalic vein thrombosis or stenosis and five extension bypasses to the axillary or jugular vein for subclavian vein thrombosis.\nFollow-up ranged from 1 to 31 months (mean, 10 months). The patients who underwent open revisions tended to need fewer subsequent procedures. However, primary patency of the vein patch angioplasty was not significantly better as compared with balloon angioplasty (P = .8) by life table analysis. Patency after revision of a radial cephalic fistula and brachial cephalic fistula were not statistically different. One interposition failed during the follow-up, and one revision to a more proximal level thrombosed during the follow-up. Two of the turn-down procedures had thrombosed at 2 and 11 months. The remaining two turn-down procedures have remained functional at 1 and 24 months. One of the extensions thrombosed at 8 months whereas the other four have remained functional at 1, 6, and 8 months.\nDespite the limited follow-up data, this review suggests that simple and extended salvage procedures may allow maturation and add to the life span of AVFs for hemodialysis. In addition, these data suggest an advantage for open techniques as compared with percutaneous techniques but only in terms of requiring fewer subsequent procedures.",

    "abstract": "Surgical repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms may be associated with a significant risk of perioperative morbidity including spinal cord ischemia, which occurs at a rate of between 5% and 21%. Spinal cord ischemia after endovascular repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) has also been reported. This investigation reviews the occurrence of spinal cord ischemia after endovascular repair of descending TAAs at the Mount Sinai Medical Center.\nBetween May 1997 and April 2001, 53 patients underwent endovascular exclusion of their TAA. Preprocedure computed tomography scanning and angiography were performed on all patients. All were performed in the operating room using C-arm fluoroscopy. Physical examinations and computed tomography scans were performed at discharge and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively and then annually thereafter. Spinal cord ischemia developed in three of the 53 patients (5.7%) postoperatively. In one patient, cord ischemia developed that manifested as early postoperative left leg weakness occurring after concomitant open infrarenal abdominal and endovascular TAA repair. The neurologic deficit resolved 12 hours after spinal drainage, steroid bolus, and the maintenance of hemodynamic stability. The remaining two patients developed delayed onset paralysis, one patient on the second postoperative day and the other patient 1 month postrepair. Both of these patients had previous abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and both required long grafts to exclude an extensive area of their thoracic aortas. Irreversible cord ischemia and paralysis occurred in both of these patients.\nEndovascular repair of TAA has shown a promising reduction in operative morbidity; however, the risk of spinal cord ischemia remains. Concomitant or previous abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and long segment thoracic aortic exclusion appear to be important risk factors. Spinal cord protective measures (ie, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, steroids, prevention of hypotension) should be used for patients with the aforementioned risk factors undergoing endovascular TAA repair.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the incidence, severity, and etiologic factors of the development of colon ischemia after endovascular aortoiliac aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nDuring the last 9 years we performed 278 elective EVARs using a variety of grafts. To facilitate these repairs, one hypogastric artery (HA) was coil embolized in 109 patients and both HAs were coil embolized in 13 patients. The preprocedural status of the inferior mesenteric, hypogastric, and iliac arteries as well as anatomical characteristics of the abdominal aortic aneurysm were determined arteriographically and by computerized tomographic scans. Postoperative colon ischemia was documented by colonoscopy or operative findings.\nColon ischemia occurred in eight patients (2.9%). Three patients with colon ischemia died and had evidence of widespread (cutaneous, renal, small bowel, and/or lower extremity) microembolization. One of these three had a colectomy and microscopic emboli were present. One other patient who required a colectomy also had pathologic evidence of colonic microembolization but survived. Four other patients with colon ischemia were treated conservatively and survived. In one patient, previous colectomy with interruption of mesenteric collaterals may have been a contributory cause of colon ischemia. Of the eight patients with colon ischemia, only one had unilateral HA occlusion, and none had bilateral HA occlusion. The other 121 patients with unilateral and bilateral HA occlusion had no evidence of colon ischemia.\nColon ischemia occurs after EVAR with an incidence approximating that of open repair. Colon ischemia was unrelated to HA interruption. Embolization appears to be a major cause of colon ischemia, although inadequate mesenteric collateral circulation may also play an etiologic role. Mortality with colon ischemia accompanied by widespread embolization was high, whereas colon ischemia without it was often mild and amenable to nonoperative management.",

No complications specifically related to this approach have previously been reported. We reviewed 18 cases of peroneal bypass for limb salvage using the lateral approach with fibula resection and found that two of these cases had ipsilateral tibia fractures within 1 year of the bypass. Eight out of 18 cases were women, and two of these eight had tibia fracture. Both women suffered from osteoporosis. We conclude that tibia fracture is a possible complication of this approach, especially in elderly women with osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "Iliac artery angioplasty (IAA) is an effective adjunct when combined with infrainguinal arterial reconstructions (IARs) in appropriate patients with multilevel occlusive disease. However, the effect of iliac artery stenting (IAS) on the outcome of patients undergoing distal bypass procedures is not defined. The purpose of this study was to estimate the influence of previous IAS for iliac occlusive disease on the outcome of IARs, compared with those after IAA alone or aortofemoral bypass grafting procedures (AFBs).\nDuring a 5-year period (1995-2000), 105 patients with previous intervention for iliac occlusive disease underwent 120 IARs. The criteria prepared by the Ad Hoc Committee on Reporting Standards (Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery) were followed to define the variables. The TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus classification was used to characterize the type of iliac lesions. Univariate (Kaplan-Meier) and multivariate analyses (Cox proportional hazards model) were used to determine the association between preoperative variables and cumulative primary patency.\nForty-five IARs were performed in patients with an earlier IAS repair, 33 in patients with an earlier IAA repair, and 42 in patients with an earlier AFB repair. There were not significant differences between patients in the IAS and IAA groups, except for a more frequent use of polytetrafluoroethylene grafts for IARs in the IAS group (40% vs 15%; chi(2) test, P = .03). The 5-year primary patency rate for IARs was 68% in the IAS group, 46% in the IAA group, and 61% in the AFB group. Univariate analyses revealed that primary patency rates for IARs in patients with previous IAS were significantly higher than those in the IAA group (Kaplan-Meier, log-rank test, P = .02). Previous IAA repair was associated with a two-fold increased risk of IAR graft failure (relative risk, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.8; P = .04).\nIARs in patients with previous IAS have significantly improved graft patency, compared with those in patients with previous IAA alone. Such graft patency for IAR after IAS is similar to that obtained after AFB repair.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to delineate the natural history of claudication and determine risk factors for ischemic rest pain (IRP) and ischemic ulceration (IU) among patients with claudication.\nWe prospectively collected data on 1244 men with claudication during a 15-year period, including demographics, clinical risk factors, and ankle-brachial index (ABI). We followed these patients serially with ABIs, self-reported walking distance (WalkDist), and monitoring for IRP and IU. We used Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazards modeling to find independent predictors of IRP and IU.\nMean follow-up was 45 months; statistically valid follow-up could be carried out for as long as 12 years. ABI declined an average of 0.014 per year. WalkDist declined at an average rate of 9.2 yards per year. The cumulative 10-year risks of development of IU and IRP were 23% and 30%, respectively. In multivariate analysis using several clinical risk factors, we found that only DM (relative risk [RR], 1.8) and ABI (RR, 2.2 for 0.1 decrease in ABI) predicted the development of IRP. Similarly, only DM (RR, 3.0) and ABI (RR, 1.9 for 0.1 decrease in ABI) were significant predictors of IU.\nThis large serial study of claudication is, to our knowledge, the longest of its kind. We documented an average rate of ABI decline of 0.014 per year and a decline in WalkDist of 9.2 yards per year. Two clinical factors, ABI and DM, were found to be associated with the development of IRP and IU. Our findings may be useful in predicting the clinical course of claudication.",

    "conclusions": "This large serial study of claudication is, to our knowledge, the longest of its kind. We documented an average rate of ABI decline of 0.014 per year and a decline in WalkDist of 9.2 yards per year. Two clinical factors, ABI and DM, were found to be associated with the development of IRP and IU. Our findings may be useful in predicting the clinical course of claudication.",

WalkDist declined at an average rate of 9.2 yards per year. The cumulative 10-year risks of development of IU and IRP were 23% and 30%, respectively. In multivariate analysis using several clinical risk factors, we found that only DM (relative risk [RR], 1.8) and ABI (RR, 2.2 for 0.1 decrease in ABI) predicted the development of IRP. Similarly, only DM (RR, 3.0) and ABI (RR, 1.9 for 0.1 decrease in ABI) were significant predictors of IU.",
