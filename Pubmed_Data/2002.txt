    "abstract": "Generally, when the origin of the word saphenous is discussed, most affirm that the term derives from the Greek word safaina, which means \"evident.\" The ancient Greeks knew only the caudal portion of the vein, and neither the Greeks nor the Romans used the term saphena. In fact, the term first appeared in the writings of Avicenna. In contrast, the term saphenous is derived from the Arabic el safin, which means \"hidden\" or \"concealed.\" Ancient Arabic physicians knew the anatomy of superficial veins of the human body and its extremities because they performed therapeutic bleeding. Arabic physicians phlebotomized the distal portion of the greater saphenous vein (GSV) at the ankle. Such phlebotomies were never performed on the proximal portions of the GSV because they were not superficial enough to be clearly evident. As a consequence, the proximal GSV was called el safin, or \"the concealed.\" The modern reader will recognize that based on duplex examination, the GSV is correctly identified on the basis of its deep position with the superficial fascia covering it. This information may be useful in modern saphenous vein surgery in identifying the proximal portion of the GSV.",

Local thigh ultrasound scanning and computed tomography revealed a mass within the superior third of the internal saphenous vein. The patient underwent surgical exploration and removal of the saphenous vein between the groin and the upper third of the leg. The resected vessel was surrounded and infiltrated by a whitish, rubbery tissue all along its course. The histologic findings were consistent with high-grade, diffuse, large-cell lymphoma of peripheral B lymphocyte origin, primarily arising in the saphenous vein. Antiactin monoclonal antibodies depicted the venous vascular wall infiltrated by tumor cells, confirming the lymphomatous localization within the saphenous vein. The patient is now alive and free of tumor 10 months after the operation.",

    "abstract": "Hyperhomocyst(e)inemia (hH[e]) is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Neointimal hyperplasia (NH) after vessel injury can contribute to atherosclerosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of hH(e) on NH formation after arterial balloon injury in rats.\nLewis rats that were given a hH(e)-inducing (high methionine, low folate) or normal diet for 150 days underwent common carotid artery (CCA) balloon injury. Two and 4 weeks after injury, CCAs were formalin perfusion-fixed, sectioned, and stained for elastin. Neointimal index (NI, percent lumen occlusion) and neointima (N) and media (M) area were measured by using computer-interfaced microscopy.\nPlasma homocyst(e)ine (H[e]) levels were elevated in rats given the study diet compared with rats given the normal diet at days 40 and 90 (69 +/- 8 and 73 +/- 9 micromol/L vs 4 +/- 0.4 and 4 +/- 0.6 micromol/L, P <.001). After balloon injury, the CCA NI and N/M ratio, but not the M area, were increased by hH(e) compared with normal plasma H(e) (2 weeks [n = 6,7]: NI = 7.3 +/- 1.7 vs 2.9 +/- 0.7, P =.002, and N/M = 0.31 +/- 0.08 vs 0.08 +/- 0.02, P <.001; 4 weeks [n = 4,7]: NI = 13.1 +/- 2.2 vs 6.3 +/- 1.3, P =.002, and N/M = 0.36 +/- 0.08 vs 0.17 +/- 0.03, P <.001).\nhH(e) accelerates NH in a rat CCA balloon-injury model.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was the validation of the physiologic appropriateness of in vitro organ culture of human saphenous vein as a model with the demonstration of the occurrence of the processes of cell proliferation, remodeling, and hyperplasia.\nSaphenous vein from 28 patients was cross-sectioned into seven 2-mm segments and maintained in organ culture for 2 days or 2 weeks. Three organ culture media were used: a chemically well-defined medium (RPMI-1640) and the same medium supplemented with the undefined protein-containing supplements fetal bovine serum (FBS) or pooled adult human plasma (type AB). The outcome measures at 2 days and 2 weeks were compared with measurements of segments from the same vein at the time of harvest. Excess saphenous vein harvested for arterial bypass grafting was obtained after approval of the study protocol by the Institutional Review Board. Cell proliferation was measured with immunostaining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Remodeling and intimal hyperplasia were measured with micromorphometric comparisons of vein segment cross-sectional area before and after organ culture.\nThere was no evidence of cell death or tissue degeneration on histologic examination of the cultured vein segments. Cell proliferation, expressed as proliferation index (PI; positive proliferating cell nuclear antigen nuclei/total nuclei), significantly increased as compared with freshly harvested vein after 2 days of culture in undefined, protein-supplemented media (mean PI, 42.4 +/- 7.4%; P <.001). A significant increase in cell proliferation did not occur in the defined, unsupplemented medium until 2 weeks (mean PI, 16.2 +/- 7.1%; P <.001). The cross-sectional area of the vein wall increased during culture in all media. A statistically significant increase in the cross-sectional area of the vein wall occurred during culture with plasma (P <.001) and FBS supplementation (P =.002). The increase in the cross-sectional area of the vein in defined media was almost statistically significant (P =.089). A significant increase was seen in the cross-sectional area of the media (P =.006) and adventitia (P =.030) of veins cultured with plasma supplementation and in the cross-sectional area of the adventitia (P =.034) of veins cultured with FBS supplementation.\nThese results show that human saphenous vein in culture is viable, shows cell proliferation, and exhibits remodeling of the layers of the vein wall. This is the first report to document hyperplasia in human vascular tissue cultured in a defined medium.",

A statistically significant increase in the cross-sectional area of the vein wall occurred during culture with plasma (P <.001) and FBS supplementation (P =.002). The increase in the cross-sectional area of the vein in defined media was almost statistically significant (P =.089).

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was a description of changes in gene expression that occur in response to mechanical injury of cultured human saphenous vein.\nRestriction fragment differential display (Display Systems Biotech, Vista, Calif) was used for the comparison of the gene expression profile in seven sets of vein, with the first set representing gene expression at the time of harvest of the vein and the other six sets representing different lengths of time in culture with or without crush injury. All seven sets were from a single, freshly harvested vein. Each set contained eight separate vein segments. The first set (Set 1) was taken from the freshly harvested vein, and the RNA was immediately extracted. This set reflects the in vivo gene expression profile at the time of harvest. Three sets of vein segments (Sets 2, 4, and 6) were cultured for 24, 48, or 72 hours after harvest (culture only). Three sets of vein segments (Sets 3, 5, and 7) were harvested, crush-injured, and then cultured for 24, 48, or 72 hours (crush injury + culture). The gene expression profiles of these six cultured sets of vein segments were compared with the gene expression profile of the set of vein segments that were obtained at harvest.\nThe crush injury of the vein segments resulted in the up-regulated expression of 21 identified (including inducible nitric oxide synthase) and nine unknown genes and in the down-regulated expression of eight identified and seven unknown genes within the first 72 hours after harvest. The vein segments that were cultured without crush injury had the up-regulated expression of nine identified and seven unknown genes and the down-regulated expression of five identified (including platelet-derived growth factor-B and transforming growth factor-beta2) and seven unknown genes within the first 72 hours after harvest. The pattern of gene regulation after transmural crush injury revealed eight genes whose products support cell migration and seven genes whose products oppose cell proliferation.\nThe comparison of gene expression between those vein segments designated culture only and those vein segments designated crush injury and culture shows that some cells of the vein segments express phenotypic changes that are consistent with cell migration. Further studies of gene expression changes in vitro may elucidate the endogenous response of vascular tissue to injury.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to determine whether there is a generalized trend of progressive enlargement of the common and internal carotid bulbs after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) reconstruction with saphenous vein patches.\nTwenty-nine autologous greater saphenous vein-patched CEAs performed between 1983 and 1994 were examined with five to nine sequential duplex scans each that included B-mode measurements of both the common carotid bulb (CCB) and internal carotid bulb (ICB) diameters. A total of 186 scans of each of the two segments were performed from 2 to 182 months after CEA (mean, 64 months). The time from the first to the last scan ranged from 30 to 120 months (mean, 76 months). Repeated measures analysis of variance was used as a means of testing the relationship of CCB and ICB diameters with time from CEA and with time from the first scan. Simple linear regression was used as a means of analyzing the variability of individual CCB and ICB diameters and pooled normalized diameters in both time frames.\nThe CCB diameters ranged from 8.4 to 18.5 mm (mean, 13.1 mm), and the ICB diameters ranged from 6.4 to 16.0 mm (mean, 11.2 mm). No significant relationship between both CCB and ICB diameters in the time from CEA or the time from the first scan (P =.643 to.913), for sex (P =.403 to.917), or for early and late post-CEA time of study onset (P =.135 to.773) was shown by means of repeated measures analysis. Low R(2) values (CCB mean, 0.17; ICB mean, 0.21) and non-significant P values for regression slope (CCB mean, 0.46; ICB mean, 0.54) were given by means of individual regression analysis. There was no correlation between individual regression coefficients and the mean diameters of the arteries. The mean change in CCB diameter was 0.023 mm/year (range, -0.37 to 0.30 mm/year), and the mean change in ICB diameter was -0.030 mm/year (range, -0.33 to 0.37 mm/year). Regression of normalized CCB and ICB diameters versus time gave R(2) values less than 0.02 and slopes not statistically significantly different from zero. The predicted 10-year average percent change in normalized diameters ranged from 0.8% to 3.3%.\nIn a 15-year period after CEA and a 10-year sequential B-mode scan study period, there was no evidence of significant enlargement of saphenous vein-patched CEAs. This is also true for CEAs in men and women and for subsets with larger and smaller CCB and ICB diameters and early and late scan onset times. Dilatation after saphenous vein patching is most likely a rare isolated event and not the result of generalized or frequent progressive enlargement.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have reported that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with patch angioplasty has results that are superior to primary closure. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patching has been shown to have results comparable with autogenous vein patching; however, it requires a prolonged hemostasis time. Therefore, many surgeons are using collagen-impregnated Dacron patching (Hemashield [HP]). This study is the first prospective randomized trial comparing CEA with PTFE patching versus HP patching.\nTwo hundred CEAs were randomized into two groups, 100 PTFE and 100 HP patching. All patients underwent immediate postoperative and 1-month postoperative color duplex ultrasound scanning studies. Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in both groups, including the mean operative diameter of the internal carotid artery.\nThe perioperative stroke rates were 0% for PTFE, versus 7% for HP (4 major and 3 minor strokes, P =.02). The combined perioperative stroke and transient ischemic attack rates were 3% for PTFE, versus 12% for HP (P =.047). The operative mortality rate for PTFE was 0%, versus 2% for HP (P =.477). Five perioperative carotid thromboses were noted in patients undergoing HP patching, versus none in patients undergoing PTFE patching (P =.07). After 1 month of follow-up, 2% of patients in the PTFE group had a 50% or more restenosis, versus 12% of patients in the HP group (P =.013). The mean operative time for PTFE patching was 119 minutes, versus 113 minutes for HP patching (P =.081). The mean hemostasis time was significantly higher for PTFE patching than for HP patching, 14.4 versus 3.4 minutes (P <.001).\nCEA with HP patching had a higher incidence of perioperative strokes, carotid thrombosis, and 50% or more early restenosis than CEA with PTFE patching. However, the mean hemostasis time was higher for PTFE patching than for HP patching.",

Follow-up (mean 10 months, range 6 to 17) demonstrated exclusion of the abdominal aortic aneurysm and common iliac artery aneurysms with no endoleak and patent external iliac artery-to-internal iliac artery endografts in all patients.",

    "abstract": "Twenty-nine patients underwent placement of the Teramed Ariba Endovascular Graft System (Maple Grove, Minn) as part of a European Feasibility study (14 patients) and a US phase I trial (15 patients). Salient features of this modular endograft system include a crimped seamless polyester bifurcation graft supplied in three diameters and three iliac limb lengths, three types of nitinol stents including a suprarenal stent with aortic barbs, a flexible delivery system capable of controlled incremental sheath retraction, a flexible tapered lead balloon, and a telescoping technique for adjusting the length of graft coverage during surgery over a range of 3 cm. Twenty-eight of the 29 patients met the primary objective of this evaluation, which was to confirm the safety of the system, defined as the absence of major device-related adverse events and type I, III, or IV endoleaks within 1 month of implantation. Three major adverse events occurred within 1 month of discharge: renal failure, which was related to deployment of the device close to the renal arteries; pulmonary edema, which was related to the procedure but not the device; and peripheral ischemia, which was related to the patient's pre-existing condition. Seven patients had type II endoleaks noted by means of computed tomography scanning at 1 month; the endoleaks were identified by means of angiography and classified at the time of surgery. There were no deaths, aneurysm ruptures, stent-graft migrations, stent fractures, graft ruptures, graft thromboses, or surgical conversions at 1 month. This early clinical experience indicates that the Ariba Bifurcated Endovascular System can be safely implanted.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that transrenal artery fixation of endovascular stent-grafts is safe and may be a desirable means of reducing the risk of type I endoleaks, particularly those with short infrarenal necks. The close proximity of the superior mesenteric and celiac arteries to the renal arteries may commonly result in the placement of the stent struts across all the vessels of the visceral segment of the aorta. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and impact of transvisceral artery fixation during aortic stent-graft deployment for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).\nFrom January 1997 to June 1999, 192 patients (165 men, 27 women; mean age, 82 years) with AAAs were treated with an endovascular graft secured proximally to the aorta with a long (15 mm) uncovered stent segment (60 Parodi/Palmaz, 132 Talent-LPS). Preoperative and postoperative abdominal aortograms and intravenous contrast enhanced spiral computed tomography (CT) scans were performed. Follow-up CT scans were obtained at 3, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter as a means of determining stent position and visceral artery patency\nIn 95 patients (49%), the uncovered stent was at or above the level of the superior mesenteric artery. In 23 patients (12%), the stent extended to the level of the celiac axis. In a mean follow-up period of 25 months (range, 6-44 months), serum creatinine levels remained stable, no stenoses or occlusions occurred in the celiac, superior mesenteric, or renal arteries, and no evidence of renal, hepatic, splenic, or intestinal infarction was present on contrast enhanced spiral CT scans. There were no type I endoleaks.\nTransvisceral fixation of the uncovered proximal aortic stent occurs frequently during deployment of devices designed for transrenal fixation and is associated with no early morbidity. Long-term follow-up is necessary to ensure that there are no late sequelae.",

    "abstract": "The causative role of consumptive coagulopathy in the development of bleeding complications after supraceliac (SC) aortic cross-clamping (AXC) has been challenged by recent reports that ascribe this coagulopathy to primary fibrinolysis. This theory is made on the basis of evidence that tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen (Ag) levels increase after SC AXC. However, t-PA Ag levels reflect both active and inactive (bound to serum t-PA inhibitors) forms of serum t-PA, and elevations confirm the presence of fibrinolysis only in conjunction with an increase in t-PA activity.\nTo investigate the etiology of this coagulopathy, we submitted eight pigs to SC AXC and six pigs to infrarenal (IR) AXC for 30 minutes. Blood was drawn from the portal vein, the hepatic vein, and the carotid artery before AXC, just before unclamping, and 5, 30, and 60 minutes after unclamping. Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen (FBG), platelets (PLT), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT), t-PA Ag, t-PA activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and alpha2-antiplasmin (AP) activities were measured. Statistical analysis was performed by using repeated measures analysis of variance and t tests\nThe PT did not differ between the two groups at any point. After unclamping, in the SC group there was a drop in PLT levels (P =.005), a decrease in FBG levels (P <.001), and a trend toward PTT prolongation (P =.06) compared with baseline. In contrast, there were no changes in PTT, PLT levels, or FBG levels in the IR group. TAT, a serum marker of thrombin generation, increased with SC AXC (P =.04), remained elevated 5 minutes after unclamping (P =.08), and returned to normal 30 minutes after unclamping. In contrast, TAT levels did not change in the IR control group. In the SC AXC group, the TAT levels did not differ between the three test sites at any time. SC AXC was associated with an increase in t-PA Ag just before unclamping (P <.001) and 5 minutes after unclamping (P =.002), but IR AXC was not. t-PA activity levels decreased in both experimental groups 30 and 60 minutes after unclamping. Levels of alpha2-AP activity decreased to a similar degree in both groups after unclamping when compared with baseline\nThirty minutes of SC AXC results in intravascular thrombosis that cannot be localized to the ischemic visceral circulation. This intravascular thrombosis is associated with consumption of clotting factors. Thirty minutes of SC AXC causes an activation of fibrinolytic pathways that does not result in a hyperfibrinolytic state. An increase in t-PA Ag without a rise in t-PA activity does not represent true fibrinolysis, but rather an increase in the bound, inactive forms of serum t-PA. Both IR and SC AXC result in decreased fibrinolytic activity (\"fibrinolytic shutdown\") after release of the aortic clamp.",

    "abstract": "This study reviewed the long-term outcome of patients who underwent open repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).\nA retrospective study of 208 patients (188 men and 20 women) with a mean age of 65.6 years who survived elective or emergency open repair of an infrarenal AAA was conducted at a university referral hospital. Main outcome measures included late graft-related complications, survival free from any reintervention, survival free from any vascular reintervention, and overall survival rates.\nLate graft-related complications occurred in 32 patients (15.4%). A proximal para-anastomotic pseudoaneurysm developed in six patients (2.9%), and a distal pseudoaneurysm developed in 18 patients (8.7%); in seven of these cases (3.4%), it was bilateral or recurrent. A graft limb occlusion occurred in 11 patients (5.3%). These complications required 37 surgical or other invasive procedures in 27 patients (13.0%). Thirty-one vascular and/or endovascular reoperations were performed. The 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year survival free from any reintervention rates were 91.5%, 86.2%, and 72.0%, respectively. At the same intervals, the survival free from any vascular reintervention rates were 93.8%, 88.5%, and 73.9%, respectively, and the overall survival rates were 66.8%, 39.4%, and 18.0%, respectively. Complications associated with a ruptured femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, a ruptured aortic pseudoaneurysm, an aortoduodenal fistula, and the elective repair of a femoral pseudoaneurysm were the graft-related causes of death, which occurred in four patients (1.9%). Age (P <.0001) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P =.002) were shown by means of multivariate analysis to be predictive of poor survival outcome, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P =.02) and lower limb ischemia (P =.04) were shown to be associated with an increased need for vascular reinterventions to treat graft-related complications.\nOpen repair of infrarenal AAAs can achieve satisfactory 15-year follow-up rates of survival free from reintervention for any graft-related complications, suggesting that surgery should still be considered the procedure of choice for infrarenal AAAs, at least in patients who are fit for surgery.",

A proximal para-anastomotic pseudoaneurysm developed in six patients (2.9%), and a distal pseudoaneurysm developed in 18 patients (8.7%); in seven of these cases (3.4%), it was bilateral or recurrent. A graft limb occlusion occurred in 11 patients (5.3%). These complications required 37 surgical or other invasive procedures in 27 patients (13.0%). Thirty-one vascular and/or endovascular reoperations were performed. The 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year survival free from any reintervention rates were 91.5%, 86.2%, and 72.0%, respectively. At the same intervals, the survival free from any vascular reintervention rates were 93.8%, 88.5%, and 73.9%, respectively, and the overall survival rates were 66.8%, 39.4%, and 18.0%, respectively. Complications associated with a ruptured femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, a ruptured aortic pseudoaneurysm, an aortoduodenal fistula, and the elective repair of a femoral pseudoaneurysm were the graft-related causes of death, which occurred in four patients (1.9%). Age (P <.0001) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P =.002) were shown by means of multivariate analysis to be predictive of poor survival outcome, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P =.02) and lower limb ischemia (P =.04) were shown to be associated with an increased need for vascular reinterventions to treat graft-related complications.",

    "abstract": "In situ repair with cryopreserved vascular allografts improves the results in the surgical treatment of aortic infection. This study evaluated the technical pitfalls with the use of allografts that influence early and midterm mortality.\nBetween 1990 and 1999, 49 patients, 21 (43%) with a mycotic aneurysm and 28 (57%) with a prosthetic graft infection of the thoracic and abdominal aorta including pelvic and groin vessels, underwent in situ repair with cryopreserved arterial allografts. Seventeen patients (35%) had aortobronchial, aortoesophageal, or aortoenteric fistulas.\nAllograft-related technical problems occurred in eight patients (16%) in this series, and they included: intraoperative rupture caused by allograft friability; allograftenteric fistula from ligated allograft side branches rupturing 8, 18, and 48 months after implantation; anastomotic failure caused by inappropriate mechanical stress; anastomotic stricture after partial replacement of infected prosthetic grafts; allograft failure caused by inappropriate wound drainage; and recurrence of infection after inappropriate duration of antifungal treatment. Seven of the eight technical problems (87%) occurred in the first 10 patients (80%) in this series. There was one technical failure in the remaining 39 patients (2.6%; P =.0002) because of various technical adaptations, such as critical selection of allografts, use of allograft strips supporting large anastomoses, sealing with antibiotic-impregnated fibrin glue, and change in technique of allograft side-branch ligature. The 30-day mortality rate was 6% for the whole series; however, it was 2.6% for last 39 patients, with no recurrence of infection or allograft-related late death.\nIn situ repair with cryopreserved arterial allografts achieves excellent early and late results in the treatment of aortic infection. However, distinct allograft-related technical problems had to be overcome to improve the outcome of patients with major vascular infections.",

Patients were observed for a mean of 2.5 years. The primary end point was the mean annual growth rate as determined by means of ultrasound scanning performed every 6 months. Secondary outcomes were death, surgery, withdrawal from study medication, and quality of life measured by means of the Short-form Health Survey (SF-36). The main analyses were performed by means of intention to treat.\nThe two groups were similar at baseline: 84% were men with a mean age of 69 years and a mean AAA size of 3.8 cm. Fewer patients in the placebo group stopped their study medication (26.8% vs 42.4%; P =.0002).

    "abstract": "Biological material has been used as an alternative to autogenous vein since the first lower extremity revascularization procedures were performed. Our experience with glutaraldehyde-tanned human umbilical cord vein graft (UVg), which spanned a period of 28 years, forms the basis of this report, with an emphasis on comparative results between the two decades from 1975 to 1985 and from 1990 to 2000.\nBetween 1990 and 2000, 283 lower extremity bypass grafting procedures were performed in 230 patients (264 limbs), with UVg used as the predominant, or sole, graft material. Our experience with 907 reconstructions in the decade from 1975 to 1985 has been previously documented and now serves as a baseline comparison with the past decade of experience with UVg. Each reconstruction was classified on the basis of the distal anastomotic site with or without distal arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs). The primary and secondary graft patency rates were determined for each category as was cumulative palliation, which combines the end points of graft failure, amputation, and death.\nThe results from the second decade (1990 to 2000) showed a continuation of improving patency rates for UVg grafts in lower extremity revascularization. Comparison results of complications showed no changes in the low incidence rates of infection, stenosis, dissection, and pseudoaneurysm. The original series results showed a 2.9% requirement for aneurysm surgery, with an incidence rate of biodegradation of 57% (36% aneurysms, 21% dilation), whereas the current series results have shown no aneurysms to date. The comparative 6-year secondary patency rates for past and current popliteal and crural bypass grafts (with or without dAVF) were: popliteal, 53% versus 67%, P <.05; and crural, 26% without dAVF versus 47% with dAVF, P <.05. The limb salvage rates for the two series at 6 years showed no significant changes between the decades and the types of bypass grafts. Thrombolysis was performed during the decade from 1990 to 2000 in 27 UVg cases, with lysis achieved in 23 cases (85%) and limb salvage achieved in 20 cases (74%). Since 1996, associated endovascular procedures (fluoroscopy, angioplasty) have assumed increasing importance in the reduction of perioperative graft closure and in the enhancement of patency.\nOur continuing experience with UVg confirms that favorable results can be obtained with this biologic alternative to autologous vein for lower limb revascularization. Concern regarding biodegradation and aneurysm formation even after 5 years are unfounded at this time. Improved patency and limb salvage rates can be achieved in concert with lower nonthrombotic failure rates, increasing performance of associated endovascular procedures, use of tourniquets, and the addition of dAVF for crural bypass grafting. Prospective randomized studies are still necessary for the assessment of the comparative role of all graft materials, a project that continues to evade our specialty.",

    "abstract": "Reversed lower-extremity vein grafts (LEVGs) frequently require operative revisions to maintain patency. Identifying grafts that are at risk, however, requires an intensive duplex scanning-based surveillance program. Excellent 5-year graft patency and limb-salvage rates have previously been reported in patients undergoing graft revisions, but results beyond 5 years are essentially unknown, a factor that is of importance in an increasingly aging population. This study was performed to determine the results of surgical revisions of LEVGs after a follow-up as long as 10 years.\nAll patients undergoing placement of a LEVG were observed in a program of duplex scanning-based surveillance as long as the patient remained a candidate for graft revision. Grafts were considered for revision on the basis of the presence of focal areas of increased velocity, a prestenotic to intrastenotic velocity ratio more than 3.0, or uniformly low velocities throughout the graft. All lesions were confirmed with preoperative arteriography before revision. Assisted primary patency, limb-salvage, and survival rates were determined by means of Kaplan-Meier analysis in all patients who underwent LEVG revision from January 1990 to December 2000.\nA total of 1498 LEVG procedures were performed during the study period. A total of 330 surgical graft revisions were performed on 259 extremities in 245 patients. The median follow-up period was 38 months. The assisted primary patency rate of all grafts, the limb-salvage rate for patients undergoing surgery for limb-salvage indications, and the survival rate of all patients were 87.4%, 88.7%, and 72.4%, respectively, 5 years after the original bypass grafting procedure, 85.7%, 83.4%, and 67.8%, respectively, 7 years after the original bypass grafting procedure, and 80.4%, 75.4%, and 53.4%, respectively, 10 years after the original bypass grafting procedure. A total of 180 revisions (55%) were performed during the first year, 110 (33%) between the first year and the fifth year, and 40 revisions (12%) were performed on grafts older than 5 years. LEVGs revised within the first year after bypass grafting had lesions within the graft in 78%, in the native arterial inflow in 10%, and in the native arterial outflow in 12%. This differed significantly from the location of lesions in revisions performed between 1 and 5 years and after 5 years (graft, 63% and 62%; inflow, 20% and 19%; outflow, 17% and 19%; P >.05, Chi-square).\nExcellent assisted primary patency and limb-salvage rates can be achieved for as long as 10 years in LEVGs that require revision, with only a 7% drop in overall patency and limb-salvage rates between the fifth and 10th years. Although most revisions were required within the first year, 34% were performed between the first year and the fifth year, and 11% after 5 years. These data support the growing body of evidence that favors an aggressive regimen of duplex scanning surveillance of LEVGs for the life of the graft. Revised grafts have excellent patency through 10 years.",

    "abstract": "Infrainguinal bypass grafting with a proximal anastomosis distal to the groin has been used increasingly to conserve available conduit and reduce wound morbidity and recovery time. The usefulness of the liberalized use of distal origin grafts (DOGs) is unknown.\nConsecutive autogenous DOG procedures that were performed between 1978 and 2000 were reviewed retrospectively with a computerized registry. Procedures performed as revisions to earlier infrainguinal bypass grafting procedures and for popliteal aneurysm were excluded.\nIn the 22-year study period, 249 autogenous DOG procedures were performed in 217 patients. Comparison of the 159 DOGs in patients with diabetes mellitus (+DM) with the 90 grafts in patients without diabetes mellitus (-DM) revealed more associated renal disease (33% vs 9%), preoperative foot necrosis (80% vs 52%), distal popliteal artery graft origins (49% vs 37%), and non-greater saphenous conduits used (30% vs 19%) among the +DM subgroup than the -DM subgroup (P <.05). The operative mortality rate was 2.0%, the major morbidity rate was 8.8%, the early graft failure rate was 6.4%, and the early amputation rate was 2.4%, with no differences related to diabetes mellitus. Follow-up was complete in 92% of patients in a mean interval of 27 months. At 5 years, cumulative primary graft patency rates were 62% overall, 73% for the +DM subgroup, and 45% for the -DM subgroup (P <.001).

    "abstract": "There have been few studies of the natural history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and none have used serial noninvasive laboratory examinations for the objective quantification of disease progression. The relationship between the site of initial symptoms of PAD (lower-extremity disease [LED] vs cerebrovascular disease [CVD]) and the site of subsequent symptomatic progression (LED vs CVD vs coronary heart disease [CHD]) has not been examined.\nThis is a long-term, blinded prospective clinical research study of the relationship of PAD progression to multiple clinical, laboratory, and noninvasive vascular laboratory parameters. Patients with symptomatic LED, CVD, or both underwent comprehensive risk-factor assessment and were seen every 6 months for follow-up examinations. In addition to history and physical examination, all subjects underwent serial noninvasive lower-extremity and carotid artery testing. The relationship between the initial symptomatic site(s) and subsequent progression was examined by means of multivariate proportional hazards analysis, which was adjusted for age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, cholesterol, homocysteine level, lowest initial ankle/brachial index (ABI), worst carotid stenosis, ABI progression, and carotid stenosis progression, because each of these factors was significantly associated with one or more aspects of progression.\nThere were 397 study subjects (mean age, 66 years; 38% women) with a mean follow-up period of 48.5 months. LED was initially present in 88% of subjects and CVD in 37% of subjects (both were present in 25% of subjects). There were 78 deaths, 47 (60%) of which were caused by cardiovascular disease (18% mortality rate after 5 years by means of life table). Progression of disease as documented by means of vascular laboratory findings occurred in 90% of subjects by means of life table after 5 years (ABI progression, 31%; carotid stenosis progression, 40%). Symptomatic clinical progression of disease occurred in 52% of subjects by means of life table after 5 years (LED progression, 22%; CVD progression, 23%; CHD progression, 31%). By means of multivariate analysis, no significant relationship was found between the site of initial symptoms of PAD and the site(s) of subsequent symptomatic clinical progression (LED vs CVD vs CHD; P = not significant for all hazard ratios).\nPatients with symptomatic PAD experience symptoms of ongoing LED, CVD, and CHD with a frequency that is not influenced by the site(s) of their original symptoms.

    "abstract": "In patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs), the blood supply to the spinal cord is highly variable and unpredictable because of obstructed intercostal and lumbar arteries. This study was performed for the prospective documentation of patent segmental arteries during TAAA repair and the assessment of their functional contribution to the spinal cord blood supply.\nTAAA repair was performed in 184 consecutive patients (68 with type I aneurysm, 91 with type II, and 25 with type III) according to a protocol that included left heart bypass grafting, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and the monitoring of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). Patent intercostal and lumbar arteries were documented, and all reattached, selectively grafted, and oversewn segmental arteries were noted. MEP amplitude that decreased to less than 25% of baseline was considered an indication of critical spinal cord ischemia and prompted spinal cord revascularization.\nAdequate MEP levels were encountered in 183 of 184 patients. One patient had early paraplegia (absent MEPs), two patients had delayed paraplegia develop, and two patients had temporary paraparesis, which accounted for an overall neurologic deficit of 2.7%. The median total number of patent intercostal and lumbar arteries in type I, II, and III aneurysms was three, five, and five, respectively. In eight of 68 type I cases, no segmental arteries were seen between the fifth thoracic vertebrae (T5) and the first lumbar vertebrae (L1) and MEP levels remained adequate because of distal aortic perfusion. In 18 of 91 type II cases, the aortic segment T5 to L1 did not contain patent arteries, and in six of these patients, the segment L1 to L5 did not have lumbar arteries either. In the latter patients, MEP levels depended on the pelvic circulation provided with the left heart bypass graft. In the other 12 of 91 type II cases, the only patent arteries were the lumbar arteries between L3 and L5. The loss of MEPs could be corrected with the reattachment of these arteries. In seven of 25 type III cases, the MEP levels also depended on lumbar arteries L3 to L5 and in three of 25 cases, no segmental arteries were available and MEP levels recovered after the reperfusion of the pelvic circulation. With the combination of the findings of type II and III cases, spinal cord perfusion was directed by lower lumbar arteries in 16% of the cases (19 of 116) and pelvic circulation in 8% of the cases (nine of 116).\nIn patients with TAAA, most intercostal and lumbar arteries are occluded and spinal cord perfusion depends on an eminent collateral network, which includes lumbar arteries and pelvic circulation. The monitoring of MEPs is a sensitive technique for the assessment of spinal cord ischemia and the identification of segmental arteries that critically contribute to spinal cord perfusion. Surgical strategies on the basis of this technique reduced the incidence rate of neurologic deficit to less than 3%.",

    "abstract": "The exact significance of collateral endoleaks is unknown and a topic of great debate. Because of this uncertainty, some physicians choose to watch and wait while others aggressively treat these leaks. The purpose of this investigation was the evaluation of the efficacy of the two techniques used in the treatment of collateral endoleaks that occur after endovascular aneurysm repair.\nPatients with 33 angiographically proven type 2 endoleaks underwent treatment with either transarterial inferior mesenteric artery embolization (n = 20) or direct translumbar embolization (n = 13) during an 18-month period. Embolization success was defined as resolution of endoleak on all subsequent computed tomography angiogram results. The likelihood of embolization failure between the two treatments was expressed as a risk ratio and was compared with Fisher exact test.\nSixteen of 20 transarterial inferior mesenteric artery embolizations (80%) failed with recanalization of the original endoleak cavity over time. A single failure (8%) in the direct translumbar embolization group occurred in a patient in whom a new attachment site leak developed. The remaining 12 translumbar endoleak embolizations (92%) were successful and durable, with a median follow-up period of 254 days. The patients who underwent transarterial inferior mesenteric artery embolization were significantly more likely to have persistent endoleak than were the patients who underwent treatment with direct translumbar embolization (risk ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.9 to 11.2; P =.0001).\nThe transarterial embolization of inferior mesenteric arteries for the repair of type 2 endoleaks is ineffective and should not be performed. Direct translumbar embolization of the endoleak is effective in the elimination of type 2 leaks and should be the therapy of choice when aggressive endoleak management is indicated.",

    "abstract": "Carotid angioplasty and stenting is under investigation in clinical trials as an alternative to endarterectomy. Some clinicians have hypothesized that stenting would be applicable for patients at high risk who need carotid revascularization. To further test this hypothesis, we stratified our carotid endarterectomy procedures according to current carotid stent protocols.\nWe reviewed our computerized registry and the clinical charts of patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy. Each procedure was categorized as high risk or low risk, according to the following six separate high-risk factors: 1, severe cardiac dysfunction; 2, the requirement for combined coronary and carotid vascularization; 3, severe pulmonary dysfunction; 4, contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion; 5, previous ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy; and 6, anatomically limited access for carotid endarterectomy. Rates of stroke at 30 days, cardiac complications, and death were tabulated.\nBetween January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2000, 415 carotid endarterectomies were performed on 389 patients. Ninety-eight procedures (23.6%) were classified as high risk on the basis of the following factors: 1, severe cardiac dysfunction (n = 30); 2, requirement for combined coronary and carotid revascularization (n = 14); 3, severe pulmonary dysfunction (n = 8); 4, contralateral carotid occlusion (n = 31); 5, previous ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy (n = 25); and 6, anatomically limited access (n = 4). Seven patients had ipsilateral postoperative strokes (1.7%), with two additional patients having contralateral hemispheric strokes. One patient died from exacerbation of congestive heart failure 9 days after undergoing a second carotid endarterectomy. The total stroke and death rate was 2.6% for all the patients. Two of the 98 procedures in the high-risk group were complicated with ipsilateral stroke (2.0%) as compared with six of the 317 low-risk procedures (1.9%; P = 1). Six procedures were complicated with cardiac dysfunction after surgery, including myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or the new onset of atrial fibrillation. Three cardiac complications occurred in the low-risk group (1%), and three occurred in the high-risk group (3.1%; P =.15).\nThis series shows that patients at high risk can undergo carotid endarterectomy with stroke rates equivalent to the rates of patients at low risk. The cardiac morbidity rate may be increased in the high-risk group. Carotid stenting is unlikely to offer any improvement in stroke risk as compared with carotid endarterectomy, but stenting may reduce non-stroke morbidity rates associated with some high-risk cases.",

The cardiac morbidity rate may be increased in the high-risk group. Carotid stenting is unlikely to offer any improvement in stroke risk as compared with carotid endarterectomy, but stenting may reduce non-stroke morbidity rates associated with some high-risk cases.",

Ninety-eight procedures (23.6%) were classified as high risk on the basis of the following factors: 1, severe cardiac dysfunction (n = 30); 2, requirement for combined coronary and carotid revascularization (n = 14); 3, severe pulmonary dysfunction (n = 8); 4, contralateral carotid occlusion (n = 31); 5, previous ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy (n = 25); and 6, anatomically limited access (n = 4). Seven patients had ipsilateral postoperative strokes (1.7%), with two additional patients having contralateral hemispheric strokes. One patient died from exacerbation of congestive heart failure 9 days after undergoing a second carotid endarterectomy. The total stroke and death rate was 2.6% for all the patients. Two of the 98 procedures in the high-risk group were complicated with ipsilateral stroke (2.0%) as compared with six of the 317 low-risk procedures (1.9%; P = 1). Six procedures were complicated with cardiac dysfunction after surgery, including myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or the new onset of atrial fibrillation. Three cardiac complications occurred in the low-risk group (1%), and three occurred in the high-risk group (3.1%; P =.15).",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was the presentation of the results of iliac venous stent placement in the management of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).\nBalloon dilation and stent placement for the relief of iliac vein stenoses was performed in 304 limbs with symptomatic CVI. Sixty-one limbs had concomitant saphenous vein ablation. The median age was 52 years (range, 14 to 83 years). The ratio of postthrombotic to nonthrombotic CVI was 1 to 0.9. The CEAP classification clinical scores were: C(2), 24; C(3), 158; C(4), 60; C(5), 13; and C(6), 49. Associated reflux was present in 57% of the limbs. The procedure was performed on an outpatient basis. Intravascular ultrasound scanning was routinely performed because transfemoral venography had poor sensitivity for the detection of iliac vein stenosis.\nThe actuarial primary and secondary stent patency rates at 24 months were 71% and 90%, respectively. The median degree of swelling (graded 0 to 3, for none, pitting, ankle edema, to gross leg edema) declined from grade 2 to grade 1 after surgery (P <.001). The limbs without any swelling increased from 12% before stenting to 47% after stenting (P <.01). The pain level recorded on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10 declined from a median level of 4 to 0 after stent placement (P <.001). The limbs that were completely free of pain increased from 17% before stenting to 71% after stent placement (P <.001). Stasis dermatitis/ulceration was present in 69 limbs. The improvement in swelling and pain was similar in ulcerated and nonulcerated limbs. The cumulative recurrence-free ulcer healing rate was 62% at 24 months. The rate of ulcer healing was similar whether or not concomitant saphenous ablation was performed. Quality of life has significantly improved.\nThe correction of iliac vein outflow obstruction with the placement of stents results in the significant relief of major symptoms of CVI. The procedure is minimally invasive, can be performed on an outpatient basis, has minimal complications with a high patency rate, and does not preclude subsequent open surgery for the correction of restenosis or the associated reflux. If these preliminary results are sustained for a long-term period, stent placement for the correction of iliac vein stenoses may represent a useful advance in the management of CVI.",

Although he attended a standard 2-day training course conducted by the instrument manufacturer, performed several similar procedures in the animal laboratory, and read all the recent pertinent literature, technical errors resulted in significant morbidity in his first two patients. He proposes to use the technique once again on a hospitalized patient. His troubled chairman has called you for an opinion on whether an ethical question has now arisen. There are no specific credentialling standards for robotic surgery at this institution. Where might we most expect to see an ethical problem in the surgeon's management of the new case?",

    "abstract": "This was a dose-finding and effectiveness study of a newly developed contrast-enhancing agent, sulphur hexafluoride (SF(6)), in patients with peripheral arterial disease in whom the therapeutic policy could not be established on the basis of standard color-flow duplex scanning of the leg arteries.\nIn this open-label, randomized, dose-ranging, crossover design, 14 patients in whom the assessment of vessel patency was difficult because of poor visibility (low-flow state) or extensive wall calcifications were studied. Contrast-enhanced duplex scanning was performed on the upper leg (n = 4), lower leg (n = 6), or pedal (n = 4) arteries after intravenous injection of four different dosages of SF(6). The results were compared with those from selective angiography of the vessel of interest. Contrast duration and agreement about the diagnosis and the confidence in the diagnosis were obtained before and after administration of the contrast agent.\nNo adverse effects of the contrast agent were seen. Overall agreement was reasonable with regard to vessel patency between contrast-enhanced duplex scanning and angiography (71%). Nine of 14 vessels (64%) appeared open when contrast was applied. In four cases this could not be confirmed by angiography; in two of these cases this was due to the presence of collateral vessels. All vessels that appeared occluded with the contrast agent were also occluded on the angiogram. The confidence in the diagnosis increased from 56% to 91% after contrast administration (P <.0001).\nSF(6)-enhanced color-flow duplex scanning is a safe method that may improve the assessment of the patency of leg arteries, particularly in low-flow states. The visualization of collateral vessles during (enhanced) duplex scanning may be misleading because they may be regarded as the vessel of interest.",

    "abstract": "Primary palmar hyperhidrosis is a condition marked by excessive perspiration and is reported to have an incidence of 1% in the Western population. It is a potentially disabling disorder that interferes with social, psychological, and professional activities. Over the past several years, several investigators have reported a positive family history in their patients treated for hyperhidrosis. To date, the cause is unknown; furthermore, epidemiologic data are scarce and inadequate.\nTo characterize the genetic contribution to hyperhidrosis, we conducted a prospective study of 58 consecutive patients with palmar, plantar, or axillary hyperhidrosis treated with thoracoscopic sympathectomy from September 1993 to July 1999. Forty-nine of the 58 probands volunteered family history data for these analyses (84% response rate). A standardized questionnaire was administered during the postoperative visit or by phone interview, and a detailed family history was obtained. The same questionnaire was also administered to a set of 20 control patients. The familial aggregation of hyperhidrosis has been quantified by estimating the recurrence risks to the offspring, parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins of 49 probands and 20 controls. We estimated the penetrance by use of a genetic analysis program.\nThirty-two of 49 (65%) reported a positive family history in our hyperhidrosis group, and 0% reported a positive family history in our control group. A recurrence risk of 0.28 in the offspring of probands compared with frequency of 0.01 in the general population provides strong evidence for vertical transmission of this disorder in pedigrees and is further supported by the 0.14 risk to the parents of the probands. The results indicate that the disease allele is present in about 5% of the population and that one or two copies of the allele will result in hyperhidrosis 25% of the time, whereas the normal allele will result in hyperhidrosis less than 1% of the time.\nWe conclude that primary palmar hyperhidrosis is a hereditary disorder, with variable penetrance and no proof of sex-linked transmission. However, this does not exclude other possible causes, and we anticipate that genetic confirmation of this disorder may lead to earlier diagnoses and advances in medical and psychosocial interventions.",

    "abstract": "To determine the incidence, risk factors, and associated morbidity of transient advanced mental impairment (TAMI) after aortic surgery.\nWe retrospectively studied the charts of 188 consecutive patients undergoing elective aortic reconstruction during a recent 6-year period at a university hospital. All patients were lucid on admission and nonintubated at the time of evaluation at least 2 days after operation. TAMI was defined as disorientation or confusion on 2 or more postoperative days. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative clinical variables were examined statistically for associations with TAMI.\nFifty-three patients (28%) had development of TAMI 3.9 plus minus 2.8 days after operation. Stepwise logistic regression analysis selected the following independent predictors for TAMI: age >65 years (odds ratio [OR], 7.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7 to 23.7), American Society of Anesthesiology physical status classification >3 (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3 to 5.9), diabetes mellitus (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 9.8), old myocardial infarction (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 5.3), and hypertension (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.0 to 5.3). Alcohol consumption was not significantly associated with TAMI. In the postoperative period, patients with TAMI were more likely to have hypoxia (P <.001), a need for reintubation (P <.001), pneumonia (P <.001), congestive heart failure (P =.003), and kidney failure (P =.05). In addition, patients with TAMI had a longer duration of endotracheal intubation (3.7 plus minus 7.8 vs 0.6 plus minus 1.2 days, P <.001), stay in the intensive care unit (8.9 plus minus 9 vs 3.9 plus minus 2 days, P <.001), and postoperative hospital stay (14.8 plus minus 11 vs 9.2 plus minus 5 days, P <.001) than patients without TAMI. Twenty (38%) patients with TAMI were discharged to intermediate-care facilities, compared with 11 (8%) patients without TAMI (P <.001). Postoperative variables conferring the largest relative risks for development of TAMI included oxygen saturation less than 92% (5.4), the need for reintubation (3.3), congestive heart failure (3.3), and pneumonia (3.2). TAMI, conversely, conferred the largest relative risks for development of postoperative congestive heart failure (15.3), the need for reintubation (9.3), pneumonia (7.1), and the need for ICU readmission (3.8).\nThese data show that TAMI is prevalent among patients undergoing aortic reconstruction and is associated with dramatically increased morbidity and postoperative hospitalization rates.",

    "abstract": "Overexpression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) is an important means of cell protection during physiologic stress such as occurs during atherogenesis. Immune responses are early events in atherosclerosis, with recent studies indicating that both humoral and cellular autoimmune processes in atherogenesis are directed toward HSPs. Dendritic cells are the key cells in the initiation and regulation of immune responses. This study examined whether HSP70 is overexpressed by dendritic cells in atherosclerotic lesions.\nTwenty-six carotid artery and 16 aortic specimens obtained at endarterectomy and aortic reconstruction were examined with immunohistochemical techniques. The nature of cells that overexpressed HSP70 was studied in consecutive sections that were double stained with antibodies to HSP70 and cell type-specific markers, including CD1a and fascin (to identify dendritic cells), CD14 (monocytes), CD68 (macrophages), CD3 (T cells), CD15 (mast cells), von Willibrand factor (endothelial cells), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (smooth muscle cells). Staining with HLA-DR and CD1d was used to identify cells involved in antigen presentation.\nIn advanced atherosclerotic lesions, several cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and smooth muscle cells, overexpressed HSP70. In contrast, in early atherosclerotic lesions, only dendritic cells overexpressed HSP70. Dendritic cells that overexpressed HSP70 frequently contacted T cells and also expressed HLA-DR. Furthermore, dendritic cells that clustered with T cells expressed CD1d, a unique molecule responsible for presenting lipid antigens.\nThe results suggest that direct contacts between activated dendritic cells that overexpress HSP70 and T cells might be responsible for T cell activation and might facilitate the presentation of lipid antigens to T cells directly within the arterial wall. In early intimal lesions, HSP70 is overexpressed exclusively by dendritic cells, which suggests that dendritic cells might be involved in the early phases of atherogenesis.",

    "abstract": "This investigation was designed to determine whether differences in vasoreactivity occur in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) as compared with patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) or individuals (controls) without known vascular disease.\nBrachial artery vasoreactivity was assessed in a blinded fashion, after endothelium-dependent (ED) and endothelium-independent (EI) flow-mediated vasodilation, in age-matched, male patients with AAAs (n = 11) or PAOD (n = 9) or in controls (n = 10). There were no significant differences in prestudy systolic or diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, or antilipidemic medications among the groups studied. Exclusion criteria included diabetes and tobacco use within 3 months. Quantitative ultrasound scan measurements of brachial artery diameters were performed at rest and after either forearm ischemia (ED) or administration of 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin (EI). Plasma nitric oxide (NO(X) = NO(2) + NO(3)) was measured with the Saville assay. Asymmetric dimethylarginine, an endogenous inhibitor of NO(X) synthase, was measured with liquid chromatography.\nInitial brachial artery diameters were not significantly different among the groups studied (4.85 +/- 0.18 mm for AAA group, 4.82 +/- 0.17 mm for PAOD group, 4.68 +/- 0.20 mm for controls). ED and EI vasodilation was significantly less (P =.02 and.03, respectively) in the AAA group (-1.71 +/- 1.52 and 8.33 +/- 1.13, respectively) when compared with the controls (2.96 +/- 1.04 and 13.88 +/- 2.16, respectively). However, plasma NO(X) was significantly increased (P =.01) in the AAA group (7.86 +/- 0.85 micromol/L) as compared with both controls (5.13 +/- 0.63 micromol/L) and PAOD (4.85 +/- 0.46 micromol/L). Asymmetric dimethylarginine levels were decreased in the AAA group (0.34 +/- 0.05 micromol/L) as compared with the PAOD group (0.46 +/- 0.09 micromol/L). No correlation existed between aneurysm size and ED or EI vasodilation or plasma NO(X).\nThis study is the first to document a divergence between ED and EI vasoreactivity and systemic NO metabolites in patients with AAAs. It is speculated that a dysfunctional vessel wall response, rather than a lack of NO, may be important in the pathogenesis of AAAs.",

    "abstract": "The use of the saphenous vein in coronary artery bypass graft surgery is associated with high 1-year occlusion rates of as much as 30%. A new \"no-touch\" technique of saphenous vein harvesting in which the vein is harvested with a pedicle of surrounding tissue and not distended may result in improved early patency rates. We hypothesize that nitric oxide synthase is better preserved with the no-touch technique, and the aim of this study was the investigation of whether nitric oxide synthase distribution and quantity in saphenous veins harvested with the no-touch technique differ from those veins harvested with the conventional technique. The separate contribution of perivascular tissue removal and distension to alterations in nitric oxide synthase was also studied.\nSegments of 10 saphenous veins were harvested from 10 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting surgery with the no-touch and conventional techniques. Samples were also taken from segments that were stripped of surrounding tissue but not distended. Nitric oxide synthase distribution was studied with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate--diaphorase histochemistry, and staining was quantified with image analysis. Immunohistochemistry was used for the identification of specific nitric oxide synthase isoforms, and immunomarkers were used for the identification of associated cell types.\nNitric oxide synthase content was higher in no-touch vessels as compared with conventionally harvested vessels (35.5%; P <.05, with analysis of variance). This content was associated with endothelial nitric oxide synthase on the lumen while all three isoforms were present in the media. In the intact adventitia of no-touch vessels, all three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase were also present, associated with microvessels and perivascular nerves. Perivascular tissue stripping and venous distension both contribute to the reduced nitric oxide synthase in conventionally harvested veins.\nThe new no-touch technique of saphenous vein harvesting preserves nitric oxide synthase, which suggests that improved nitric oxide availability may be an important mechanism in the success of this technique.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation and atherosclerosis are present in both abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and arterial occlusive disease (AOD). Changes in gene expression that underlie the development of AAA versus AOD are poorly defined. This study evaluated differences in gene expression in AAA, AOD, and control aortic tissue with human gene array technology.\nRNA was isolated from human aortic specimens (seven AAA, five AOD, and five control), and complementary DNA (cDNA) probes were generated. The cDNA probes were hybridized to a human cell interaction array of 265 genes and quantitated with phosphorimaging. The data were corrected for background and were standardized to housekeeping genes. Statistical differences in individual gene expression were determined with the Kruskal-Wallis test.\nOf 265 genes studied, 11 showed statistically different expression in diseased aorta as compared with control. The following three genes were downregulated in AAA: collagen VI alpha1 (P <.037), glycoprotein IIIA (P <.006), and alpha2-macroglobulin (P <.020). The following two genes were upregulated in AOD: laminin alpha4 (P <.034) and insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (P <.049). The following three genes were upregulated in both AAA and AOD: matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9; P <.005), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (P <.012), and tumor necrosis factor--beta receptor (P <.022). The following three genes were downregulated in both AAA and AOD: integrin alpha5 (P <.012), ephrin A5 (P <.037), and rho/rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (P <.028). Of 16 MMPs evaluated, only MMP-9 was significantly (P <.005) upregulated in both AAA and AOD. Evaluation results of four tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases showed no significant difference in expression for all tissue types, although tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 trended toward upregulation in AAA (P =.053). Eight of the fifteen most highly expressed genes in all the groups were extracellular matrix or secreted proteins. Of these, only collagen VI alpha1 (P <.037) showed a significant change, although biglycan trended toward downregulation in AAA (P =.076).\nThis study used cDNA array technology in the comparison of human control and pathologic aortic tissue. Six genes had similar differential expression in both AAA and AOD as compared with control. Even more interesting were differences between AAA and AOD in the expression of five genes.

    "abstract": "We report on a modified duplex scanning technique that may be a means of detecting a patent internal carotid artery (ICA) previously believed to be occluded by means of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), standard duplex protocols, or both. In addition, we attempted to develop selection criteria for operability in this setting, on the basis of the lumen diameter and wall thickness of the post-stenotic ICA segment.\nIn the past 22 months, 17 patients (12 men; 5 women) with ICA occlusions reported by means of MRA (10 patients) or by means of duplex scanning (7 patients) were found to have patent arteries when subjected to this duplex scanning protocol: (1) the use of low pulse repetition frequency (150-350 Hz), maximal persistence, and sensitivity of color and power angiography modes; (2) the use of an 8-MHz to 5-MHz probe as a means of visualizing the most distal extracranial segment of the ICA; and (3) measurements of the lumen diameter and wall thickness of the post-stenotic ICA. The age of patients ranged from 53 to 80 years (mean age, 71 years). Seven patients (41%) had no symptoms.\nExtremely low peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities were detected distal to the stenotic segment in the ICA in all cases, and they varied from 5 to 30 cm/s (mean, 14 plus minus 8 cm/s) and 0 to 8 cm/s (mean, 4.5 plus minus 2.0 cm/s), respectively. The luminal diameter of the post-stenotic ICA varied from 0.7 to 3.6 mm (mean, 2.0 plus minus 1.1 mm), and the wall thickness ranged from 0.6 to 1.4 mm (mean, 0.9 plus minus 0.3 mm) in all patients. Twelve patients (71%) were examined with the intent of performing an endarterectomy. Of these, eight patients (47%) underwent successful operations with patches (3 vein; 5 synthetic), and four (29%) were found to have unreconstructable disease. The ICA lumen diameter and wall thickness in all eight patients who underwent endarterectomies were 2 mm or larger and 1 mm or thinner, respectively, whereas they were smaller than 2 mm and thicker than 1 mm, respectively, in the remaining four patients (P <.01). The last five patients were observed because they had small ICAs (lumen <2 mm) with thickened walls (>1 mm). Intraoperative and early postoperative duplex scanning examinations were performed in the eight ICAs that were successfully reconstructed. In these patients, the ICA lumen diameter increased from a mean of 2.9 plus minus 0.4 mm preoperatively to a mean of 4.4 plus minus 0.3 mm 2 weeks postoperatively (P <.001). Intraoperative ICA flow volumes were also measured after the endarterectomy, and they varied from 55 to 242 mL/min (mean, 115 plus minus 53 mL/min) and ranged from 122 to 220 mL/min (mean, 159 plus minus 34 mL/min) 2 weeks postoperatively. One patient who did not undergo surgical exploration died of chronic renal failure and congestive heart failure within the first month of follow-up. The remaining 16 patients had no neurological symptoms and were alive after a follow-up period of 2 to 22 months (mean, 8 plus minus 5 months).\nThe proposed duplex protocol appears to be an effective means of identifying some patients with patent ICAs that were believed to be occluded by means of standard examinations. In addition, such patients may be candidates for an endarterectomy if the ICA post-stenotic lumen diameter is 2 mm or larger and the wall thickness is 1 mm or thinner.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to define differences in perioperative hemodynamics and associated outcomes in patients who undergo carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with regional and general anesthesia.\nAll the patients who underwent CEA during a 25-month period were reviewed, with a comparison of those who underwent operation with cervical block anesthesia (CB) with those who underwent operation with general anesthetic (GA). Baseline intraoperative and postoperative blood pressure and heart rate were recorded, and deviation from initial values was calculated. The administration of vasoactive medications was assessed. Operative time, intensive care unit admission, postoperative length of stay, and cardiac/neurologic morbidity were recorded.\nFrom October 16, 1998, to December 1, 2000, 550 nonemergent CEAs were performed in 527 patients (226 with CB and 324 with GA). The patients in both groups were similar in age, presentation, and associated comorbidities. Although baseline blood pressure and heart rates were similar in both groups, those patients who underwent operation with GA had significantly greater intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic variability and received more vasoactive medications during surgery (87% versus 51%; P <.001) and in the recovery room (36% versus 21%; P =.0009). Major postoperative blood pressure derangements were more common in the GA group (18% versus 10%; P <.05). Patients who underwent operation with GA more frequently needed intensive care unit admission (16% versus 7%; P =.01) and had more frequent delays in discharge (20% versus 11%; P =.008; postoperative length of stay, 2.1 versus 1.6 days; P =.01). Although no difference was seen in neurologic morbidity rates between groups (combined major stroke/death rate, 1.8%), the major cardiac morbidity rate was noted to be lower in the CB group (1% versus 4%; P =.05). The total in-room time was shorter in the CB group (108 versus 122 minutes; P <.001).\nCEA performed with CB is associated with significantly less perioperative hemodynamic instability than with GA. This results in fewer major adverse cardiac events. Ultimately, decreased critical care resource use is realized as is a shortened length of stay.",

The patients in both groups were similar in age, presentation, and associated comorbidities. Although baseline blood pressure and heart rates were similar in both groups, those patients who underwent operation with GA had significantly greater intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic variability and received more vasoactive medications during surgery (87% versus 51%; P <.001) and in the recovery room (36% versus 21%; P =.0009). Major postoperative blood pressure derangements were more common in the GA group (18% versus 10%; P <.05). Patients who underwent operation with GA more frequently needed intensive care unit admission (16% versus 7%; P =.01) and had more frequent delays in discharge (20% versus 11%; P =.008; postoperative length of stay, 2.1 versus 1.6 days; P =.01). Although no difference was seen in neurologic morbidity rates between groups (combined major stroke/death rate, 1.8%), the major cardiac morbidity rate was noted to be lower in the CB group (1% versus 4%; P =.05). The total in-room time was shorter in the CB group (108 versus 122 minutes; P <.001).",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was the determination of whether the choice of either autogenous saphenous vein (ASV) or synthetic material for patch angioplasty significantly influences the results after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).\nWith Institutional Review Board approval, 195 patients (145 men and 50 women; mean age, 69 years) who underwent 207 CEAs were prospectively randomized to arteriotomy closure with ASV or synthetic patches from July 1996 to January 2000. One hundred and one patients (52%) were randomized to the ASV cohort, and 94 (48%) were randomized to the synthetic cohort. Aside from a slight gender imbalance (70% versus 79% male in the ASV versus the synthetic group), there were no clinically important differences in baseline demographic variables, risk factors, or surgical indications between the ASV and synthetic groups.\nWith all 207 randomized procedures on an intent-to-treat basis, there were two early (<30 days) postoperative deaths (1%). There were three perioperative strokes in the ASV cohort (3.0%) and two in the synthetic cohort (2.1%; P =.99). Two of these early strokes occurred in a subset of nine patients who received neither patch material, all after randomization but before CEA. Two patients in each group had late strokes. The cumulative freedom from stroke rate at 1 year (ASV, 94%; synthetic, 95%) was virtually identical for both cohorts. With the 125 patients who had at least one postoperative duplex scan, the incidence rate of recurrent (>or=60%) carotid stenosis was 4.8% (three of 62) for the ASV group and 6.3% (four of 63) for the synthetic group (P =.99).\nNo significant differences in the stroke, mortality, or restenosis rates were shown between the ASV and the synthetic cohorts. While conceding the power limitations inherent in this study, we conclude that CEA may be safely performed with similar early results with ASV or synthetic patches.",

    "abstract": "Underdeployment of an intravascular stent has been identified as a cause of restenosis or occlusion of a treated arterial lesion. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has been shown to initially improve the anatomic and clinical stenting. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of IVUS increased long-term patency of this intervention.\nBetween March 1992 and October 1995, 71 limbs (52 patients) with symptomatic aortoiliac occlusive disease underwent balloon angioplasty with primary stenting. IVUS and arteriography were used in 49 limbs (36 patients) to evaluate stent deployment. Arteriography alone was used in 22 limbs (16 patients) to evaluate stent deployment. Patients were captured prospectively in a vascular registry and retrospectively reviewed.\nMean age of patients treated with IVUS was 61.1 plus minus 9.0 years (range, 38-85) versus 70.0 plus minus 10.1 years (range, 57-87) in patients treated without IVUS (P <.01). There was no difference between the groups with respect to preoperative comorbidities, ankle-brachial indices, or number of stents per limb. Mean follow-up for IVUS patients was 62.1 plus minus 7.3 months (range, 15-81) and 57.9 plus minus 8.7 months (range, 8-80) for patients treated without IVUS (P = not significant). In 40% (20/49) of limbs, IVUS demonstrated inadequate stent deployment at the time of the original procedure. Kaplan-Meier 3- and 6-year primary patency estimates were 100% and 100% in the IVUS group and 82% and 69%, respectively, in limbs treated without IVUS (P <.001). There have been no secondary procedures performed in limbs treated with IVUS and a 23% (5/22) secondary intervention rate in the non-IVUS group (P <.05). Overall Kaplan-Meier survival estimates at 3 and 6 years for all patients were 84% and 67%, respectively.\nBalloon angioplasty and primary stenting of symptomatic aortoiliac occlusive lesions is a durable treatment option. Long-term follow-up of treated patients shows outcomes that are comparable with direct surgical intervention.

None of these studies have compared the results of lysis/PTA versus thrombectomy/open patch repair for failed above-knee polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) FPGs.\nPatients with failed (thrombosed) above-knee FPGs (PTFE, Goretex) during a 10-year period were given the option to choose between thrombectomy/open patch repair for localized anastomotic short stenosis (less-than-or-equal2 cm; group A, 31 patients) and lysis/PTA or thrombectomy/balloon angioplasty when lysis failed or was contraindicated (group B, 26 patients). The cumulative patency rates were compared by using a Kaplan-Meier life table analysis. All patients underwent routine color duplex ultrasound scanning/ankle brachial index measurements at 30 days, 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter.\nDemographic and clinical characteristics and indications for intervention were comparable in both groups. The mean follow-up period was 54.1 and 46.2 months in group A and group B, respectively. There were four perioperative complications in group A (13%) and seven perioperative complications in group B (27%). Initial technical success and 30-day secondary graft patency rates were 100% in both groups. Overall, 17 of 31 patients (55%) had open grafts, with no further revisions in group A and six of 26 patients (23%) in group B requiring further revisions (P =.012). Nine of 31 grafts (29%) failed in group A versus 15 of 26 grafts (58%) in group B (P =.027). The rate of limb loss was comparable in both groups (6% vs 12%). The overall cumulative secondary patency rates at 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years were 100%, 93%, 85%, 72%, 67%, and 62% for group A and 100%, 96%, 88%, 76%, 63%, and 45% for group B (P =.035). Thirty-five further interventions were needed to maintain graft patency in group B (mean, 1.35; range, 0-3) versus five further interventions in group A (mean, 0.16; range, 0-1; P <.05).\nThrombectomy/open surgical repair is superior to lysis/PTA (or thrombectomy/balloon angioplasty) for the treatment of failed above-knee PTFE FPGs with anastomotic stenoses. Therefore, balloon angioplasty should be reserved for patients who are at high risk for surgery.",

When this option is not available, two of the remaining options are prosthetic bypass graft or several segments of vein spliced together. In this study, we compare spliced vein bypass grafting versus polytetrafluoroethylene grafting with a distal vein cuff in patients with limb-threatening ischemia.\nBetween 1996 and 2000, 39 bypass grafting procedures in 36 patients were performed for limb-threatening ischemia. These procedures were prospectively randomized to either spliced vein bypass grafting (spliced group, 19 bypass grafts) or polytetrafluoroethylene grafting with a distal vein cuff (cuff group, 20 bypass grafts). All the patients in the cuff group underwent anticoagulation therapy with warfarin sodium after surgery. The inclusion criteria included: no single-piece vein option for bypass grafting, adequate vein for splice, no composite sequential option, and limb-threatening ischemia. The demographics were similar between the two groups.\nThe primary patency rate at 2 years was 44% and 49% for the spliced and cuff groups, respectively. In the spliced group, seven of 19 bypass grafts underwent revision in the follow-up period, and two of 20 cuffed bypass grafts were successfully revised. The secondary patency rate was 87% and 59% (P <.05), with limb salvage rates of 94% and 85% for spliced and cuff groups, respectively. Four patients in the spliced vein group needed reoperation for wound complications related to vein harvest. One polytetrafluoroethylene graft needed removal for infection. Two early mortalities occurred in the spliced group, one from myocardial infarction and one from stroke. The overall survival rate at 2 years between the two groups was 67% and 100% for the spliced and cuff groups, respectively (P <.05).\nAlthough this is a preliminary report, it appears that both spliced vein bypass grafting and polytetrafluoroethylene bypass grafting with a distal vein cuff produce acceptable limb salvage rates.

    "abstract": "A recent retrospective study showed that the ischemic consequences of femoropopliteal bypass graft occlusion were more severe with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) than with vein. This study examines this conclusion and whether oral anticoagulation therapy reduces the degree of ischemia after occlusion of PTFE and vein femoropopliteal bypass grafts.\nFour hundred two patients who underwent femoropopliteal bypass grafting (233 PTFE and 169 vein) were randomized to a postoperative regimen of either warfarin (international normalized ratio, 1.4 to 2.8) and aspirin (WASA; 325 mg daily) therapy or aspirin alone (ASA) therapy. The grade of acute ischemia at the time of graft occlusion was assessed with the Society of Vascular Surgery recommended reporting standards (I, viable; II, threatened). Early graft occlusions (<30 days) were excluded.\nThere were 100 graft occlusions (67 PTFE and 33 vein) during a mean follow-up period of 36 months (PTFE) and 39 months (vein). Forty-eight patients were randomized to WASA therapy, and 52 were randomized to ASA therapy. The patients were well matched for age, atherosclerotic risk factors, operative indication, and preoperative ankle-brachial index. Overall, a greater percentage of the PTFE occlusions caused grade II ischemia than did the vein graft occlusions (48% versus 18%; P =.005). The ankle-brachial index at the time of graft occlusion was significantly lower in the PTFE grafts than in the vein grafts (0.28 versus 0.45; P =.001). The patients with PTFE who were undergoing WASA therapy at the time of graft occlusion had less grade II ischemia than did those patients who were undergoing ASA therapy (28% versus 55%; P =.057). However, the incidence rate of severe ischemia after graft occlusion remained greater with PTFE grafts and WASA therapy as compared with all the vein grafts (28% versus 18%). The vein graft occlusions had the same incidence rate of grade II ischemia with WASA therapy as with ASA therapy (20% versus 17%; P = 1.0).\nThe ischemic consequences of femoropopliteal bypass graft occlusion are worse with PTFE than with vein. Treatment with WASA therapy lessens the severity of acute ischemia after the occlusion of PTFE graft as compared with ASA therapy but not to the degree seen with vein graft occlusion. Occlusion of femoropopliteal vein grafts is seldom accompanied by severe ischemia and is not improved with WASA therapy.",

There were no procedure-related deaths or septic complications. Technical complications occurred in 12 patients (4%). Filter misplacement occurred in 6 patients (2%), access thrombosis in 1 (<1%), migration in 1 (<1%), bleeding in 1 (<1%), and IVC occlusion in 3 (1%).

    "abstract": "Recanalization is common after acute deep venous thrombosis, but the factors that contribute to its variable extent are unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between recanalization and plasma markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis.\nSubjects with an ultrasound-confirmed deep venous thrombosis had prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F 1+2), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) activity, and t-PA antigen levels determined before anticoagulation therapy. Ultrasound and plasma studies were repeated at 14 days, 1 month, and every 3 months for 1 year.\nAmong 71 enrolled subjects, F 1+2 levels normalized within 14 days. The mean t-PA activity was within the normal range at all follow-up intervals. However, the mean t-PA antigen (10.7 plus minus 10.5 to 13.6 plus minus 13.5 ng/mL; P =.04) and PAI-1 (9.0 plus minus 8.1 to 13.2 plus minus 17.3 U/mL; P =.05) levels increased between the time of presentation and day 14. The mean reduction in thrombus score among 44 patients who completed 9 months of follow-up was 60.9% (plus minus 42.1%). Percent recanalization was directly associated with initial t-PA activity levels (R =.4; P =.006) and inversely related to F 1+2 (R = minus sign. 5; P =.004), t-PA antigen (R = minus sign.5, P =.002), and PAI-1 (r = minus sign. 5, P =.001) levels. However, only initial F 1+2 (P =.0009) and t-PA antigen (P =.004) levels were independent predictors of the degree of recanalization.\nAlthough the mechanisms by which the venous lumen is restored are still being elucidated, recanalization is inversely related to levels of activated coagulation (F 1+2) and fibrinolytic inhibition (t-PA antigen) at the time of presentation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was the assessment of the efficacy of thoracoscopic cervicodorsal and open lumbar sympathectomy for the reduction of pain severity and disability associated with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD).\nFrom 1992 to 2000, 73 patients with RSD underwent 46 video-assisted thoracoscopic (first to fourth thoracic ganglion) or 37 surgical lumbar (first to fourth lumbar ganglion) sympathetic chain resections. The patients were referred from multidisciplinary pain clinics with documented sympathetically maintained pain syndrome on the basis of reproducible more than 50% reduction in pain severity score (0, no pain; 10, most severe pain imaginable) for more than 2 days after sympathetic block therapy. The mean duration of the RSD symptoms before sympathectomy was 26 plus minus 14 months (range, 6 to 100 months). Postoperative pain severity score, limb disability, and overall patient satisfaction were assessed by an independent third-party observer at a mean follow-up period of 30 months.\nNo operative mortality or serious morbidity (Horner's syndrome, bleeding that needed transfusion, wound infection) occurred. Transient (<3-month) postprocedural sympathalgia developed in one third of the patients for cervicodorsal sympathectomy and 20% of the patients for lumbar sympathectomy and was treated effectively with trigger point/proximal ganglion block therapy or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. At 3 months after sympathectomy, 10% of the patients had conditions that were judged treatment failures with no reduction in pain severity or limb disability. The remaining patients testified to more than 50% pain reduction, with pain severity scores decreasing from a mean of 8.7 before surgery to 3.4 after sympathectomy. At 1 year, one quarter of the patients had continued significant pain relief (pain severity score, <3) and an additional 50% of the patients indicated continued but reduced pain severity and an increase in daily/work activities. Overall, patient satisfaction (willingness to have procedure again, benefit from sympathectomy) was 77% and was not significantly influenced by patient age, RSD duration/stage, or extremity involvement (lumbar, 84%; cervicodorsal, 72%).\nPatients with RSD with a confirmed sympathetically maintained pain syndrome can realize long-term benefit from surgical sympathectomy. Procedural efficacy was similar for both upper limb and lower limb RSD syndromes, although the level of pain reduction did deteriorate with time.

    "abstract": "Spinal cord arteriography (SCA) often has been considered difficult, hazardous, and unreliable. In this report, we question these assumptions.\nFrom August 1985 to June 2000, a total of 480 patients underwent 487 SCA procedures during diagnostic examination for 498 aneurysms, which included 159 that involved the descending thoracic aorta and 339 that involved the thoracoabdominal aorta. The underlying cause was degenerative disease in 288 cases, chronic dissection in 132 cases, and other causes in 78 cases.\nMajor procedure-related complications occurred in six patients (1.2%) and included spinal cord complications in two patients, renal complications in two patients, and stroke in two patients. Puncture-site complications occurred in three patients (0.6%). Rupture of the aneurysm occurred within 3 days after SCA in two patients (0.4%). Two deaths (0.4%) were directly imputable to SCA. In 476 patients (97.7%), SCA was devoid of major complications. The Adamkiewicz's artery was successfully located in 419 patients (86.0%) and arose from a left intercostal or lumbar artery in 323 patients (77.1%) and from between T8 and L1 levels in 361 patients (86.2%). On the basis of the extent of identification of spinal cord vasculature, the procedure was considered as a complete success in 321 patients (65.9%), as a partial success in 112 patients (23.0%), and as a failure in 54 patients (11.1%). Although the failure rates were comparable, the complete success rate was significantly higher in patients with degenerative rather than dissecting aneurysms (P <.001) and in patients with limited aneurysms (ie, types 1, 2, and 3 versus type 4 descending thoracic aneurysms, P <.05; and types 3 and 4 versus types 1 and 2 thoracoabdominal aneurysms, P <.001).\nSCA is a safe adjunct that warrants more widespread use in the management of descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Chronic inflammation is a characteristic feature of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), but the molecular signals responsible for recruiting monocytes into the outer aortic wall are unresolved. The purpose of this study was to examine whether AAA tissues elaborate chemotactic activity for mononuclear phagocytes and to determine whether this activity is attributable to interactions between elastin degradation peptides (EDPs) and their cell surface receptor, the 67-kD elastin binding protein (EBP).\nSoluble proteins were extracted from human AAA tissues, and chemotactic activity for differentiated U937 mononuclear phagocytes was measured by use of a modified Boyden chamber. Chemotactic activity induced by N -formyl-Met-Leu-Phe was used as a positive control and checkerboard analysis was used to distinguish chemotaxis from chemokinesis. Inhibition of chemotaxis was tested by peptide competition, blocking antibodies and galactosugar-mediated dissociation of the 67-kD EBP.\nAAA extracts stimulated a concentration-dependent increase in monocyte migration that reached up to 24% of the maximal effect induced by N -formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. Checkerboard analysis demonstrated that AAA extracts stimulated chemotaxis without a chemokinetic effect. AAA-derived chemotactic activity was eliminated by competition with Val-Gly-Val-Arg-Pro-Gly (VGVAPG), a repetitive peptide found in human elastin that binds to cellular elastin receptors, and decreased nearly 40% in the presence of BA-4, an antielastin monoclonal antibody that can block EDP-mediated chemotactic activity. Monocyte chemotaxis in response to both VGVAPG and AAA extracts was abolished in the presence of lactose, a galactosugar that specifically dissociates the 67-kD EBP, but it was unaffected by either glucose, fructose, or mannose.\nThese findings indicate that soluble EDPs released within human AAA tissue can subsequently attract mononuclear phagocytes through ligand-receptor interactions with the 67-kD EBP, thereby providing a plausible molecular mechanism to explain the inflammatory response that accompanies aneurysmal degeneration. Better understanding of factors regulating inflammatory cell recruitment may lead to novel forms of therapy for early stages of aneurysmal degeneration.",

    "abstract": "This review describes the clinical outcome of surgical intervention for atherosclerotic renovascular disease in 500 consecutive patients with hypertension.\nFrom January 1987 to December 1999, 626 patients underwent operative renal artery (RA) repair at our center. A subgroup of 500 patients (254 women and 246 men; mean age, 65 plus minus 9 years) with hypertension (mean blood pressure, 200 plus minus 35/104 plus minus 21 mm Hg) and atherosclerotic RA disease forms the basis of this report. Hypertension response was determined from preoperative and postoperative blood pressure measurements and medication requirements. Change in renal function was determined with estimated glomerular filtration rates (EGFRs) calculated from serum creatinine levels. Proportional hazards regression models were used for the examination of associations between selected preoperative parameters, blood pressure and renal function response, and eventual dialysis-dependence or death.\nTwo hundred three patients underwent unilateral RA procedures, 297 underwent bilateral RA procedures, and 205 patients underwent combined renal and aortic reconstruction. After surgery, there were 23 deaths (4.6%) in the hospital or within 30 days of surgery. Significant and independent predictors of perioperative death included advanced age (P <.0001; hazard ratio [HR], 3.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85 to 5.70) and clinical congestive heart failure (P =.013; HR, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.26 to 7.34). Among the patients who survived surgery, hypertension was considered cured in 12%, improved in 73%, and unchanged in 15%. For the entire group, renal function increased significantly after operation (preoperative versus postoperative mean EGFR, 41.1 plus minus 23.9 versus 48.2 plus minus 25.5 mL/min/m(2); P <.0001). For individual patients, with a 20% or more change in EGFR considered significant, 43% had improved renal function (including 28 patients who were removed from dialysis-dependence), 47% had unchanged function, and 10% had worsened function. Preoperative renal insufficiency (P <.001; HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.86 to 2.98), diabetes mellitus (P =.007; HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.15 to 3.97), prior stroke (P =.042; HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.22), and severe aortic occlusive disease (P =.003; HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.19 to 2.31) showed significant and independent associations with death or dialysis during the follow-up examination period. After operation, blood pressure cured (P =.014; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.88) and improved renal function (P =.011; HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.81) showed significant and independent associations with improved dialysis-free survival rate. All categories of function response and time to death or dialysis showed significant interactions with preoperative EGFR.\nThe surgical correction of atherosclerotic renovascular disease resulted in blood pressure benefit and retrieval of renal function in selected patients with hypertension. The patients with cured hypertension or improved EGFR after operation showed increased dialysis-free survival as compared with other patients who underwent surgery.",

    "abstract": "Device migration (DM) has been shown to cause late failure after endoluminal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. To establish the incidence rate and the predictive factors of distal migration of the proximal portion of the endograft, computed tomographic (CT) scans performed at different time intervals during follow-up examination of 113 patients were reviewed.\nBetween April 1997 and March 1999, 148 patients underwent endoluminal AAA repair with a modular endograft with infrarenal fixation (Medtronic-AVE AneuRx, Santa Rosa, Calif) at our unit. CT scans performed at 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery and yearly thereafter were prospectively stored in a computer imaging database. Patient demographics, risk factors, operative details, and follow-up events were prospectively collected. No patients were lost to follow-up examination. Twelve patients died within 2 years of surgery, four patients underwent immediate conversion to open repair, and adequate CT measurements were not feasible in 19 cases, which left 113 patients available for a minimum 2-year assessment and 418 CT scan results reviewed. Two vascular surgeons, blinded to patient identity and history with tested interobserver agreement (kappa = 0.64), separately reviewed axial reconstructions of CT scans. DM was defined as changes of 10 mm or more in the distance between the lower renal artery and the first visible portion of the endograft at follow-up examination. Ten possible independent predictors of DM were analyzed with multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model.\nOne AAA rupture, which was successfully treated, occurred at a mean follow-up period of 28 months (range, 24 to 46 months). Seventeen patients (15%) showed DM. Eight patients (47%) with DM underwent reintervention: a proximal cuff was positioned in six patients and late conversion to open repair was performed in two patients. Of the 10 variables analyzed with Cox proportional hazards regression model, AAA neck enlargement of more than 10% after endoluminal repair (hazard ratio, 7.3; confidence interval, 1.8 to 29.2; P =.004) and preoperative AAA diameter of 55 mm or more (hazard ratio, 4.5; confidence interval, 1.2 to 16.7; P =.02) were positive independent predictors of DM. The probability of DM at 36 months was 27% according to life table analysis.\nDM occurred in a significant portion of our patients, yet aggressive follow-up examination and a high reintervention rate prevented aneurysm-related death. According to our data, dilatation of the infrarenal aortic neck is an important factor that contributes to the distal migration of stent grafts, and patients with large aneurysms are at high risk for DM.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is reported to result in less initial patient morbidity and a shorter hospital length of stay (LOS) when compared with conventional AAA repair. We sought to examine the durability of this result during the intermediate follow-up interval.\nThe records of all admissions for all patients who underwent AAA repair during a 26-month interval were reviewed.\nThree hundred thirty-seven (337) patients underwent procedures to repair AAAs (163 open and 174 endovascular). Endovascular procedures were performed with a variety of devices (Talent, 108; Ancure, 36; AneuRx, 26; Zenith, 2; and Cordis, 2) and configurations (141 bifurcated and 33 aortomonoiliac). The mean follow-up period was 10.6 months (endovascular repair) and 12.3 months (open repair). LOS did not significantly vary by device (P =.24 to P =.92) or configuration (P =.24). The initial median LOS for procedures was significantly shorter (P =.009) for endovascular repairs (5 days) than for open procedures (8 days). However, the patients who underwent endovascular repair were more likely to be readmitted during the follow-up interval when compared with patients who underwent open procedure. The readmission-free survival rate after AAA repair at 12 months was 95% for patients for open AAA repair versus 71% for patients for endovascular repair (P <.001). If the total hospital days were compared, including the initial and all subsequent AAA-related admissions, there was no significant difference for mean LOS for patients who underwent endovascular versus open AAA procedures (11 days versus 13.6 days; P =.21). The patients for endovascular AAA repair most commonly needed readmission for treatment of endoleak (n = 31), wound infection (n = 12), and graft limb thrombosis (n = 9). Although women had similar LOS to men for endovascular repair (P =.44), they had longer initial LOS for open AAA repair (15 versus 10 days; P =.03). After endovascular repair, women were more likely than men to be readmitted by 12 months (51% versus 71% readmission-free survival rate; P =.03) and they had longer LOS on readmission (13.2 versus 5.2 days; P =.006). No gender differences were identified for patients after open AAA repair regarding readmission-free survival rate (P =.09) or LOS on readmission (P =.98).\nAlthough initial LOS was shorter for the patients who underwent endovascular as compared with conventional AAA repair, this advantage was lost during the follow-up interval because of frequent readmission for the treatment of procedure-related complications, chiefly endoleak. These readmissions frequently involved the performance of additional invasive procedures. Gender differences existed regarding LOS and the likelihood of complications after open and endovascular AAA repair.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EAR) can be performed in patients whose conditions were previously considered unfit for conventional treatment of the aneurysm. However, because the life span in this category of patients often is limited because of serious comorbidity, the efficacy of EAR in prolonging life expectancy remains uncertain. This study involves the evaluation of preoperative risk classification and an assessment of the outcome of interventions.\nThe data of 3075 patients, who underwent operation in 101 European institutions that collaborated in the EUROSTAR Registry, were assessed. Only the patients who had been prospectively enrolled in the registry were used for this analysis. Patient characteristics, operative risk factors, procedural details, and types of devices were correlated with preoperative estimates of operative risk, early and late mortality, complications, and primary and secondary outcome success rates. In addition, the intermediate-term survival rates in patients with unfit conditions with EAR (observed series) and with conservative approaches of the aneurysms (rupture rates as derived from the literature) were compared in a mathematical model.\nOf the overall study group, 2525 patients were at \"normal\" risk for a surgical procedure (group A), 399 patients had conditions that were considered unfit for open surgery (group B), and 151 patients had conditions that were unfit for general anesthesia (group C). Both unfit categories had significantly more comorbid factors and larger aneurysms than did the patients in good medical condition. Differences were observed in comorbidities between the two high-risk categories, groups B and C. Factors that influenced the abdominal approach (previous laparotomies, hostile abdomen, and obesity) and local anatomic factors (eg, retroperitoneal fibrosis, inflammatory aneurysm, dissections, and enterostomy) were present in 19% of the patients with conditions that were unfit for open surgery and in only 1% of the category unfit for anesthesia. In contrast, severe pulmonary disease was present in 33% of the patients with conditions that were unfit for anesthesia as opposed to 11% of the patients with conditions that were unfit for open surgery. The early and late mortality rates were significantly higher in the unfit categories (groups B and C). Life table results showed a 3-year survival rate of 83% in patients at normal operative risk and of 68% in patients with unfit conditions (P =.0001). An independent correlation with late death was shown for the clinical classification into high-risk groups B and C, pulmonary disease, team experience of less than 60 procedures, and the diameter of the aneurysm. In groups B and C, aneurysms smaller than 6.0 cm were associated with a 2-year survival rate of 80% and larger aneurysms with a rate of 68% (P =.02). This difference was caused by an increased non-aneurysm-related mortality rate in the group with aneurysms of more than 6 cm. The mathematical model showed an advantage of EAR with regard to the reduction of the death rate in patients with unfit conditions as compared with no intervention after 1 year. The advantage of EAR was observed in patients with AAAs between 5 and 6 cm and with larger aneurysms.\nEarly and late mortality rates were increased in patients with the preoperative clinical diagnosis \"unfit for open surgery and general anesthesia\" as compared with patients at \"normal\" operative risk. EAR appeared of potential benefit in patients with unfit conditions, regardless of the aneurysm diameter. The life expectancy of patients at high risk who are considered for EAR should be longer than 1 year before any realistic gain in life span can be anticipated.",

    "abstract": "Late complications and graft failures have recently cast serious doubts on the durability of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). The results of a multicenter trial comparing a bifurcated endograft (AB) with standard open repair (OR) were reviewed to assess the late findings of both methods of AAA treatment.\nIn a multicenter study of AB versus OR conducted from December 1995 to February 1998, 242 patients with AAA successfully treated with an AB and 111 control patients treated concurrently with OR were followed up at least yearly. Twenty-five immediate conversions were excluded from late follow-up. All imaging modalities obtained during follow-up were reviewed by a core laboratory for AAA size, endoleaks, migration, and device integrity. Clinical outcomes at the yearly visits were compared. All death reports were reviewed to classify the cause of death.\nAverage follow-up for the AB group was 36 months, with 194 patients at 3 years and 55 patients at 4 years. The cumulative mortality rate was similar between the AB (15.7%) and OR groups (12.6%; P =.59). The significant early benefit to the AB group in cardiopulmonary complications was no longer evident by 3 years. However, the AB advantage in total and bowel complications, as well as the higher renal complication rates, persisted. At 3 years, 73.7% of patients showed a significant reduction of their AAA size, whereas 25.7% still had an endoleak. One migration and two single hook fractures were noted. Graftrelated reinterventions were performed in 50 patients (20%) without any deaths. Twenty-eight patients (11.6%) underwent interventions for limb flow compromise, whereas 25 were treated for endoleak. Late conversion to OR was required in five patients (2%). No AAA ruptures were encountered in either group.\nRupture-free survival rates after treatment of AAA with the bifurcated AB are similar to those of the OR group. Notably the proximal attachment system is relatively stable and the AAA shrinks in three of four patients treated. Reinterventions are nonetheless required in nearly one of five patients. Although most late procedures are percutaneous, counseling regarding possible future interventions is necessary.",

Sham-operated rabbits without aortic occlusion were used as controls with epidural infusion at healthy body temperature (39 degrees C; n = 3). Motor function was assessed at 48 hours with Tarlov's criteria, and the animals were killed. The spinal cord was sectioned into multiple segments, and semiquantitative histologic scoring (0 to 5) was used to grade ischemic injury.\nCooling solution and spinal cord temperatures showed linear correlation (r = 0.95). All the rabbits in groups 1 (except one with mild weakness), 2, and 3 were neurologically intact, and all in group 4 had paraplegia develop (P < .001). One rabbit in group 1 died from increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Mean blood pressure, ICP, and body temperature were similar among the groups. Histology correlated with the clinical findings. In groups 1 and 2, minimal histologic changes were noted. Low-grade ischemic changes were present in group 3 in the low-lumbar and mid-lumbar segments. Severe ischemic injury occurred at the same segments in group 4 (P < .05).\nThese study results suggest that in rabbits satisfactory spinal cord protection during aortic occlusion can be achieved at moderate regional hypothermia (24 degrees C).

    "abstract": "The goal of the Lifeline Endovascular Registry is to provide a minimal, yet comprehensive, data set of patient follow-up that can evaluate the long-term safety of endovascular grafts used in abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.\nFollow-up data have been collected on 1757 patients for this first report, including 1646 endovascular graft recipients and 111 surgical patients receiving treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nLogistic regression of 1-year survival indicates that the factors most likely to decrease 1-year survival for the surgical group are renal failure and larger aneurysm size. For the endovascular graft recipients, the presence of renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, larger aneurysm size, and increased age demonstrates a decrease in 1-year survival. Approximately 80% (1309) of the endovascular recipients have been followed for 1 year. Of these 1309 patients, 17% (222) have incurred an endoleak, and enlargement of the aneurysm has occurred in 4.6% (60). There was a total of 80 (4.9%) endovascular graft recipients converted to surgery. The most prevalent factors causing conversion to surgery were an increase in aneurysm diameter, aneurysm rupture, and the presence of a proximal endoleak.\nAlthough the data collected by the Registry thus far are limited, we anticipate rapid expansion of the Registry to include data from other manufacturers and investigators. Nevertheless, early data analysis does demonstrate the importance of surveillance of endovascular graft recipients. Through the collection and analysis of Registry data, adverse events continue to be captured, enabling the monitoring of long-term safety of endovascular grafts and the evaluation of graft performance. Data on comorbidities and postoperative factors, collected and evaluated for their effect on survival of the graft recipients, also provide information on optimal patient selection and management. We expect that the next report will support and expand on these findings, providing continuing evidence of the value of a national endovascular registry.",

    "abstract": "The incidence rate of treated end-stage renal disease in the united states is 180 per million and continues to rise at a rate of 7.8% per year. Arteriovenous hemodialysis access (AV access) creation and maintenance are two of the most difficult issues associated with the management of patients on hemodialysis. The 1-year complication rate of a primary prosthetic AV access for hemodialysis ranges from 33% to 99%. Various investigators report on patency and complications of AV access. However, it is rather difficult to compare outcomes because of the wide variety of access materials, configurations, locations, risk factors, and quality of inflow and outflow vessels. Although there have been reporting standards for dialysis access endovascular interventions and for central venous access placement, standards regarding surgical access placement and its revision are lacking. The \"Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative,\" published by the National Kidney Foundation, provides recommendations for optimal clinical practices aimed at improving dialysis outcome and patient survival. This reporting standards document is not meant to be a \"practice guidelines\" or \"best practices\" document. Rather, the purpose of this document is to provide standardized definitions related to AV access procedures and to recommend reporting standards for patency and complications, to be used by surgeons, nephrologists, and interventional radiologists, that will permit meaningful comparisons among AV access procedures. The terms, definitions, and categories featured in this article have been approved by the Committee on Reporting Standards of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Association for Vascular Surgery and should be observed in preparing manuscripts on AV accesses for submission to the Journal Of Vascular Surgery.",

Of 26 BVVs placed into the jugular veins, 25 exhibited good valve function on immediate venography and 22 on venograms obtained before the sheep were killed. Gross and histologic examination results demonstrated incorporation of remodeled and endothelialized SIS BVVs into the vein wall. Slight to moderate leaflet thickening was found mostly at their bases. Percutaneously placed SIS BVV is a promising one-way, competent valve that resists venous back-pressure while allowing forward flow.",

    "abstract": "Blunt trauma from bicycle handlebars is associated with well-described injuries of the abdominal viscera. These injuries result from the forceful compression of the relatively immobile abdominal organs between the handlebar end and the vertebral bodies. The common femoral artery is also immobile as it passes anterior to the superior pubic ramus, rendering this vessel susceptible to a similar mechanism of injury. We have treated two children who sustained thrombosis of the common femoral artery caused by bicycle handlebar trauma. The lack of familiarity with this uncommon mode of injury may contribute to delayed diagnosis and increased morbidity. We therefore wish to draw attention to this mechanism of injury.",

    "abstract": "Although aortic endograft iliac limb occlusion is an uncommon event, its treatment is problematic because standard surgical thrombectomy risks graft dislodgment or component separation. Although femorofemoral bypass grafting can restore perfusion to the affected limb, its longevity may be inferior to reestablishing patency of the endograft itself and represents a failure of the endograft procedure. With aortic endografts now commercially available, implanting surgeons must be aware of this important complication and well versed in all of the endovascular treatment options. We report three cases of endoluminal management of unilateral iliac limb occlusion of bifurcated aortic endografts.",

We describe a patient who underwent implantation of a bifurcated stent graft 5.5 cm below the renal arteries because of a technical error with three extender cuffs implanted proximally to bridge the gap. During the 1st year, aneurysm diameter decreased from 68 to 52 mm. After 1 year, the patient had an acute endoleak develop, which originated between two of the extender cuffs and which was accompanied by severe abdominal pain and reexpansion of the aneurysm. This endoleak was treated with insertion of an additional bifurcated stent graft within the extender cuff segment. The patient has been subsequently followed for 6 months and has had no endoleak or symptoms, and aortic diameter has decreased once again to 55 mm.",

The case was complicated by persistent bacteremia and a delay in diagnosis before it was managed successfully with an autogenous replacement graft and appropriate antibiotics. Overt stent infection is exceedingly rare, but according to the literature describing transfemoral coronary artery intervention, the spectrum of clinical syndromes related to infection of the arterial puncture site includes local invasion, pseudoaneurysm formation, septic embolization to the distal limb, and bacteremia. The diagnosis requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and is often delayed. Although the incidence of infectious complications reported for percutaneous intra-arterial interventions historically has been low, the absolute number of these complications almost certainly will increase in the future because of the expanding array of interventional procedures that is becoming available.",

    "abstract": "We present the first case of in situ replacement of an infected subclavian artery using superficial femoral vein and the fourth reported case of an infected arterial pseudoaneurysm caused by pseudomonas pseudomallei. Sepsis and hoarseness developed in a 58-year-old man after recent travel to Borneo, Indonesia. Indirect laryngoscopy revealed a paralyzed right vocal cord. Computed tomography and arteriography revealed a 6.5-cm pseudoaneurysm of the proximal right subclavian artery. Blood cultures grew pseudomonas pseudomallei. An abnormal cardiac stress test prompted a coronary angiography, which revealed severe coronary artery disease.The patient underwent coronary artery bypass and in situ replacement of the infected subclavian artery pseudoaneurysm with a superficial femoral vein, along with placement of a pectoralis major muscle flap to cover the vein graft. Operative cultures of the pseudoaneurysm grew pseudomonas pseudomallei. The patient was treated with a 6-week course of intravenous ceftazidime and oral doxycycline and then continued on oral amoxicillin-clavulanate. One week after discontinuing intravenous antibiotics, the patient presented to the emergency department with a rapidly expanding, pulsatile mass in the right supraclavicular space. He was taken emergently to the operating room. After hypothermic circulatory arrest was accomplished, the disrupted vein graft and aneurysm cavity were resected and the subclavian artery was oversewn proximally and distally. Parenteral ceftazidime was continued for 3 months and oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (augmentin) was continued indefinitely. There was no evidence of infection clinically or by computed tomographic scan 2 years later. Although autogenous vein replacement of infected arteries and grafts may be successful in the majority of cases, this strategy should probably be avoided when particularly virulent bacteria such as the organism in this case are present.",

    "abstract": "The increased synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is thought to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), but the functional regulation and the activation states of these MMPs remain unclear. In this study, we assessed the expression levels and the functional regulation of several MMPs in the pathogenesis of AAAs.\nHuman healthy aorta and AAA specimens were homogenized, and the proteolytic activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and of the macrophage metalloelastase (MMP-12) were assessed with zymography. Protein expression of MMP-1, MMP-12, membrane-type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP), tissue inhibitor of MMP 1 (TIMP-1), TIMP-2, TIMP-3, alpha-actin, and beta-actin was analyzed with electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and immunoblotting.\nMMP-1, MMP-9, and MMP-12 zymogen levels and proteolytic activities were increased in AAAs when compared with healthy aorta. A severe reduction in alpha-actin--positive vascular SMCs was observed in all the AAA specimens and was correlated with an increase in TIMP-3 but not TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 potential activities. Although pro--MMP-2 activity was decreased, the extent of activated MMP-2 remained unaffected in the AAAs. In accordance with this result, a highly activated MT1-MMP form was also observed in AAAs.\nThese data suggest that chronic aortic wall inflammation is mediated by macrophage infiltration, which may account for the destruction of medial elastin, as reflected by SMC down regulation, through increased levels of active MMP-1 and MMP-12. Moreover, altered MT1-MMP proteolytic turnover and differential regulation of TIMP expression in AAAs suggest that tight regulatory mechanisms are involved in the molecular regulation of MMP activation processes in the pathogenesis of AAAs.",

Moreover, altered MT1-MMP proteolytic turnover and differential regulation of TIMP expression in AAAs suggest that tight regulatory mechanisms are involved in the molecular regulation of MMP activation processes in the pathogenesis of AAAs.",

    "abstract": "Angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessels, has become an area of increased interest for both scientific and clinical application purposes. Proangiogenic agents, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and naltrexone, have been shown to effectively induce new blood vessel growth. Other growth factors, such as the endogenous opioid growth factor (OGF; [Met(5)]-enkephalin) and retinoic acid, are inhibitors of angiogenesis. The differential effects on veins and arteries, however, by any vascular growth factor, have not previously been investigated.\nThe chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay was used for the in vivo quantitation of angiogenesis. After 3 days of incubation, fertilized chick embryos were explanted, and a 3.2-mm methylcellulose disk containing either the known angiogenic stimulators VEGF (0.2 microg, 1.0 microg) or naltrexone (0.1 microg, 5.0 microg), or the angiogenic inhibitors OGF (1.0 microg, 5.0 microg) or retinoic acid (1.0 microg) was placed onto the CAM surface. An equal volume of distilled water served as a control. After 2 days of growth, the CAM arteries and veins were identified, and images were obtained with a digital camera. Quantitative analysis of angiogenesis was performed on a 100-mm(2) area surrounding the applied disk, and the number and length of the veins and arteries were measured.\nThe angiogenic stimulators VEGF and naltrexone markedly increased both the total number and length of all blood vessels as compared with control values. The mean length of blood vessels decreased, suggesting the induction of new vessel growth. VEGF and naltrexone proportionately increased vein and arterial angiogenesis, maintaining artery/vein ratios for vessel number and length that were unchanged compared with controls. The angiogenic inhibitors, OGF and retinoic acid, notably decreased the total number and length of blood vessels in the CAM preparations. However, these compounds had a disproportionately greater inhibitory effect on arterial angiogenesis as reflected in decreased artery/vein ratios for vessel number and length.\nThe angiogenic stimulators VEGF and naltrexone induce development of veins and arteries in a proportional manner. In contrast, the angiogenic inhibitors OGF and retinoic acid demonstrated a greater inhibitory effect on arterial as compared with venous angiogenesis. Such differential effects on angiogenesis may be important in both defining mechanisms of action and designing therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was the identification of the optimal settings of ultrasound scan flow measurement in the veins and the determination of whether the standardization of these settings can provide acceptable reproducibility of the venous flow measurements in individual segments of the lower extremity veins.\nThe venous cross-sectional area, the time average mean velocity, and the venous volume flow of 25 healthy volunteers were examined with duplex ultrasound scanning. Reproducibility was examined with different measurement settings. Doppler scan sample volume size, ultrasound scan beam incident angle, and time interval of measurement were varied across a spectrum for arrival at the setting for highest reproducibility of the flow volume measurements. Test-retest reproducibility of venous flow volume measurements then was investigated with optimized settings.\nThe highest repeatability of volume flow measurements was achieved when the full lumen of the vein was insonated (coefficient of repeatability [CR] = 1.88 cm/s), the ultrasound scan beam incident angle was equal to 60 degrees (CR = 1.56 cm/s), and the measurement time was more than 40 seconds (CR = 1.64 cm/s). The mean values of volume flow were 360 mL/min in the common femoral vein, 147 mL/min in the superficial femoral vein, 86 mL/min in the profunda femoral vein, and 38 mL/min in the greater saphenous vein. Test-retest repeatability coefficients were 96.9 mL/min for the common femoral vein, 70.2 mL/min for the superficial femoral vein, 40.8 mL/min for the profunda femoral vein, and 16.8 mL/min for the greater saphenous vein.\nThe reproducibility of ultrasound scan measurements of volume flow in veins is optimized with the use of sampling volumes that cover the entire venous lumen, with an incident angle of 60 degrees and measuring for 40-second intervals or longer. With these defined variables, volumetric measurements are sufficiently repeatable. the values of flow volume measured with duplex ultrasound scanning were comparable to those with thermodilution techniques that were reported previously.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was the analysis of the rapid changes in the size and shape of the peripheral vein and the associated changes in blood flow velocities and the estimation of their effect on the reliability of the ultrasound scan volume flow (VF) measurements.\nTen patients with primary chronic venous insufficiency and 10 healthy volunteers were studied. Two duplex scanners were used simultaneously: one for the velocity measurements in longitudinal plane and another for the cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements in transverse plane during quiet respiration, Valsalva's maneuver (VM), pneumatic cuff compression-decompression, and active dorsiflexion. The patients underwent examination in standing and 15-degrees reverse Trendelenburg's (RT) positions. VF was calculated on the basis of real-time CSA and velocity values.\nRapid changes in the CSA as much as 130% for 0.2 seconds were observed. In most cases, the changes in CSA and the flow velocity were inversely related, which resulted in near constant VF. With the exception of VM in the RT position, the difference between real-time VF and mean VF was not significant (P >.05). In the RT position, significant changes in CSA were observed during and immediately after VM. These changes resulted in 23% +/- 15% changes in outflow (both groups) and in 24% +/- 13% changes in reflux (chronic venous insufficiency group).\nThe CSA of the peripheral vein and the flow velocities undergo rapid changes during time intervals of a fraction of a second. The vein can have a noncircular cross-section. To minimize the potential error, VF measurements should be performed during quiet respiration or with cuff compression-decompression. With these conditions, the rapid changes in velocities and CSA do not significantly affect the accuracy of VF measurements because of their inverse relation. CSA should be measured planimetrically, or the site of the measurements should be where the vein is close to a circular shape.",

    "abstract": "This study presents our current results with duplex scanning-guided thrombin injection (DGTI) for the treatment of lower-extremity iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms (PAs). These results were compared with the results from our patient population that was treated with duplex scanning-guided compression (DGC).\nThis was a prospective evaluation of an institutional review board-approved protocol for ultrasound scanning-guided thrombin injection for the treatment of iatrogenic lower-extremity PAs. The maneuver was performed with continuous real-time color ultrasound scanning imaging to guide a needle into a PA sac. Then 0.5 to 1.0 mL of a thrombin solution (1000 U/mL) was injected, and thrombosis of the sac was monitored. All patients underwent an arterial evaluation of the involved extremity before and after thrombin injection. In addition, the size of the PA and its parent artery were documented by means of pre-injection imaging. After thrombosis of the PA, the patient was kept on bed rest for 4 hours, and activity was limited that day (bathroom privileges for inpatients). Follow-up imaging was performed after 24 hours, and attempts were made to obtain imaging 1 week and 1 month after injection.\nIn the 31 months of the study, 131 iatrogenic PAs of the lower extremity were initially treated with DGTI, and thrombosis was achieved in 126 of these cases (96%). Thrombosis of the PA sac was accomplished within seconds of thrombin injection. Five cases failed, three of which resulted from complications of the procedures, with two intra-arterial thrombin injections and one PA rupture after thrombosis.\nOur experience indicates that DGTI is more effective than DGC (96% vs 75%) in the treatment of iatrogenic lower-extremity PAs. The DGTI procedure is completed in minutes, compared with a mean compression time of 44 minutes with DGC, which leads to increased patient and operator acceptance. Intra-arterial thrombin injection was seen in 4% of PAs that were 2.6 cm or smaller and resulted in limb-threatening ischemia requiring surgical intervention. Finally, the use of a biopsy guide attached to the ultrasound scanning transducer head simplifies the visualization of the needle, reducing the number of needle punctures and needle manipulation.",

All patients who underwent amputation after treatment were analyzed separately. Data on deceased patients were extracted from the cause-of-death register.\nWomen had lower survival rates than men at 30 days and 1 and 5 years after operation (89% vs 92%, 75% vs 80%, and 50% vs 55%; P <.001). In the multivariate analysis of risk factors for death during the whole study period, increasing age, calendar year (1980 to 1989), and male sex were significant risk factors (P <.001). The percentage of women who underwent amputation after treatment was comparable with the percentage of men who underwent amputation (11.4% vs 10.2%, P =.075). The multivariate analysis identified increased age and calendar year (1985 to 1994) as important risk factors for amputation (P <.001). Female sex was not found to increase the risk for amputation. Patients who underwent amputation were older than patients with intact limbs (73 vs 68 years, P <.001). The highest percentage of patients who underwent amputation was found among those treated with femorodistal bypass (20%, P =.001).\nFemale sex is not an important risk factor for poor outcome after treatment for lower limb ischemia, when their increased age has been accounted for. These results imply that we should continue to consider age and type of procedure when estimating outcome, and women should not be refused an intervention on a sex-related basis. We should possibly be more selective toward men considering their higher mortality rates.",

    "abstract": "The potential effects of age at onset of smoking on cardiovascular diseases have been studied little, in contrast to the well-established evidence supporting a causal role of cigarette smoking in these diseases. We sought to analyze the relationship between age at smoking onset and development of symptomatic peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD).\nA population-based sample of 573 active or former male smokers aged 55 to 74 years were studied. Present or previous symptomatic PAOD was confirmed by noninvasive testing.\nSixty-one subjects (10.6%) had symptomatic PAOD. Prevalence of disease increased with earlier starting age (15.6% if <or=16 years versus 5.4% if >16 years) of smoking. After controlling for risk factors that meet confounding factor criteria (ie, subject age and number of pack-years), men who started smoking at age 16 or earlier had a substantially higher risk for development of PAOD (odds ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.15-4.15; P =.016) than men who began to smoke at a later age.\nA starting age for smoking of 16 years or earlier more than doubles the risk of future symptomatic PAOD regardless of the amount of exposure to cigarette smoking.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was the examination of the effect of successful large vessel revascularization on the microcirculation of the neuroischemic diabetic foot.\nWe measured the cutaneous microvascular reactivity in the foot in 13 patients with diabetes with peripheral arterial disease and neuropathy (group DI) before and 4 to 6 weeks after successful lower extremity arterial revascularization. We also compared them with age-matched and sex-matched groups of 15 patients with diabetes and neuropathy, seven patients without neuropathy, and 12 healthy patients for control. We used single-point and laser Doppler scan imaging for the measurement of the foot skin vasodilatation in response to heating to 44 degrees C and to iontophoresis of 1% acetylcholine (endothelial-dependent response) and 1% sodium nitroprusside (endothelial-independent response).\nThe group DI response to heat increased from 289% +/- 90% before surgery (percent increase over baseline measured in volts) to 427% +/- 61% (P <.05) after surgery but was still comparable with the response of the patients with diabetes and neuropathy (318% +/- 51%) and lower than the responses of the patients without neuropathy (766% +/- 220%) and the healthy patients for control (891% +/- 121%; P <.0001). The group DI acetylcholine response also improved from 6% +/- 4% before surgery to 26% +/- 8% after surgery (P <.05) and was similar to the responses of patients with diabetes and neuropathy (18% +/- 3%) and patients without neuropathy (38% +/- 8%) but still lower when compared with the response of the patients for control (48% +/- 9%; P <.001). The sodium nitroprusside response for group DI improved from 10% +/- 4% to 29% +/- 9% (P <.05) and was similar to the responses of the neuropathic (25% +/- 9%), nonneuropathic (32% plus minus 6%), and control (40% +/- 5%) groups. The group DI neurovascular response, which depends on the healthy function of the C-fiber nociceptors, was similar at baseline (5% +/- 9%) and after surgery (14% +/- %10) and in the neuropathic group (33% +/- 21%), but it was dramatically reduced when compared with the nonneuropathic (110% +/- 40%) and control (198% +/- 54%) groups (P <.001).\nImpaired vasodilation in the diabetic neuropathic lower extremity leads to functional ischemia, which improves considerably but is not completely corrected with successful bypass grafting surgery. Therefore, patients with diabetes and neuropathy may still be at high risk for the development of foot ulceration or the failure to have an existing ulcer heal despite adequate correction of large vessel blood flow.",

    "abstract": "We graded the severity of occlusive disease in foot vessels of patients with diabetes and correlated the scoring obtained with graft patency and limb salvage.\nIn this retrospective review of 199 limbs studied by means of angiography in 117 patients with diabetes mellitus, 124 limbs underwent bypass grafting. Each dorsalis pedis (DP), lateral plantar (LP), and medial plantar (MP) artery was assigned a score according to the reporting standards of the Joint Vascular Societies Council (0, no stenosis > 20%; 1, 21%-49% stenosis; 2, 50%-99% stenosis; 2.5, < half the vessel length occluded; 3, > half the vessel length occluded.) A foot score (DP + MP + LP + 1) was calculated for each foot (1 to 10). The mean follow-up period was 14 months.\nFor all 199 limbs and for the 124 limbs that underwent bypass grafting, the mean scores were similar for the DP, MP, and LP (1.8 +/- 1.0, 1.9 +/- 1.0, 1.9 +/- 1.0, respectively; P >.4). Only the MP and LP correlated with each other (r = 0.57; P <.0001). There were no scoring differences between limbs with symptoms and limbs that did not undergo bypass grafting. Bypass graft patency correlated with both the foot score and the MP score for tibial and inframalleolar grafts (P <.04). Patency correlated with the LP score only for inframalleolar bypass grafting procedures. The DP score alone did not differ between bypass grafts that remained patent and bypass grafts that failed. Bypass grafts in limbs with a foot score less than 7 and an MP score less than 2 had only a 2% failure rate. A foot score greater or equal to 7 was associated with a 30% failure rate for all bypass grafts (41% for inframalleolar grafts). Bypass grafts with low foot scores that failed did so much later than bypass grafts with high foot scores that failed (17 +/- 11 months vs 6 +/- 8 months; P <.02), possibly reflecting different etiologies for the failure. The limb salvage rate correlated with foot score (P <.05). The limbs that were saved had an average foot score of 6.4 +/- 2.0, versus 7.2 +/- 1.4 for limbs that required amputation.\nIn patients with diabetes mellitus, the foot score is a useful tool for predicting the likelihood of graft patency and limb salvage for infrapopliteal revascularization. However, the relatively high bypass success rate (70%) in the presence of a high foot score (>or= 7) does not allow its use in identifying the subgroup of patients who are unlikely to benefit from bypass grafting surgery. It cannot be used as a means of selecting patients for primary amputation.",

Preoperative intra-arterial thrombolysis may improve the outcome in this challenging situation. This study retrospectively analyzed a consecutive series of patients treated with preoperative thrombolysis and subsequent revascularization.\nThirteen patients with acute limb ischemia caused by thrombosis of a popliteal aneurysm underwent catheter-directed intra-arterial thrombolysis with urokinase and subsequent vascular reconstruction. The angiographic and clinical outcome was analyzed and compared with that in the literature.\nComplete aneurysm thrombosis with absence of runoff was documented in 12 cases. Thrombolysis restored perfusion with patency of the popliteal artery and a one- or two-vessel runoff in 77% of cases (10/13). Early cumulative graft patency and limb salvage rates were 68% and 83%, respectively, with an ankle/brachial index of 0.8 +/- 0.2. Lytic failure followed by attempts at bypass grafting was present in three patients (23%) and resulted in above-knee amputation. Severe rhabdomyolysis and fatal pulmonary embolism were responsible for a 15% early mortality rate.\nPreoperative thrombolysis followed by bypass grafting is a valid treatment option for patients who can withstand an additional period of ischemia that does not require immediate revascularization and intraoperative lysis.

    "abstract": "Significant aortic neck angulation may predispose to suboptimal outcome after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (EAAA) repair. However, the definition of \"significant\" neck angulation and its correlation with adverse outcome are poorly characterized.\nProspectively collected data on 148 consecutive EAAA repairs performed between December 1995 and January 2001 were supplemented with retrospective review of charts and radiographs. Aortic neck angulation was measured from arteriograms or three-dimensional computed tomography scanning reconstructions. Patients were excluded (n = 24) if radiographs were unavailable for review. Because of a paucity of severe aortic neck angulation in other endograft groups, only patients treated with a modular bifurcated device (Medtronic) (n = 81) were included in the final analysis. Mean time from implantation was 26.6 +/- 9.2 months.\nThe risk of a patient experiencing one or more adverse events was 70%, 54.5%, and 16.6% in those with severe (>or=60 degrees, n = 10), moderate (40 to 59 degrees, n = 11), and mild (<40 degrees, n = 60) aortic neck angulation, respectively (P =.0003). Adverse events included death within 30 days (20% vs 0%, P =.0007), acute conversion to open repair (20% vs 0%, P =.0007), aneurysm expansion (9.1% to 20% vs 1.7%, P =.034), device migration (20% to 30% vs 3.3%, P =.013), and type I endoleak (23.8% vs 8.3%, P =.033), all occurring with significantly greater incidence in patients with moderate or severe aortic neck angulation when compared with those with mild angulation, respectively. Aortic neck length and diameter, age, and medical comorbidities were not significantly different between groups.\nAortic neck angulation appears to be an important determinant of outcome after EAAA repair. Although patients with mild angulation (<40 degrees) had favorable outcomes in this series, those with moderate (40 to 59 degrees) or severe angulation (>or=60 degrees) had a 54% to 70% risk of one or more adverse events. Importantly, these outcomes occurred in spite of an adequate length (>2 cm) of proximal aortic neck. On the basis of these data, great caution should be exercised in recommending EAAA repair for patients with aortic neck angulation >or=40 degrees.",

    "conclusions": "Aortic neck angulation appears to be an important determinant of outcome after EAAA repair. Although patients with mild angulation (<40 degrees) had favorable outcomes in this series, those with moderate (40 to 59 degrees) or severe angulation (>or=60 degrees) had a 54% to 70% risk of one or more adverse events. Importantly, these outcomes occurred in spite of an adequate length (>2 cm) of proximal aortic neck. On the basis of these data, great caution should be exercised in recommending EAAA repair for patients with aortic neck angulation >or=40 degrees.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was the demonstration of the value of color duplex ultrasound (CDU) scanning in the detection of type I endoleak (T1EL) and type II endoleak (T2EL), the correlation of Doppler scan waveform pattern to endoleak persistence or seal, and the description of the natural history of endoleak.\nThe study was a retrospective review of 83 patients who underwent periodic CDU scan and computed tomographic (CT) scan surveillance of the endograft and aneurysm sac after insertion of an aortic endograft for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Forty-one patients (49%) with an endoleak at anytime in the follow-up period form the basis of this report.\nT1EL was detected in all five patients with CDU and CT scans. T2EL was detected in 36 patients with CDU scan as compared with 18 patients with CT scan. With CT scan, endoleak was not detected when CDU scan showed no endoleak. Conversely, all CT scan--detected endoleaks were found with CDU scanning. The T2EL source artery was identified with CT scan in seven patients, whereas the source was identified in all 36 patients with CDU scan. Endoleak source did not correlate with outcome (seal or persistence). However, a to/fro Doppler scan waveform pattern was associated with spontaneous T2EL seal in seven of 12 patients, and a monophasic or biphasic waveform was associated with endoleak persistence in 14 of 17 patients (P =.023, with chi(2) test). Thirteen of 36 T2ELs underwent spontaneous seal by 6.2 +/- 2.8 months. T2ELs without increasing AAA diameter were observed. Eight patients with persistent T2EL present for more than 12 months did not undergo treatment. However, two patients underwent T2EL obliteration with coils because of AAA sac enlargement. T1EL of the distal attachment site was the initial endoleak identified in five patients, but seven patients harboring T2ELs had subsequent T1ELs develop. For the entire 83 patients, the combined T1EL and T2EL prevalence rate was 20% of patients at a 6-month follow-up period, but this rate increased to 50% after 24 months. The incidence rate of newly detected endoleaks and of spontaneous sealing was 24.4% at 12 months and 12.5% in longer-term follow-up period.\nCDU scan is effective in the identification of the type of endoleak, the delineation of the vessel involved, and the hemodynamic information not available with any other testing method. Endoleaks have a dynamic natural history characterized by a variable onset with changing branch vessel involvement and spectral flow patterns. Periodic long-term endograft surveillance with CDU scanning is necessary for following existing endoleaks and for detecting new ones. Corroboration of these findings in larger multicenter prospective trials will be needed to determine whether CDU scan analysis of endoleaks would be predictive of long-term success in endovascular AAA repair.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence, risk factors, and consequences of endoleaks after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nData on 2463 patients were collected from 87 European centers and recorded in a central database. Preoperative data were compared for patients with collateral retrograde perfusion (type II) endoleak (group A), patients with device-related (type I and III) endoleaks (group B), and patients in whom no endoleak was detected (group C). Only endoleaks observed after the first postoperative month of follow-up were taken into consideration. Regression analysis was performed to investigate statistical relationships between the occurrence and type of endoleak and preoperative patient and morphologic characteristics, operative details, type of device, and experience of the operating team. In addition, postoperative changes in aneurysmal morphology, the need for secondary interventions, conversions to open repair, aneurysmal rupture, and mortality during follow-up were compared between these study groups.\nPatients in group A had a higher prevalence of a patent inferior mesenteric artery compared with patients without endoleak. Patients in group B were treated more frequently than patients in group C by an operating team with experience of less than 30 procedures. The mean follow-up period was 15.4 months. Secondary interventions were needed in 13% of the patients. Rupture of the aneurysm during follow-up occurred in 0.52% (1/191) in group A, 3.37% (10/297) in group B, and 0.25% (5/1975) in group C. Life table analysis comparing the three study groups demonstrated a significantly higher rate of rupture in group B than in group C (P =.002). The incidence of conversion to open repair during follow-up was higher in group B than in the other two study groups (P <.01). Death was related to the aneurysm or to endovascular repair of the aneurysm in 7% of patients. Secondary outcome success, defined as absence of rupture and conversion, was significantly higher in group A and C compared with that in group B (P =.006 and P =.0001, respectively).\nThe presence of device-related endoleaks correlated with a higher risk of aneurysmal rupture and conversion compared with patients without type I or III endoleaks. Type II endoleak was not associated more often with these events. Consequently, intervention in type II endoleak should only be performed in case of increase of aneurysm size.",

The 29 women (60%) and the 19 men (40%) had a mean age of 64 years (range, 40 to 87 years). The operative procedures consisted of bypass grafting in 36 arteries (AMI, 12; CMI, 24), local endarterectomy (LEA) in 16 arteries (AMI, 9; CMI 7), and transaortic endarterectomy (TAE) in 14 arteries (AMI, 4; CMI, 10). The follow-up of the 34 survivors was complete in all but four patients and averaged 5.3 years (range, 30 days to 36 years). Radiographic documentation of vessel/graft patency was obtained in 33 of 34 survivors.\nSingle-vessel revascularization was performed more frequently in the AMI group than in the CMI group (91% versus 48%; P =.001). The perioperative (<30 days) mortality rate in the AMI group was 52% (12 of 23 cases) as compared with 0 of 25 cases in the CMI group (P <.001). Bowel infarction was the cause of nine deaths. Major complications occurred in 60% of the cases. Fifteen late graft failures occurred, for a cumulative patency rate of 57% at 5 years and 46% at 10 years. TAE was associated with improved patency rates as compared with LEA (TAE versus LEA; P =.002). Symptomatic recurrences developed in eight patients, all involving superior mesenteric artery thrombosis (P <.001). The freedom-from-recurrence rates in the survivors were 79% at 5 years and 59% at 10 years. The late survival rates were 54% and 20% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. With the exclusion of perioperative deaths, the probability of long-term survival was 77% at 5 years and 29% at 10 years and did not differ between AMI and CMI.\nAlthough MAR for CMI carries a low mortality rate, AMI remains a lethal and frequently unheralded problem. Long-term patency and symptom-free survival can be expected after successful MAR for AMI and is comparable with those rates achieved after MAR for CMI. The patency of the SMA is important in the prevention of symptomatic recurrences. Elective MAR is indicated in patients with CMI and warrants long-term surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a morbid condition with a difficult diagnosis and a high rate of complications, which is associated with a high mortality rate. For the evaluation of the results of current management and the examination of factors associated with survival, we reviewed our experience.\nThe clinical data of all the patients who underwent operation for AMI between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1999, were retrospectively reviewed, clinical outcome was recorded, and factors associated with survival rate were analyzed.\nFifty-eight patients (22 men and 36 women; mean age, 67 years; age range, 35 to 96 years) underwent study. The cause of AMI was embolism in 16 patients (28%), thrombosis in 37 patients (64%), and nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NMI) in five patients (8.6%). Abdominal pain was the most frequent presenting symptom (95%). Twenty-five patients (43%) had previous symptoms of chronic mesenteric ischemia. All the patients underwent abdominal exploration, preceded with arteriography in 47 (81%) and with endovascular treatment in eight. Open mesenteric revascularization was performed in 43 patients (bypass grafting, n = 22; thromboembolectomy, n = 19; patch angioplasty, n = 11; endarterectomy, n = 5; reimplantation, n = 2). Thirty-one patients (53%) needed bowel resection at the first operation. Twenty-three patients underwent second-look procedures, 11 patients underwent bowel resections (repeat resection, n = 9), and three patients underwent exploration only. The 30-day mortality rate was 32%. The rate was 31% in patients with embolism, 32% in patients with thrombosis, and 80% in patients with NMI. Multiorgan failure (n = 18 patients) was the most frequent cause of death. The cumulative survival rates at 90 days, at 1 year, and at 3 years were 59%, 43%, and 32%, respectively, which was lower than the rate of a Midwestern white control population (P <.001). Six of the 16 late deaths (38%) occurred because of complications of mesenteric ischemia. Age less than 60 years (P <.003) and bowel resection (P =.03) were associated with improved survival rates.\nThe contemporary management of AMI with revascularization with open surgical techniques, resection of nonviable bowel, and liberal use of second-look procedures results in the early survival of two thirds of the patients with embolism and thrombosis. Older patients, those who did not undergo bowel resection, and those with NMI have the highest mortality rates. The long-term survival rate remains dismal. Timely revascularization in patients who are symptomatic with chronic mesenteric ischemia should be considered to decrease the high mortality rate of AMI.",

    "conclusions": "The contemporary management of AMI with revascularization with open surgical techniques, resection of nonviable bowel, and liberal use of second-look procedures results in the early survival of two thirds of the patients with embolism and thrombosis. Older patients, those who did not undergo bowel resection, and those with NMI have the highest mortality rates. The long-term survival rate remains dismal. Timely revascularization in patients who are symptomatic with chronic mesenteric ischemia should be considered to decrease the high mortality rate of AMI.",

    "results": "Fifty-eight patients (22 men and 36 women; mean age, 67 years; age range, 35 to 96 years) underwent study. The cause of AMI was embolism in 16 patients (28%), thrombosis in 37 patients (64%), and nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NMI) in five patients (8.6%). Abdominal pain was the most frequent presenting symptom (95%). Twenty-five patients (43%) had previous symptoms of chronic mesenteric ischemia. All the patients underwent abdominal exploration, preceded with arteriography in 47 (81%) and with endovascular treatment in eight. Open mesenteric revascularization was performed in 43 patients (bypass grafting, n = 22; thromboembolectomy, n = 19; patch angioplasty, n = 11; endarterectomy, n = 5; reimplantation, n = 2). Thirty-one patients (53%) needed bowel resection at the first operation. Twenty-three patients underwent second-look procedures, 11 patients underwent bowel resections (repeat resection, n = 9), and three patients underwent exploration only. The 30-day mortality rate was 32%. The rate was 31% in patients with embolism, 32% in patients with thrombosis, and 80% in patients with NMI. Multiorgan failure (n = 18 patients) was the most frequent cause of death. The cumulative survival rates at 90 days, at 1 year, and at 3 years were 59%, 43%, and 32%, respectively, which was lower than the rate of a Midwestern white control population (P <.001). Six of the 16 late deaths (38%) occurred because of complications of mesenteric ischemia. Age less than 60 years (P <.003) and bowel resection (P =.03) were associated with improved survival rates.",

    "abstract": "Intraoperative duplex scanning (IDS) after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been shown to reliably identify major defects either by significant changes in peak systolic velocities or by B-mode imaging. To evaluate whether IDS could also predict postoperative strokes in technically flawless CEAs, we analyzed several hemodynamic parameters and correlated them with patient outcome.\nFrom March 2000 to February 2001, 226 consecutive primary CEAs were performed in 208 patients (120 men). Of these, 153 lesions were asymptomatic. General anesthesia and synthetic carotid artery patches were used routinely. Intraluminal shunts were used when internal carotid artery (ICA) back-pressures were <50 mm Hg (35% of cases). IDS consisted of B-mode and color-flow imaging and spectral analyses of the common, external, and internal carotid arteries. Volume flows were measured three times, and the mean flow rate was used for this study.\nThe first set of data was analyzed when the twenty-ninth patient had the second immediate postoperative stroke. It was noted that the two patients who had postoperative strokes had mean ICA volume flows (MICAVF) of 48 mL/min and 85 mL/min. Only two additional patients had MICAVF <100 mL/min. The remaining 25 cases had MICAVF ranging from 102 to 299 mL/min, with a mean of 165 +/- 57 mL/min (+/-SD) (P <.02). Although there was a significant correlation between MICAVF and ICA peak systolic velocity (P <.01), the latter was not found to be a significant predictor of postoperative stroke. Moreover, end-diastolic velocities, resistive index, ICA diameter, and ICA back-pressure also did not correlate with neurologic events. These findings led us to change our protocol for patients with MICAVF <100 mL/min. This included a repeat set of volume flow measurements after 15 to 20 minutes, withholding the reversal of heparin, and the liberal use of completion arteriography. Of the following 197 CEAs, 26 (13%) were found to have MICAVF <100 mL/min (range 55 to 99 mL/min; mean 79 +/- 18 mL/min). Of these, five had arteriography that documented spasm of the intracranial portion of the ICA in four and a small-diameter ICA (<2 mm) in one. Except for the five cases, the remaining 21 cases had MICAVF >100 mL/min (range 105 to 158 mL/min, mean 127 +/- 20 mL/min [+/-SD]) on repeat study. Four patients with persistent ICA low flow (70 to 99 mL/min) were treated with postoperative anticoagulation. One of the last 197 patients had a stroke caused by hyperperfusion syndrome 2 weeks after operation. Overall, six of 226 cases (2.7%) required revision on the basis of abnormal B-mode imaging results or peak systolic velocities >150 cm/s. There were two common carotid artery flaps, two ICA stenoses, one ICA flap, and one localized thrombus. All six were successfully revised and had repeat normal IDS study results, and none of these patients had a postoperative stroke.\nIDS is helpful in identifying residual lesions or defects that may contribute to postoperative neurologic deficits. MICAVF <100 mL/min are suggestive of spasm that could lead to thrombus formation and stroke, particularly in the presence of synthetic patches. We suggest that heparin reversal should not be used unless ICA flow rates are >100 mL/min. ICA spasm is short lived in most patients undergoing CEA.",

    "abstract": "Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has been recommended by some authors for the management of postendarterectomy restenosis. However, some authors have expressed concern about the influence of primary closure and patch angioplasty performed during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on the incidence rate of complications after CAS.\nWe analyzed our consecutive series of 54 CAS procedures performed for restenosis after prior CEA. These procedures accounted for 75% of the 72 CAS procedures performed at our institution for all indications during the last 4 years. Of these 54 patients, 28 (52%) were men and 26 (48%) were women, with a mean age of 69 years. The mean clinical follow-up period was 18 months (range, 1 to 48 months). The mean interval between prior CEA and CAS was 16 months (range, 6 to 62 months). Nineteen patients were symptomatic (35%), and 35 were asymptomatic (65%). The mean severity of restenosis was 84% +/- 7% (standard deviation). The mean residual stenosis after CAS was 8% +/- 3% (standard deviation).\nAmong the 54 prior CEAs, eight cases were performed with primary closure (15%), five procedures used patch closure with autologous vein (9%), and 41 operations used Dacron patch closures (76%). All patients were managed successfully with CAS with predeployment angioplasty with low profile balloons, self-expanding stents, and poststent angioplasty to approximate the transverse diameter of the carotid artery. No instances of contrast extravasation, arterial disruption, or subintimal dissection were observed. One stroke (1.8%), a retinal infarction with partial field of vision loss, occurred in a patient with prior CEA and Dacron patch closure, and no deaths were observed in the series.\nPerformance of CAS for restenosis after CEA with autologous or synthetic patch angioplasty was technically successful in all 54 procedures. The method of closure of the arteriotomy during CEA, primary closure or patch angioplasty, did not influence the incidence of complications.",

    "abstract": "We tested the clinical applicability, technical results, and morbidity of carotid angioplasty-stenting (CAS) in the treatment of severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) in patients deemed to be high-risk candidates for carotid endarterectomy (CEA).\nAfter an initial series (1994-1997) of 52 interventions, we adopted the use of a transfemoral access technique and self-expanding stents in late 1997. From Dec 1, 1997, to Mar 31, 2001, 135 CAS procedures were performed on 132 patients with more than 70% (symptomatic) or more than 80% (asymptomatic) stenoses of the ICA. Sixty percent of the patients had no symptoms, and 40% of patients had symptoms. The interventional technique was standardized with the use of a 7F long interventional sheath, balloon pre-dilatation of the stenotic lesion, placement of a self-expanding stent (Wallstent in 12 patients and a SMART stent in 120 patients), and post-balloon dilatation when necessary. Brain protection devices were not used. Patients were given clopidogrel and aspirin before and after the procedure and heparin during the intervention.\nAll procedures except two were completed as planned, with access failure in three patients (2.2%). Residual in-stent stenosis of less than 20% was detected in 14 of 132 stented vessels (11%) and accepted as a satisfactory angiographic outcome. Neurologic complications included one patient with a single-episode transient ischemic attack (TIA; motor-sensory deficit of the hand) occurring 2 hours after CAS. One patient sustained a major stroke after thrombosis of the stented ICA, which occurred 3 days after the CAS procedure and 24 hours after open-heart surgery. A third patient sustained a minor stroke that began intraprocedurally after post-balloon dilatation of the stent, and a fourth patient had another minor stroke with transient aphasia (beginning during the procedure and resolving after 4 hours) and monoparesis of the hand, which resolved after 1 week. All stented vessels remained patent during the follow-up period (range, 2-41 months; mean, 16 plus minus 9 months), with four instances of hemodynamically significant in-stent restenosis. Re-intervention with balloon angioplasty was undertaken successfully at 4 months in one patient with restenosis. The periprocedural mortality rate was 0.\nCarotid stenting can be performed with acceptable safety on carefully selected patients by using meticulous, standardized interventional techniques. It may offer a possibly superior therapeutic alternative for non-CEA candidates. Evolving technological improvements and brain protection devices are likely to enhance its role in the treatment of carotid artery disease in the future.

    "abstract": "We describe outcomes in a cohort of patients undergoing subclavian carotid transposition (SCT) for occlusive disease of the first segment of the subclavian artery and perform a systematic review of the literature on SCT and carotid subclavian bypass grafting (CSB).\nRelevance, validity and extraction of review results were done in duplicate. Data were collected prospectively in our consecutive cohort of patients.\nFrom September 1990 to February 2001, we performed 27 SCTs, four for aneurysmal disease and 23 for occlusive disease. SCTs done for aneurysms were excluded from the current analysis. In patients with occlusive disease, the primary indications for surgery were vertebrobasilar and carotid symptoms (10, 44%), vertebrobasilar insufficiency (7, 30%), vertebrobasilar and arm symptoms (4, 17%), carotid symptoms (1, 4%), and vertebrobasilar, carotid, and arm symptoms (1, 4%). An SCT was performed in conjunction with an endarterectomy of the carotid artery in 12 patients (52%), with an endarterectomy of the subclavian artery in seven patients (30%), and with an endarterectomy of the vertebral artery in six patients (26%). A lymph leak complicated two surgeries (9%). In our series, patients improved clinically after surgery, and reconstructions were all found to be patent by means of Doppler ultrasound scanning at a mean follow-up of 25 +/- 21 months. Three patients (13%) died during follow-up of complications of coronary artery disease. From 1966 to 2000, 516 patients who underwent CSB and 511 patients who underwent a SCT were reported in the literature. Patency rates were 84% and 98%, respectively (P <.0001; absolute risk reduction, 15%; number-needed-to-treat-differently, 7), and the rates of freedom from symptoms were 88% and 99%, respectively, at a mean follow-up of 59 +/- 17 months (range, 1-228 months).\nOur cohort study showed that SCT is safe and effective for reconstruction of the first segment of the subclavian artery. The systematic review suggested that rates of patency and freedom from clinical symptoms are higher with SCT than with CSB.",

In patients with occlusive disease, the primary indications for surgery were vertebrobasilar and carotid symptoms (10, 44%), vertebrobasilar insufficiency (7, 30%), vertebrobasilar and arm symptoms (4, 17%), carotid symptoms (1, 4%), and vertebrobasilar, carotid, and arm symptoms (1, 4%). An SCT was performed in conjunction with an endarterectomy of the carotid artery in 12 patients (52%), with an endarterectomy of the subclavian artery in seven patients (30%), and with an endarterectomy of the vertebral artery in six patients (26%). A lymph leak complicated two surgeries (9%). In our series, patients improved clinically after surgery, and reconstructions were all found to be patent by means of Doppler ultrasound scanning at a mean follow-up of 25 +/- 21 months. Three patients (13%) died during follow-up of complications of coronary artery disease. From 1966 to 2000, 516 patients who underwent CSB and 511 patients who underwent a SCT were reported in the literature. Patency rates were 84% and 98%, respectively (P <.0001; absolute risk reduction, 15%; number-needed-to-treat-differently, 7), and the rates of freedom from symptoms were 88% and 99%, respectively, at a mean follow-up of 59 +/- 17 months (range, 1-228 months).",

    "abstract": "The benefits of the long-term administration of oral anticoagulant therapy remain unclear in patients with lower extremity arterial bypass surgery. We studied the effect of warfarin plus aspirin therapy (WASA) versus aspirin therapy alone (ASA) on patient mortality, morbidity and bypass patency rates in a randomized clinical trial.\nIn a multicenter, prospective, nonmasked clinical trial, 831 patients who underwent peripheral arterial bypass surgery were compared in a long-term treatment program of WASA (target international normalized ratio of 1.4 to 2.8; 325 mg/day) with ASA (325 mg/day). The primary end point was bypass patency, and mortality and morbidity were the secondary endpoints.\nThere were 133 deaths in the WASA group (31.8%) and 95 deaths in the ASA group (23.0%; risk ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.84; P =.0001). Major hemorrhagic events occurred more frequently in the WASA group (WASA, n = 35; ASA, n = 15; P =.02). In the prosthetic bypass group, there was no significant difference in patency rate in the 8-mm bypass subgroup, but there was a significant difference in patency rate in the 6-mm bypass subgroup (femoral-popliteal; 71.4% in the WASA group versus 57.9% in the ASA group; P =.02). In the vein bypass group, patency rate was unaffected (75.3% in the WASA group versus 74.9% in the ASA group).\nThe long-term administration of warfarin therapy when combined with aspirin therapy has only a few selected indications for improvement of bypass patency and is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.",

Twenty-two patients had ischemia of the lower limb, and five patients had severe reflex sympathetic dystrophy. The retroperitoneal space was developed with a balloon trocar inserted through a small incision in the flank. Additional trocars used for endoscopic instruments. The sympathetic chain from the ganglia second lumbar vertebrae to the fourth lumbar vertebrae was resected. The procedure was successfully accomplished in all the patients without any operative or postoperative complications. The mean operative time Was 136 minutes, and the mean hospital stay was 1.4 days. All the patients had significant improvement of pain or dystrophic changes. Retroperitoneoscopic lumbar sympathectomy successfully combines the advantages of minimally invasive surgery with the effectiveness of the open procedure.",

The suture line of the aortic wall was reinforced with a polytetrafluoroethylene felt strip. Histologically, the media and adventitia contained numerous lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates that consisted of B and activated T cells mixed with plasmacytes. These findings would have been in accordance with active aortitis. Systemic lupus erythematosus was suggested as possibly associated with nondissecting thoracic aortic aneurysm, especially in patients undergoing chronic steroid therapy in which inflammation continued.",

A 63-year-old man with significant coronary artery disease underwent endograft exclusion of abdominal aortic aneurysm with Aneurx graft. The patient was seen with a rupture of the aortic aneurysm, probably caused by poor proximal fixation of the graft associated with separation of the left iliac extension limb from the main body of the graft. Angulated right iliac limb of the stent graft penetrated into the Ivc just above the common iliac junction and caused sealed perforation. Successful repair with aortobiiliac graft reconstruction after removal of the endograft was accomplished. The IVC laceration was repaired. Possible mechanisms of failure of endograft are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease is a complex degenerative process that is associated with elevated proteolytic activity. This increased proteolytic activity may be linked to an imbalance in the protease regulatory mechanisms. We hypothesize that reduced AAA plasma inhibitory capacity is related to increased elastolytic activity observed in patients with AAA, which promotes matrix degradation in the aortic wall and AAA expansion.\nPreoperative plasma from patients with AAA (n = 86; mean age, 75 +/- 8 years) and healthy controls (n = 30; mean age, 72 +/- 10 years) was assayed for inhibitory capacity. Postoperative plasma inhibitory capacity was evaluated with comparison of the activity of porcine pancreatic elastase on succinylated elastin substrate, in the presence and absence of AAA and control plasma.\nAAA plasma showed a significantly reduced capacity to inhibit porcine pancreatic elastase (71.31% +/- 1.47%) compared with control plasma (85.52% +/- 1.70%; P <.001). Within the AAA group, the inhibitory capacity increased with AAA diameter (P <.05). In addition, surgical repair of AAA resulted in a significant increase in plasma inhibitory capacity (79.83% +/- 1.86%) as compared with preoperative levels (63.98% +/- 2.69%; P <.001). Of note, the postoperative plasma inhibitory capacity is not significantly different than that of control.\nAAA plasma has a significantly reduced inhibitory capacity, which varies with aortic diameter and returns to control levels after surgical repair of the AAA. This suggests that protease regulation is a dynamic balance that changes with AAA progression and may play an important role in AAA progression.",

    "abstract": "The major cause of vascular prosthesis failure is anastomotic intimal hyperplasia caused by the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is an endothelium-specific growth factor that exerts a mitogenic action on endothelial cells. This study was designed to examine the effect of HGF on the suppression of intimal hyperplasia after small-caliber expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafting.\nAn ePTFE graft, 2 mm in diameter and 30 mm in length, was implanted in the left common carotid arteries of Japanese white rabbits, after which the animals were fed with a 1.0% cholesterol diet. HGF was infused intravenously immediately and then every day for 7 days at doses of 0.3 mg/body (the 0.3-mg HGF group; n = 20) or 1.0 mg/body (the 1.0-mg HGF group; n = 17). A control group (n = 20) underwent infusion with saline solution. The rabbits were killed on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 28.\nThe patency rates on POD 28 were 33%, 55%, and 100% in the control, the 0.3-mg HGF, and the 1.0-mg HGF groups, respectively, with a significant difference between the control and the 1.0-mg HGF group (P <.05). Endothelial-like cells were seen on the intraluminal surface of the graft only near the anastomotic site on POD 5 in the 1.0-mg HGF group. Intimal thickness at the distal anastomosis was 284 +/- 140 microm, 106 +/- 18 microm, and 67 +/- 10 microm in the control, the 0.3-mg HGF, and the 1.0-mg HGF groups, respectively, with a significant difference between the control and both HGF groups (P <.05). The number of anti-embryonic smooth muscle antibody positive cells at the distal anastomosis was 28.6 +/- 0.8, 3.8 +/- 2.8, and 3.9 +/- 0.9 in the control, the 0.3-mg HGF, and the 1.0-mg HGF groups, respectively, with a significant difference between the control and both HGF groups (P <.01).\nHGF might suppress intimal thickness at the anastomotic site and improve the patency rate via rapid reendothelialization by POD 28 in a rabbit carotid ePTFE grafting model.",

In this study, we evaluated the long-term patency of venous reconstructions that had been revised, compared them with those bypass grafting procedures that did not require any intervention, and analyzed long-term outcome.\nIn the past 15 years, 3944 infrainguinal arterial reconstructions were completed with vein as the conduit. A total of 2780 were performed with the vein in situ, and 1164 were performed by using excised vein in a single piece or spliced configuration. Indication, risk factors, and patient demographics were evaluated. Grafts were stratified into revised and unrevised, in situ and excised; excised vein was then stratified into spliced and non-spliced. All grafts were followed with duplex ultrasound scans performed at 3, 6, and 12 months in the first year and every 6 months thereafter. Statistical analysis was performed by using Gehan's generalized Wilcoxon test.\nDemographics and indications were similar between groups. Nine percent of all excised veins required some revision, compared with 10% of all in situ reconstructions. When the excised veins were further stratified, 6% of single-piece venous conduits were revised, as opposed to 14% of reconstructions with spliced venous reconstruction. The 5-year patency rates were 67% for revised reconstructions and 78% for unrevised reconstructions (P <.0001). The 5-year patency rate of unrevised in situ bypass grafts was 81%, as compared with 69% for revised in situ reconstruction (P <.0001), and the 5-year patency rate for unrevised excised veins was 68%, with revised excised vein having a 5-year patency rate of 59% (P = not significant).\nVenous conduits that require revision have a significantly lower long-term patency rate than those that were unrevised. Grafts that require revision may be best suited for aggressive surveillance protocol to maximize long-term patency.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of pedal bypass grafts to foot vessels detected by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) that were occult in conventional angiography in patients with diabetes mellitus and severe arterial occlusive disease.\nVascular surgery and radiology registries were reviewed for patients with pedal bypass grafts to arteries that were not detected with digital subtraction angiography but unmasked with MRA. From December 1997 to March 1999, 15 patients (mean age, 73 +/- 8 years) were identified and analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were diabetic, with 60% being insulin-dependent. Advanced tissue loss was the operative indication in all the cases. Distal anastomosis was performed to the dorsalis pedis artery in 10 cases and to the plantar artery in five cases, with ipsilateral greater saphenous vein as graft material in all the cases.\nThe perioperative mortality rate was 7% (1 of 15 cases). One graft occlusion resulted in a secondary patency rate of 93.1%. During a mean follow-up examination period of 22 months, no graft occlusions and one major amputation were noted, which resulted in a secondary patency rate of 93.1% and a limb salvage rate of 89.5% at 36 months.\nFoot vessels that were occult in conventional angiography but could be detected with MRA were shown to be suitable target vessels for pedal bypass grafting with promising results.",

Data on operative details, morbidity, hospital stay, and graft patency were collected prospectively and compared. All patients were followed up for 12 months.\nThe group that underwent angioscopy (A) and the control group (B) were similar in all respects, except for the number of patients enrolled in the groups (32 and 69, respectively). Angioscopy revealed incompletely destructed valves in 34 patients (range, 0 to 5; mean 1), undiagnosed vein branches in 111 patients (mean 4.3), and partly occluding thrombus in 5 patients. The number of postoperative arteriovenous fistulas with signs of failing graft and a need for angiographic or surgical reintervention were significantly higher in group B (P <.0001). The 1-year primary patency rate was significantly better in group A (P <.01), but the primary assisted and secondary patency rates did not differ between the groups.\nAngioscopic assistance has an impact on primary graft patency, minimizes the risk for graft failure and thus reduces the need for reintervention by allowing identification of persistent saphenous vein branches, incomplete valve destruction, and partly occluding graft thrombus without adding extra operative time.",

The costs of routine screening and selective screening were determined with Medicare reimbursement schedules.\nThe prevalence rate of advanced (80% to 100%) carotid artery stenosis (CAS) was 3.4%, and 18% of the patients had CAS between 60% and 100%. Advanced peripheral vascular occlusive disease (PVOD; ABI, <0.3) was found in 3% of the patients, and 12% of the patients had an ABI of less than 0.6. Most patients with advanced CAS (71%) or advanced PVOD (83%) had clinical indications of their disease. The absence of clinical evidence of disease had a negative predictive value of 99% for both advanced CAS and PVOD. The cost of routine screening for all patients for advanced CAS was $5445 per case. Routine screening for severe PVOD costs were $3732 per case discovered. In contrast, the costs for selective screening for advanced CAS or PVOD in patients with appropriate history or symptoms were $1258 and $785 per case found, respectively.\nRoutine noninvasive diagnostic testing for the identification of asymptomatic CAS and PVOD in patients with AAA may not be justified.

    "abstract": "Post hoc analysis results of the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study suggest that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) may not be as efficacious in women as it is in men. This study was undertaken for the evaluation of whether there is a difference between men and women in early postoperative outcome after CEA and whether such a difference is consistent across other predictors.\nWe conducted a retrospective review of all CEAs entered into our departmental registry between January 1, 1989, and November 30, 2000. A total of 3422 CEAs was performed in 3077 consecutive patients. The ratio of men to women was 2:1, and the ratio of patients who were asymptomatic to patients who were symptomatic was 2.3:1. The following in-hospital outcome data were analyzed: transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, mortality, combined TIA or stroke, and combined stroke or mortality. Univariate and multivariate analysis results of selected risk factors for an adverse perioperative event were assessed with generalized estimating equation analysis with backwards selection. The following risk factors were considered: gender, preoperative neurologic status, urgency of operation, type of arteriotomy repair, reoperative CEA for recurrent stenosis, history of cardiopulmonary disease, previous coronary artery intervention, simultaneous CEA and coronary bypass grafting surgery, renal failure, and diabetes.\nUnivariate analysis results of gender differences revealed that women were at higher risk for a postoperative TIA or stroke (3.3% for women versus 2.1% for men; odds ratio [OR], 1.6; confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 2.5; P =.03) and for postoperative stroke or mortality (3.1% for women versus 2.1% for men; OR, 1.6; CI, 1.04 to 2.5; P =.03). Multivariate analysis results showed that female gender was an independent predictor for a postoperative TIA or stroke (OR, 1.7; CI, 1.1 to 2.6; P =.03). Further analysis disclosed that women who were asymptomatic were at greater risk than were men for postoperative stroke or mortality (OR, 2.3; CI, 1.3 to 3.9; P =.003). Conversely, there was no gender association for postoperative stroke or mortality in the consideration of only patients who were symptomatic (OR, 1.0; CI, 0.45 to 2.1; P =.95). The interaction between women and preoperative symptoms approached significance (P =.07) with respect to postoperative stroke and mortality rate, which suggests that the gender effect could be influenced by the clinical presentation.\nThe combined TIA or stroke and stroke or mortality rates are higher in women as compared with men in the postoperative period, but these risks remain acceptable when CEA is performed for appropriate indications. The interaction between symptoms and gender suggests that, in patients who are asymptomatic, women are more likely than are men to have early complications. However, there is no gender difference in patients who are symptomatic. Therefore, despite a low postoperative complication rate, CEA is appropriate in both women who are asymptomatic and women who are symptomatic only if the postoperative TIA, stroke, and mortality rates are appreciably lower than in the natural history of medical management of these patients.",

The interaction between women and preoperative symptoms approached significance (P =.07) with respect to postoperative stroke and mortality rate, which suggests that the gender effect could be influenced by the clinical presentation.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have linked carotid plaque surface irregularities with stroke risk, but this relationship has been obscured by the limited ability of available imaging modalities to resolve plaque surface morphology. To address this issue, we performed a prospective study correlating the presenting neurologic symptoms of patients with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; 200 microm) studies of ipsilateral plaque surface invaginations and ledges, lumen shape, and the location of the plaque bulk creating the stenosis.\nOne hundred patients, 17 women and 83 men, 45 to 81 years old (mean, 68 years) underwent surgery. Forty-five patients had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke as the indication for surgery, and 55 patients had no symptoms. Angiograms were obtained in 50 patients. Carotid plaques were removed \"en bloc\" and placed in gadolinium doped saline for imaging in a Siemens Symphony, 1.5T scanner with a custom-built transmit-receive radiofrequency coil. The resulting slice thickness was 200 microm, with 200 microm by 200 microm in plane resolution. The MRI data and angiograms were reviewed by using National Institutes of Health Image software and read by consensus. A surface irregularity was categorized as a ledge or ulcer and measured by using electronic calipers. Luminal shape was determined at the point of maximal stenosis with a \"slice\" set at 90 degrees to the lumen axis. The location of the maximal stenosis was recorded. In the internal carotid artery, plaque bulk was designated to be on the flow divider wall or non-flow divider wall.\nThe mean maximal stenosis was 81.5% +/- 12.0%. Surface contour irregularities were found in 80 plaques. Thirty-five plaques were graded as having major surface contour irregularities, and 45 plaques were graded as having minor irregularities. There was a significant correlation between major surface irregularity and TIA or stroke (P <.01). Irregular plaques were identified with angiography, but the irregularity in size was underestimated (P <.01). Only 28% of plaques had circular lumens; 50% had elliptical lumens, and 22% had either crescentic or multi-lobular lumens. The maximal stenosis was located in the internal carotid artery in 82 plaques, the bifurcation in 17 plaques, and the common carotid artery in one plaque.\nSurface irregularities were revealed by means of submillimeter resolution of the carotid plaques with MRI to be common, but only the presence of major irregularities correlated with the patient having TIA or stroke. Lumen shape and plaque location did not appear to predict stroke risk, but may effect imaging accuracy in determining the degree of stenosis. These data further define the relationship of plaque irregularity and cerebrovascular symptoms caused by atheroemboli.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was the examination of the feasibility of the retrojugular approach for carotid endarterectomy and the investigation of its safety and effectiveness. A consecutive prospective cohort of 43 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy with the retrojugular approach was compared with a retrospective cohort of 43 patients who underwent surgery with the standard antejugular technique. Age, sex, comorbidity, diagnostic investigations, and indications for surgery were comparable in both groups. In the retrojugular group, a carotid shunt was used in 18 patients (42%) and a patch closure in 15 patients (35%), and in the antejugular group, a carotid shunt was used in 43 patients (100%) and a patch closure in 20 patients (47%). There were no perioperative deaths, strokes, nerve injuries, or 30-day postoperative neurologic events. Wound hematomas were equally distributed in both groups (5%). Transient hoarseness was present in two patients in the antejugular group. The mean operative time was 72 +/- 15 minutes for the retrojugular technique and 100 +/- 27 for the antejugular technique (P <.0001). The hospital stay was 2 +/- 1 days in both groups. In conclusion, the retrojugular approach appears to be safe and the operative time may be shorter than with the antejugular approach.",

    "abstract": "Despite a rapid spread of the technique, very little is known about the laser-tissue interaction in endovenous laser treatment (EVLT). We evaluated EVLT of the incompetent greater saphenous vein (GSV) for efficacy, treatment-related adverse effects, and putative mechanisms of action.\nTwenty-six patients with 31 limbs of clinical stages C(2-6), E(P), A(S,P), P(R) with incompetent GSV proven by means of duplex scanning were selected for EVLT in an outpatient setting. A 600-microm fiber was entered into the GSV via an 18-gauge needle below the knee and proceeded to the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ). After infiltration of tumescent local anesthesia, multiple laser pulses of 15 J energy and a wavelength of 940 nm were administered along the vein in a standardized fashion. D-dimers were determined in peripheral blood samples 30 minutes after completion of EVLT in 16 patients and on postoperative day 1 in 20 patients. One GSV that was surgically removed after EVLT was examined by means of histopathology. Additionally, an experimental in vitro set-up was constructed as a means of investigating the mechanism of laser action within a blood-filled tube.\nA median of 80 laser pulses (range, 22-116 laser pulses) were applied along the treated veins. On days 1, 7, and 28, all limbs except one (97%) showed a thrombotically occluded GSV. In one patient, the vessel showed incomplete occlusion. The distance of the proximal end of the thrombus to the SFJ was a median 1.1 cm (range, 0.2-5.9 cm) in the remaining patients. Adverse effects in all 26 patients were ecchymoses and palpable induration along the thrombotically occluded GSV that lasted for 2 to 3 weeks. In two limbs (6%), thrombophlebitis of a varicose tributary required oral treatment with diclofenac. D-dimers in peripheral blood were tested with normal results in 14 of 16 patients 30 minutes after completion of the procedure and elevated results in 7 of 20 patients at day 1 after EVLT. However, an increase of D-dimers from day 0 to day 1 was observed in 15 of the 16 patients undergoing tests 30 minutes after EVLT and on day 1. The 940-nm laser was demonstrated by means of in vitro experiments and the histopathological examination of one explanted GSV to act by means of indirect heat damage of the inner vein wall.\nEVLT of the GSV with a 940-nm diode laser is effective in inducing thrombotic vessel occlusion and is associated with only minor adverse effects. Laser-induced indirect local heat injury of the inner vein wall by steam bubbles originating from boiling blood is proposed as the pathophysiological mechanism of action of EVLT.",

    "abstract": "Leg ulcers associated with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) frequently recur after healing. The risk of recurrence has not been well defined for patients in different anatomic and hemodynamic groups. We reviewed the risk of ulcer recurrence on the basis of clinical, etiologic, anatomic, and pathophysiologic criteria and hemodynamic characteristics of the affected limb as assessed with air plethysmography (APG).\nNinety-nine limbs with class 6 CVI were assessed clinically and with standing duplex ultrasound scanning and APG for the definition of clinical, etiologic, anatomic, and pathophysiologic criteria. Leg ulcers were treated with high-pressure compression protocols. Surgical correction of venous abnormalities was offered to patients with appropriate conditions. After ulcer healing, the limbs were placed in compressive garments and followed at 6-month intervals for ulcer recurrence.\nThe mean patient age was 54.3 years, and 46% of the patients were female. Corrective venous surgery was performed in 37 limbs. The mean follow-up time for all 99 limbs was 28 months. The ulcer recurrence rate with life table was 37% +/- 6% at 3 years and 48% +/- 10% at 5 years. The patients who underwent venous surgery had a significantly lower recurrence rate (27% +/- 9% at 48 months) than did those patients who had not undergone surgery (67% +/- 8% at 48 months; P =.005). The patients with deep venous insufficiency (DVI; n = 51) had significantly higher recurrence rates (66% +/- 8% at 48 months) than did the patients without DVI (n = 48; 29% +/- 9% at 48 months; P =.006). This difference was significant even after accounting for the effects of surgery (P =.03). The hazard ratio of ulcer recurrence increases by 14% for every unit increase in the venous filling index (VFI; P =.001). This remains significant even after accounting for the effects of surgery (P =.001). The combination of DVI and a VFI of more than 4 mL/s yields a risk of ulcer recurrence of 43% +/- 9% at 1 year and 60% +/- 10% at 2 years.\nLeg ulcers associated with CVI have a high rate of recurrence. Ulcer recurrence is significantly increased in patients with DVI and in patients who do not have venous abnormalities corrected surgically. The VFI obtained from APG is useful in the prediction of increased risk for recurrence, particularly in association with anatomic data.",

    "abstract": "Thrombophilia is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), which in turn is a major risk factor for chronic venous ulceration (CVU). However, the relationship between thrombophilia and CVU remains unknown. The aim of this study was to define the prevalence of thrombophilia in patients with CVU and to determine whether this is associated with a history or duplex scan evidence of DVT.\nEighty-eight patients with CVU were prospectively studied. The patients underwent clinical assessment and duplex ultrasound scanning. Blood was drawn for antithrombin, proteins C and S, activated protein C resistance, factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210A, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin antibodies.\nThe study included 35 men with a median age of 61 years (interquartile range, 45 to 72 years) and 53 women with a median age of 76 years (interquartile range, 69 to 82 years). Thirty-six percent of the patients had either a history or duplex scan evidence suggestive of previous DVT. The following abnormalities were detected: four, five, and six cases of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S deficiencies, respectively; 14 cases of activated protein C resistance; 11 cases of factor V Leiden mutation; three cases of prothrombin 20210A mutation; eight cases of lupus anticoagulant; and 12 cases of anticardiolipin antibodies. Thrombophilia was not significantly related to previous DVT, deep reflux, or disease severity.\nPatients with CVU have a 41% prevalence rate of thrombophilia. This rate is two to 30 times higher than the rate of the general population but is similar to that reported for patients with previous DVT. However, in patients with CVU, thrombophilia does not appear to be related to a history of DVT, a pattern of reflux, or severity of disease. Many patients with CVU may have unsuspected postthrombotic disease.",

This rate is two to 30 times higher than the rate of the general population but is similar to that reported for patients with previous DVT. However, in patients with CVU, thrombophilia does not appear to be related to a history of DVT, a pattern of reflux, or severity of disease.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to study the mechanism of venous valve closure in physiologic conditions in situ, particularly the clarification of the role of reversed flow through the valve in the closure of the valve cusps. A second purpose was the study of temporal relations between movements of the valve cusps, changes in geometry of venous sinus, and blood flow.\nTwelve healthy volunteers underwent examination with duplex ultrasound scanning. The time relationship between the flow and venous valve movements was analyzed on the basis of real time ultrasound scan records of the saphenofemoral junction. The size and shape of the common femoral vein and the proximal greater saphenous vein were measured with a planimeter.\nReverse flow below the valve was registered in only one of the 12 studied subjects. The maximum peak velocity of the reverse flow in this case was 0.8 cm/s and the duration was 0.2 seconds. The reverse flow was registered just before and just after valve closure. The mean duration of the outflow wave below the valve was 816 +/- 57 ms, which was not significantly different from the time of the valve cycle (819 +/- 55 ms; P =.864). The closure of the valve coincided with the decrease of the flow velocities. The first detectable movement of the valve cusps occurred 108 +/- 21 ms after the beginning of the flow deceleration. The mean time interval from the first cusp movement to the complete closure of the valve was 139 +/- 51 ms. Both the size and the shape of the sinus changed during the valve cycle. The size of the sinus increased as much as 127% of the baseline value (1.79 +/- 0.25 cm at baseline; 2.27 +/- 0.23 cm maximum; P =.02), and it became more spheric in shape. The changes in size and shape of the sinus coincided with the movements of the valve cusps. The first detectable change in the sinus size occurred 80 +/- 30 ms after the first detectable movement of the cusps toward closure.\nReverse flow through the valve is not necessary for the closure of the venous valve. The closure of the venous valve coincides with the decrease of the flow velocities and the ballooning of the sinus (increase of size and the curvature of the valve sinus).",

    "abstract": "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) remains a leading cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients who undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Although patients with previous thrombotic episodes are inherently at a higher risk for subsequent episodes of DVT, it remains difficult to predict such an occurrence and to make a diagnosis in early stages. One potentially useful assay that can be used in the determination of changes of coagulation among patients who undergo arthroplasty is platelet activation. The goal of this study was to establish a predictive value for DVT with measurement of P-selectin levels that could help in planning appropriate perioperative management strategies for patients at high risk for DVT.\nA total of 52 patients who underwent TKA with general anesthesia underwent contrast venography on the 5th postoperative day. Platelet activation before and after operation was measured with platelet surface expression of P-selectin with flow cytometry in these two groups of patients for TKA. None of the patients underwent any anticoagulation therapy.\nNineteen of the 52 patients for TKA showed radiologic evidence of DVT, whereas 33 patients for TKA had no radiologic signs of DVT. There was no difference in platelet activation at baseline, which was 1 hour before induction of anesthesia, between the two groups (P >.05) as measured with P-selectin assays. Differences were noted between the two groups on the 5th day after operation, wherein P-selectin was expressed in only 2.72% +/- 0.9% (mean +/- standard deviation) of platelets in patients for TKA with healthy venogram results. This differed significantly from platelets in patients for TKA with DVT, who had P-selectin expression of 6.56% +/- 3.1% (mean +/- standard deviation; P <.01). Sensitivity for the diagnosis of DVT with P-selectin assay was calculated to be 74%, and specificity was found to be 94%.\nThe findings showed that radiologically confirmed DVT in patients for TKA surgery with general anesthesia is associated with an elevated number of activated platelets. Perioperative assessment of P-selectin may predict the early onset of DVT in patients who undergo high risk surgical procedures like TKA. This laboratory assay may help prevent the occurrence of the fatal events caused by DVT with use of early therapeutic intervention, such as heparinization.",

    "abstract": "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a multifactorial disease. Recently, inflammation has been suggested as a risk factor for DVT. The question is whether inflammation is a cause of venous thrombosis or rather a result of the thrombotic process.\nWe studied the inflammatory response in the acute phase of DVT with interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and C-reactive protein (CRP) as inflammatory markers. Plasma concentrations were measured on the day of admission (day 0) in 40 patients with acute DVT confirmed with phlebography and in 33 patients with clinical suspicion of DVT but negative phlebography results (controls). In patients with DVT, inflammatory markers were also examined on five subsequent days.\nOn day 0, the median concentrations in plasma of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and CRP were 15.0 pg/mL (range, <3 to 70 pg/mL), 7.0 pg/mL (range, <3 to 76 pg/mL), 37.5 mg/L (range, <7 to 164 mg/L), respectively, in the patient group and less than 3 pg/mL (range, <3 to 11 pg/mL; P <.001), 6.0 pg/mL (range, <3 to 52 pg/mL; P =.08), and 5.0 pg/L (range, <7 to 66 pg/L; P <.001), respectively, in the controls. During the next days, interleukin-6 concentration showed a gradual decline in patients with DVT from 15.0 to 5.5 pg/mL (P <.001), interleukin-8 concentration was relatively constant in time, and CRP concentration declined from 37.5 to 21.5 mg/L (P =.01).\nOur data show an apparent inflammatory response with highest measured concentrations of inflammatory markers on the day of admission and a subsequent decrease during the next days. This response supports the hypothesis that elevated inflammatory markers are a result rather than a cause of venous thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was the comparison of intravascular ultrasound scanning (IVUS) with transfemoral venography in the assessment of chronic iliac vein obstruction.\nIVUS and standard, single-plane, transfemoral venography were performed in 304 consecutive limbs during balloon dilation and stenting of an obstructed iliac venous segment. The appearance of the obstruction was described, and the degree of stenosis (maximal diameter reduction) was estimated with venography and IVUS. The stenotic area was derived with diameter calculations (pir(2)) and also was measured with the built-in software of the IVUS apparatus before and after dilation and stenting in 173 limbs. Preoperative hand/foot differential pressure and preoperative dorsal foot venous and intraoperative transfemoral hyperemia-induced pressure elevations after intra-arterial injection of papaverine hydrochloride were measured.\nWith IVUS, fine intraluminal and mural details were detected (eg, trabeculation, frozen valves, mural thickness, and outside compression) that were not seen with venography. The median stenosis (with diameter reduction) on venographic results was 50% (range, 0 to 100%) and on IVUS results was 80% (range, 25% to 100%). In a comparison with IVUS as the standard, venography had poor sensitivity (45%) and negative predictive value (49%) in the detection of a venous area stenosis of >70%. The actual stenotic area was more severe when measured directly with IVUS (0.31 cm(2); range, 0 to 1.68 cm(2)) versus derived (0.36 cm(2); range, 0 to 3.08 cm(2); P <.001), probably as a result of the noncircular lumen geometry of the stenosis. No correlation was found between any of the preoperative or intraoperative pressure measurements and degree of stenosis with or without collaterals. When collaterals were present, a more severe stenosis (median, 85%; range, 25% to 100%) was observed (versus a 70% stenosis in the absence of collaterals; range, 30% to 99%; P <.001), along with actual stenotic area (with collaterals: median, 0.24 cm(2); range, 0 to 1.18 cm(2); without collaterals: median, 0.45 cm(2); range, 0.02 to 1.68 cm(2); P <.01) and a higher rate of hyperemia-induced pressure gradient (> or =2 mm Hg; with collaterals, 34%; without collaterals, 11%; P <.05).\nVenous IVUS appears to be superior to single-plane venography for the morphologic diagnosis of iliac venous outflow obstruction and is an invaluable assistance in the accurate placement of venous stents after venoplasty. No preoperative or intraoperative pressure test appears to adequately measure the hemodynamic significance of the stenosis. In lieu of adequate hemodynamic tests, IVUS determination of morphologically significant stenosis appears to be presently the best available method for the diagnosis of clinically important chronic iliac vein obstruction.

    "abstract": "Arteriovenous fistulae traditionally have been placed in the upper extremity. Experience with groin hemodialysis access has been discouraging because of high infection rates and associated limb amputation. We reviewed our experience with angioaccess grafts in the groin to assess safety and viability in our hemodialysis patient population.\nA retrospective review was performed of all groin hemodialysis access grafts placed at a single tertiary care center between June 1990 and February 1998. Demographics, complications, and subsequent treatment were recorded. Graft patency and infection rates were analyzed with life-table analysis.\nData were collected on 73 graft insertions. A total of 52 episodes of thrombosis occurred in 26 grafts. Primary patency rate was 71% at 1 year. Secondary patency rate was 83% at 1 year. There was a 22% incidence rate of infection.\nWe conclude that the incidence rate of infection and thrombosis in our series of femoral-based hemodialysis grafts is comparable with rates reported in the literature for upper extremity polytetrafluoroethylene angioaccess grafts. Although not considered a first choice, femoral artery-based hemodialysis access is a viable option when arteriovenous fistulae in the upper extremity cannot be constructed.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to define the incidence and treatment of endograft limb stenosis or occlusion (endograft limb dysfunction [ELD]) in a single center with the ANCURE unsupported bifurcated or aortouniiliac endograft by using intraoperative completion angiography and postoperative color duplex ultrasound scanning (CDU).\nSixty-seven endografts (58 bifurcated, 9 uniiliac) were implanted between February 1996 and July 2000. Intraoperative completion aortography was performed in every patient. Postoperative assessment of the endograft consisted of CDU and computed tomography scanning and kidney, ureter and bladder radiographs within 7 days of implantation, at 3 and 6 months after the operation, and every 6 months thereafter.\nAt the time of endograft implantation, widely patent normal-appearing endograft limbs were revealed by means of the initial completion angiogram in 58 of 67 patients (group 1). ELD subsequently developed in seven of these 58 patients (13.4%). The results of the completion angiogram were not normal in the remaining nine patients (group 2), leading to the deployment of a self-expanding stent within the endograft limbs. The results of subsequent angiography were normal. No ELD has occurred in any patient in group 2 to date. The primary assisted patency rate at 30 months was 88% +/- 5.2% for group 1 versus 100% +/- 0% for group 2 (P = not significant, Log-rank test). Postoperative ELD occurred in seven patients (10.4%). Endovascular graft thrombosis occurred in three patients (3 endograft limbs). In each case, an endovascular approach was attempted; however, the guidewire would not traverse the occluded endovascular graft limb. Revascularization was accomplished by means of femorofemoral bypass grafting. Endovascular graft stenosis occurred in four patients (4 endograft limbs). Three patients with bifurcated endografts and limb stenosis who had no symptoms diagnosed by means of CDU were successfully treated by means of balloon angioplasty with self-expanding stent implantation, and the endograft limbs remained patent at 3, 5, and 26 months follow-up. The remaining patient who had an aortouniiliac endograft with recurrent severe stenoses underwent endograft explantation and aortobifemoral bypass grafting. The overall incidence of ELD during or after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair was 23.8% (16 of 67 patients).\nUnsupported endografts are at risk for developing ELD. The use of stents for limb support at the time of the initial endograft implantation may prevent subsequent ELD and bears further study. Endograft limb occlusion usually presents with acute severe ischemic symptoms, and the failure of operative thrombectomy necessitates femorofemoral artery bypass grafting. Endograft limb stenosis is identified by means of CDU surveillance in the postoperative period. Prompt treatment with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/stent yields satisfactory primary assisted patency. Intraoperative intravenous ultrasound scanning, oblique angiograms, pressure gradients, and completion angiography may be necessary to detect and treat ELD.",

    "abstract": "Successful endovascular aortic aneurysm repair depends on exclusion and spontaneous thrombosis of the aneurysm sac. The need for chronic postoperative anticoagulation therapy could limit the applicability of this technology with delay or prevention of sac thrombosis resulting in endoleak formation and altered remodeling of the aneurysm sac. The purpose of this study was the determination of whether chronic therapeutic anticoagulation therapy with warfarin was associated with an increased incidence rate of early or delayed postoperative endoleaks or altered rates of reduction in aneurysm sac maximum diameter.\nTwo hundred thirty-two consecutive patients underwent abdominal aortic endografting during a 32-month period. The data were recorded prospectively with a current mean follow-up period of 18 months. The patients with endoleaks identified with 30-day postoperative computed tomographic scan angiograms subsequently underwent selective arteriography to characterize the source. The patients who underwent chronic warfarin therapy that resulted in a therapeutic internationalized normalized ratio comprised the study group. The control group was defined as all the patients with healthy coagulation profiles.\nThirty-six patients (15%) were undergoing warfarin therapy after surgery, and their conditions were chronically maintained with a therapeutic international normalized ratio. Forty-three patients (18%) had endoleaks on 30-day computed tomographic scan angiographic results. There were 39 patients with type II endoleaks and four patients with type I endoleaks. None of the type I endoleaks occurred in patients who were undergoing warfarin therapy, and all endoleaks were repaired with either proximal or distal covered extensions. At 30 days, seven patients (19.4%) undergoing chronic warfarin therapy had type II endoleaks as compared with 36 controls (18.4%; P =.798). Four patients had delayed type II endoleaks develop, two in the control group and two in the warfarin group (P =.3). Ten control individuals (31%) had spontaneous resolution of type II endoleaks develop, whereas spontaneous endoleak thrombosis was not observed in the warfarin group (P =.33). Aneurysm sac remodeling assessed with mean percent reduction in maximum sac diameter at 12 months revealed a statistical difference between the control group (17.5%) and the warfarin group (7.6%; P =.04).\nWarfarin treatment is not associated with an increase in the incidence rate of early or delayed postoperative endoleaks. However, the rate of reduction in maximum aneurysm sac diameter after aortic endografting is slower in patients who undergo therapeutic warfarin therapy at 1-year follow-up examination, a statistically significant difference from the control group. In addition, type II endoleaks may be less likely to undergo spontaneous thrombosis in patients who undergo warfarin therapy.",

    "abstract": "Intimal hyperplasia is known to promote in-stent restenosis after vascular stent implantation. Although previous studies have presented a variety of evidence that suggests the mechanisms of intimal lesion formation, it is still controversial which factor(s) predominantly contribute to the development of in-stent restenosis. In this study, we hypothesized that heterogeneous mechanisms coexist in the same lesion and then assessed the validity with resected whole arteries with in-stent lesions.\nWhole arterial specimens with in-stent lesions were surgically resected from five patients who had undergone implantation of a Palmaz-Schatz stent 7 to 19 months previously and were histologically analyzed. For assessment of the pathogenetic heterogeneity of in-stent lesions, we divided each cross section into three parts: the inner intima within 250 microm from the luminal surface (zone A), the area surrounding the stent struts within 250 microm from the strut hole (zone B), and the remaining part of the intimal layer (zone C). We then evaluated cell density, cell replication, and cellular composition in each zone. Cell replication and cellular composition were analyzed with immunohistologic staining with antibodies against proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cell-specific antibodies. Each section was also stained with Alcian blue or Elastica van Gieson method for detection of matrix components.\nIn all samples, the cell density of zone A was significantly higher than that of zone B (P <.05). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining results showed significantly higher cell replication in zone A as compared with that in other zones (P <.05). To the contrary, cell-specific immunostaining results revealed marked accumulation of leukocytes, macrophages, and T lymphocytes in zone B (P <.05). Regarding matrix components, proteoglycan was predominantly stained around stent struts and in the inner intima.\nThe data of this study showed that two different pathogenetic processes in different zones possibly contributed to in-stent lesion formation at the same time. One process was an increase of cell number in the inner intima, which was the result of a prolonged increase of cell replication. The other process was accumulation of matrix around stent struts, which was suggested to be linked to infiltration of inflammatory cells in the same zone.",

The eligibility requirements included: AAA from 3.0 cm to 3.9 cm in diameter and at least one repeat ultrasound scan more than 90 days after the initial screening. Patients also completed a questionnaire for demographic data and the determination of the presence of risk factors associated with AAA. The study endpoints included: 1, both mean and median expansion rates; 2, moderate expansion (>4 mm/year); 3, no expansion; 4, all causes of death; 5, AAA rupture; 6, expansion to 4 cm or more; 7, expansion to 5.0 cm or more; and 8, operative repair.\nUltrasound scan screening results identified 1445 patients with 3.0-cm to 3.9-cm AAAs. Seven hundred ninety men met the ultrasound scan criterion of having at least two ultrasound scan studies during the study period, and these 790 men were used for this study. Mean AAA size was 3.3 cm, with an average follow-up period of 3.89 +/- 1.93 years. The median expansion rate was 0.11 cm/year. Expansion rates were significantly different (P <.001) between 3.0-cm and 3.4-cm cm AAA and 3.5-cm and 3.9-cm AAA. There were no reported AAA ruptures during the study period, although cause of death data were available in only 43% of the patients.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether circulating markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis may be used to distinguish acutely symptomatic nonruptured and ruptured AAA.\nA prospective study was performed of 44 patients who underwent emergency AAA repair for suspected rupture. Platelet count, fibrinogen level, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity, prothrombin fragment (PF) 1+2 level, and D dimer level were measured before surgery.\nWhen compared with ruptured AAAs (n = 37), acutely symptomatic nonruptured AAAs (n = 7) were associated with increased fibrinogen level (P =.033), reduced activated partial thromboplastin time (P =.043), increased t-PA activity (P =.023), reduced PAI activity (P =.005), reduced PF 1+2 level (P =.001), and reduced D dimer level (P =.005; all P values determined with Mann-Whitney test). The differences in t-PA activity (P =.01), PAI activity (P =.004), and PF 1+2 level (P =.01) persisted in patients whose conditions were normotensive. In all patients, a PF 1+2 level of greater than or equal to 2.5 nmol/L was associated with a sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value for rupture of 89%, 86%, 97%, and 60%, respectively. In patients whose conditions were normotensive, PAI activity of greater than or equal to 16 AU/mL was associated with a sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of 83%, 100%, 100%, and 88%, respectively.\nThese data show that acutely symptomatic nonruptured AAA is associated with increased systemic fibrinolysis (caused by reduced fibrinolytic inhibition) and reduced thrombin generation as compared with rupture. Preoperative hemostatic markers, particularly PF 1+2 level and PAI activity, may distinguish acutely symptomatic nonruptured from ruptured AAA.",

    "abstract": "A minimally invasive vascular surgery (MIVS) technique for repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with iliac involvement was evaluated, and its outcome was compared with conventional open repair.\nTwenty patients with AAA with iliac involvement underwent treatment with bifurcated graft replacement with the MIVS technique. The procedure was performed via minilaparotomy, with the incision length determined according to the extent of the AAA obtained with ultrasound scanning and with the small intestine confined completely within the abdominal cavity. The proximal and distal operating fields were obtained with changing the patient position and arranging for the abdominal incision to be retracted cephalad and caudad. Perioperative courses in these 20 patients (the MIVS group) were analyzed in comparison with 14 patients who underwent conventional open repair, which was performed through the full midline laparotomy with the intestine simply covered with moistened towels (the conventional group).\nThe MIVS technique for AAA repair was performed with a mean abdominal incision length of 8.4 cm and a range from 6.5 to 11.2 cm. The patients in the MIVS group showed earlier resumption of oral intake and ambulation in comparison with those patients in the conventional group (liquid diet: 1.1 +/- 0.3 days versus 2.9 +/- 1.4 days; P <.01; solid diet: 2.0 +/- 0.2 days versus 3.9 +/- 1.4 days; P <.01; ambulation: 2.1 +/- 0.8 days versus 4.3 +/- 2.3 days; P <.01), with comparable mortality and morbidity rates. Accordingly, the patients in the MIVS group were discharged earlier (20.7 +/- 6.3 days versus 33.9 +/- 12.6 days; P <.01), and total hospitalization charges were significantly decreased (2,232,791 +/- 200,747 Japanese yen versus 2,640,441 +/- 243,889 Japanese yen; P <.01).\nThe MIVS technique allowed earlier postoperative recovery with comparable morbidity and mortality rates with the conventional technique and, therefore, saved hospital stay length and total hospitalization charges. Thus, the MIVS technique is considered as a new and effective minimally invasive technique for open AAA repair.",

The determination of functional outcome and the identification of predictors of survival and functional recovery after TAAA repair are key to proper patient selection.\nThis retrospective review of clinical data was performed in an academic medical center. The demographics, Crawford aneurysm type (I-18, II-33, III-22, IV-28), preoperative risk factors, operative characteristics, and postoperative complications and outcomes were recorded from the medical records for 101 consecutive patients who underwent TAAA repair (58 elective and 43 urgent/emergent). Functional status and living situation at hospital discharge and 12 months after discharge were determined from follow-up examination records or telephone contact with surviving patients. The patients then were categorized into \"good\" (survival, home, discharge to rehabilitation center, ambulatory) or \"bad\" (death, discharge to or residence in a long-term care facility, non-ambulatory) outcomes.\nThe postoperative mortality rate was 17.8% (10% in elective cases and 28% in urgent cases), and significant postoperative complications occurred in 77% of the cases (pulmonary complications in 41%, renal complications in 28%, and cord injury in 12%). The mean length of stay was 22.8 + 23.6 days, and at discharge, 80% of the patients were sent to home or rehabilitation and 20% were sent to long-term care facilities. At 1 year, 15 additional patients had died. All but two patients who had been initially discharged to rehabilitation had returned home, but only two patients who had been discharged to long-term care facilities had returned home and both were nonambulatory. Therefore, the survival rate at 1 year was 67%, and only 52.4% of the patients had a \"good\" outcome at 1 year (survival rate was 78% and rate of \"good\" outcome was 63% in patients who underwent elective TAAA repair). Independent predictors of postoperative death and \"bad\" outcome were age more than 75 years, preoperative heart disease, duration of visceral ischemia, use of left atrial femoral bypass graft, postoperative renal dysfunction, and number of organs failing after surgery.\nSurvival and good functional outcome after TAAA repair is significantly less common than expected and is primarily predicted with intraoperative factors and postoperative complications. Improved operative techniques and limitation of visceral ischemia reperfusion injury may improve outcome after TAAA repair.",

    "abstract": "Despite the use of various strategies for the prevention of spinal cord ischemia, paraplegia and paraparesis continue to occur after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. Although cerebrospinal fluid drainage (CSFD) is often used as an adjunct for spinal cord protection, its benefit remains unproven. The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the impact of CSFD on the incidence of spinal cord injury after extensive TAAA repair.\nAfter randomization, 145 patients underwent extent I or II TAAA repairs with a consistent strategy of moderate heparinization, permissive mild hypothermia, left heart bypass, and reattachment of patent critical intercostal arteries. The repairs were performed with CSFD (n = 76) or without CSFD (n = 69). In the former group, CSFD was initiated during the operation and continued for 48 hours after surgery. The target CSF pressure was 10 mm Hg or less.\nThe two groups had similar risk factors for paraplegia. Aortic clamp time, left heart bypass time, and number of reattached intercostal arteries were also similar in both groups. Thirty-day mortality rates were 5.3% (four patients) and 2.9% (two patients) for CSFD and control groups, respectively (P =.68). Nine patients (13.0%) in the control group had paraplegia or paraparesis develop. In contrast, only two patients in the CSFD group (2.6%) had deficits develop (P =.03). No patients with CSFD had immediate paraplegia. Overall, CSFD resulted in an 80% reduction in the relative risk of postoperative deficits.\nPerioperative CSFD reduces the rate of paraplegia after repair of extent I and II TAAAs.",

    "abstract": "Ongoing advances in peripheral endovascular technology have been met with disappointing results because of restenosis within the treated vessel. In particular, stent balloon angioplasty of peripheral vessels has yet to achieve patency rates that approximate conventional treatment in the long term. Recent advances in stent, balloon, and wire construction include the incorporation of radioactive substances in an attempt to ameliorate the inflammatory response provoked by typical endovascular manipulation, a technique termed vascular brachytherapy. gamma- and beta-isotopes and external beam radiation target the very cell population whose activity results in the development of neointimal hyperplasia. Although most clinical research examining the efficacy of vascular brachytherapy has emerged from the coronary artery literature, the use of vascular brachytherapy also has been examined in the peripheral arterial tree and has shown promising results. Current data indicate that vascular brachytherapy is a safe and accessible adjunctive endovascular maneuver that may improve the short-term patency rate of peripheral endovascular applications. The effects on long-term patency rates remain indeterminate compared to conventional therapy.",

    "abstract": "Endoleaks and endotension are critically important complications of some endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs (EVARs). For the resolution of controversial issues and the determination of areas of uncertainty relating to these complications, a conference of 27 interested leaders was held on November 20, 2000.\nThese 27 participants (21 vascular surgeons, five interventional radiologists, one cardiologist) had previously answered 40 key questions on endoleaks and endotension. At the conference, these 40 questions and participant answers were discussed and in some cases modified to determine points of agreement (consensus), near consensus (prevailing opinion), or disagreement.\nConference discussion added two modified questions for a total of 42 key questions for the participants. Interestingly, consensus was reached on the answers to 24 of 42 or 57% of the questions, and near consensus was reached on 14 of 42 or 33% of the questions. Only with the answers to four of 42 or 10% of the questions was there persistent controversy or disagreement.\nThe current endoleak classification system with some important modifications is adequate. Types I and II endoleak occur after 0 to 10% and 10% to 25% of EVARs, respectively. Many (30% to 100%) type II endoleaks will seal and have no detrimental effect, which never or rarely occurs with type I endoleaks. Not all endoleaks can be visualized with any technique, and increased pressure (endotension) can be transmitted through clot. Aneurysm pulsatility after EVAR correlates poorly with endoleaks and endotension. An enlarging aneurysm after EVAR mandates surgical or interventional treatment. These and other conclusions will help to resolve controversy and aid in the management of these vexing complications and should also point the way to future research in this field.",

    "conclusions": "The current endoleak classification system with some important modifications is adequate. Types I and II endoleak occur after 0 to 10% and 10% to 25% of EVARs, respectively. Many (30% to 100%) type II endoleaks will seal and have no detrimental effect, which never or rarely occurs with type I endoleaks. Not all endoleaks can be visualized with any technique, and increased pressure (endotension) can be transmitted through clot. Aneurysm pulsatility after EVAR correlates poorly with endoleaks and endotension. An enlarging aneurysm after EVAR mandates surgical or interventional treatment. These and other conclusions will help to resolve controversy and aid in the management of these vexing complications and should also point the way to future research in this field.",

    "abstract": "Since their introduction into clinical trials in the United States, endovascular aortic grafts have shown various types of problems. Although details of design and construction vary between different endovascular grafts and failure modes have had a variety of causes and clinical effects, the inability of preclinical testing to predict these failures remains common to all endovascular grafts. The need to improve preclinical testing in an attempt to reduce clinical device failures resulted in a Food and Drug Administration-sponsored workshop on endovascular graft preclinical testing held in Rockville, Md, from July 31 to August 1, 2001. FORMAT: The workshop was not designed as a consensus conference. Instead, it provided a forum for bringing stakeholders together to define problems and identify areas of agreement and disagreement. The workshop had 34 invited participants who represented device manufacturers, the medical community, the Food and Drug Administration, and testing facilities, and international attendance was more than 120 people.\nDiscussion centered on: 1, defining the physiologic, anatomic, and morphologic characteristics of abdominal aortic aneurysms before and after endovascular graft treatment; 2, identifying the types of failures that have been observed clinically; and 3, determining which characteristics should be considered during preclinical modeling to better predict clinical performance. Attendees agreed to the need to better define and address anatomic characteristics and changes in the aneurysm after endograft treatment to optimize preclinical testing. Much discussion and little agreement occurred on the importance of flow-related forces on graft performance or the need or ability to define and model physiologic compliance during durability testing. The discussion and conclusions are summarized in this paper and are provided in detail at: http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/meetings/073101workshop.html.\nThe workshop raised awareness of significant performance issues and the challenges of modeling the extremely variable and relatively undefined environment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Through the interactive format of the workshop, participants identified areas of preclinical testing, device design, and aspects of the simulated environment that need further consideration.",

    "abstract": "Porcelain aorta is an indication for axillofemoral bypass. However, the procedure has definitive flaws. We present a new method for achievement of aortofemoral bypass.\nThe portion of the distal aorta for anastomosis is wrapped with a double polytetrafluoroethylene mesh and fixed to the adventitia with continuous sutures. The adventitia of the anastomotic site is cut over the mesh until the calcified surface is disclosed. Margins of the mesh and the peeled adventitia are fixed along the anastomotic margin with continuous sutures. After the aorta and distal arteries are occluded with balloon catheters, an opening on the bared calcification is made with an airdrill and enlarged with a laminectomy rongeur. The anastomosis is performed between a graft and the mesh-reinforced adventitia with continuous sutures. Over 6 years, this method has been applied to nine patients with porcelain aorta who are diabetic or undergoing dialysis. The indications were disabling claudication in three patients and limb salvage in six patients.\nNo anastomotic complications or operative deaths were seen, and satisfactory mid-term results were obtained, with follow-up ranging from 3 to 62 months after surgery. One patient died of coronary heart disease 3 years after surgery, but the grafts retained a good function.\nThis method is safe and effective, and more liberal application of this method may help improve outcome and quality of life.",

We describe a novel technique for the insertion of new polytetrafluoroethylene graft segments designed to reduce this morbidity rate. Patients found to have significant intragraft deterioration at thrombectomy undergo insertion of a new nonanastamosed graft parallel to the existing graft. At the next failure of the existing graft, the nonanastamosed segment is anastamosed and used immediately for dialysis, obviating the need for a temporary catheter. Thirty patients have undergone this technique, and 89% of those who returned to surgery have had successful anastamosis of their new segments. Two patients were found to have inadequate incorporation of their new segments into the subcutaneous tissue, and one became frankly infected.",

Twenty-four hours later, the leg swelling increased, and at the reexploration, the common iliac vein was found to be occluded by an organized thrombus as the result of a well-endothelialized membranous band (Cockett or May-Turner syndrome). A Palma-Dale operation (crossover saphenous bypass grafting) was performed secondarily. The swelling in the leg diminished slowly, and the patient was discharged 10 days later with an oral anticoagulant therapy and elastic stockings.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation is likely a major contributor to spinal cord reperfusion injury after aortic reconstruction. Systemic 4-(3-[6-amino-9-(5-ethylcarbamoyl-3,4-dihydroxy-tetrahydro-furan-2-yl)-9H-purin-2-yl]-prop-2-ynyl)-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid methyl ester (ATL-146e), a selective adenosine A(2A) agonist, has been shown to reduce paralysis after spinal cord ischemia. We hypothesized that ATL-146e reduces cytokine production during spinal cord reperfusion, curtailing inflammation and decreasing spinal cord capillary platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) expression.\nNew Zealand White rabbits sustained spinal cord ischemia with 45-minute cross-clamping of the infrarenal aorta. One group of animals received intravenous ATL-146e at 0.06 microg/kg/min for 3 hours during reperfusion, beginning after 30 minutes of ischemia. A second group received saline solution vehicle alone for 3 hours, serving as an ischemic control. A third group served as sham-operated animals, undergoing laparotomy with anesthesia. Serum was assayed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for tumor necrosing factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Animals were allowed to recover for 48 hours and were evaluated for hind-limb motor function with the Tarlov (0 to 5) scoring system. At necropsy, animals from each group yielded spinal cords for immunohistochemical staining for PECAM-1. Data are expressed as mean +/- standard error of the mean, with statistical analysis with Student t test and Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test.\nMarkedly improved Tarlov scores were seen in rabbits with ATL-146e (P <.001) during spinal cord reperfusion as compared with ischemic control animals. A significant reduction was found in TNF-alpha in the sera of rabbits with ATL-146e infusion (P <.01) as compared with ischemic control animals. Significantly reduced endothelial PECAM-1 staining intensity (P <.05) was seen in microscopic spinal cord sections from rabbits with ATL-146e.\nATL-146e, an adenosine A(2A) agonist, reduces spinal cord reperfusion injury. The mechanism of the protection may involve a reduction in circulating TNF-alpha during a critical 3-hour reperfusion interval and reduction in spinal cord endothelial PECAM-1 upregulation.",

    "abstract": "Aortic inflammation and the genes that regulate the immune response play an important role in abdominal aortic aneurysm pathogenesis. However, the modulating effects of such genetic and other environmental factors on the severity on aneurysm inflammation is not known. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes, gender, and environmental factors on degree of abdominal aortic aneurysm tissue inflammation.\nAneurysm specimens were obtained at the time of operation from 96 consecutive patients who underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and were graded for degree of histologic inflammation. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the association of genetic and environmental factors with degree of inflammation and to determine the HLA-associated disease risk for aneurysm.\nActive cigarette smoking and female gender were independently associated with high-grade tissue inflammation identified histologically (odds ratio [OR], confidence interval [CI]: 5.6, 1.6 to 19.3; and 6.0, 1.4 to 26.2, respectively), and a specific HLA allele (DR B1(*)01) was inversely associated with inflammation (OR, CI: 0.2, 0.04 to 0.7). Overall, the HLA-DR B1(*)02 and B1(*)04 alleles were significantly associated with disease risk, more than doubling risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm (OR, CI: 2.5, 1.4 to 4.3; and 2.1, 1.2 to 3.7, respectively).\nActive cigarette smoking and female gender are significant disease-modulating factors associated with increased abdominal aortic aneurysm inflammation. In addition, the HLA class II immune response genes possess both disease modulating and disease risk properties, which may be useful in early aneurysm detection and surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Supplemental oxygen can reduce intimal hyperplasia (IH) after stent deployment in a rabbit model.\nEndovascular stent placement is technically feasible, but long-term durability in vessels outside the aortoiliac system is compromised with postinterventional IH, which causes restenosis and failure of the arterial conduit.\nGroups (n = 4 to 6) of female New Zealand white rabbits underwent placement of a 3-mm intraaortic stent with laparotomy and were placed in either normoxic (21% inspired oxygen concentration) or supplemental-oxygen (40% inspired oxygen concentration) environments for 0, 7, 14, and 28 days. The transarterial wall oxygen gradient was measured at 0, 7, and 28 days with an oxygen microelectrode. 5-Bromo-2'deoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected into the peritoneum before death to assess cellular proliferation. Aortic specimens were harvested en bloc and sectioned for analysis of cellular proliferation and intimal thickness.\nIntraaortic stent placement significantly decreased the transarterial wall oxygen gradient in the outer 70% of the vessel wall and was easily reversed at 7, 14, and 28 days with application of supplemental oxygen. Cellular proliferation was significantly decreased at 14 days (0.5% +/- 0.001% versus 2.3% +/- 0.002%; P <.001) and 28 days (0.4% +/- 0.001% versus 1.0% +/- 0.001%; P <.025) as measured with count of nuclei staining for 5-Bromo-2'deoxyuridine in the intima and media.

Forty-percent supplemental oxygen suppresses IH by 44% at 28 days as compared with normoxic control values.

We have investigated the capacity of a water-soluble nonanticoagulant functionalized dextran (E9) in inhibition of SMC growth in vitro and in vivo.\nE9 was obtained with chemical substitutions with anionic and hydrophobic groups on the dextran backbone. SMC proliferation (cell counting, thymidine uptake, cell cycle analysis) was followed in culture in the presence of E9. Western blot analysis against phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, and assessment of MAPK activity on serum-stimulated SMCs also were investigated. Binding/displacement experiments, electron microscopy, and cell fractionations were used to follow the binding and internalization of radiolabeled and fluorescentlabeled E9. New Zealand white rabbit iliac arteries were injured with balloon dilatation and stent deployment. Animals were treated for 14 days with saline solution or E9 (5 mg/kg injected subcutaneously, twice daily). Morphometric analyses were carried out in each group (n = 6 arteries, 18 sections).\nNonanticoagulant E9 inhibited SMC proliferation in vitro. Tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK 1/2 and MAPK activity were inhibited with E9 within 5 minutes of incubation. The binding and rapid cytoplasmic internalization of the synthetic compound was evidenced, but, in contrast to heparin, we did not detect any nuclear localization of the antiproliferative E9. In the in vivo model, qualitative modifications of neointimal structure with a thinner fibrocellular neointima were noticed after E9 treatment. Morphometric analyses of stented arteries in E9-treated animals indicated an important reduction (P <.01) of intimal growth: 33% and 45% for intimal area and intima/media ratio, respectively.\nCytoplasmic internalization of the synthetic polysaccharide correlated to the SMC growth inhibition that involved the MAPK pathway. In vivo inhibition of intimal instent hyperplasia with this nonanticoagulant derived dextran is shown providing a new candidate for a potential selective treatment of SMC proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Neuroprotection during carotid stenting has the potential to reduce procedural atheroembolic sequelae. We report the United Kingdom experience of NeuroShield (MedNova Ltd, Horsham, West Sussex, United Kingdom).\nWe performed a prospective cohort analysis of 50 consecutive patients (50 lesions) in a regional vascular tertiary referral center (catchment area one million) that provides an institutional service for the short term. The subjects were all the patients referred for carotid stenting after preassessment by a multidisciplinary team. All the patients underwent pretreatment with antiplatelet agents. Forty-two patients had atherosclerotic stenosis of the carotid bifurcation between 70% and 95% (with North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria). Six patients had restenosis after endarterectomy. Two had previous local radiotherapy. Forty-two patients were symptomatic (amaurosis fugax/central retinal artery occlusion in 11 cases, and hemispheric transient ischemic attack/cerebrovascular accident in 31 cases). Eight patients were asymptomatic with bilateral high-grade stenoses, with six cases before coronary artery bypass grafting. The intervention performed was protected primary carotid stenting. Outcome measures were procedural atheroembolic events, including all-stroke and death rates up to 30 days, and analysis of retrieved debris in a subset of 11 cases.\nThe technical success rate was 50/50 (100%) for stenting and 49/50 (98%) for filter placement/retrieval. Technical complications comprised nonsymptomatic spasm at the filter site (flow limiting in two cases and non-flow limiting in five cases). Procedural events were one minor stroke (patient fully recovered within 48 hours) in a complex clinical setting and one ventricular fibrillation arrest in a patient before coronary artery bypass grafting who was resuscitated without neurologic event. At 30 days, the death or major disability from stroke rate was 2/50 (4%). No cases were atheroembolic. The all-stroke/death rate was 3/50 (6%). The two deaths were the result of a fatal hemorrhagic stroke that occurred at 4 days and was thought to be caused by reperfusion and a perforated ventricle caused by a temporary pacing wire.

At 30 days, the death or major disability from stroke rate was 2/50 (4%). No cases were atheroembolic. The all-stroke/death rate was 3/50 (6%).

    "abstract": "The aim of this randomized study was to compare a new method of endovenous saphenous vein obliteration (Closure System, VNUS Medical Technologies, Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif) with the conventional stripping operation in terms of short-term recovery and costs.\nTwenty-eight selected patients for operative treatment of primary greater saphenous vein tributary varicose veins were randomly assigned to endovenous obliteration (n = 15) or stripping operation (n = 13). Postoperative pain was daily assessed during the 1st week and on the 14th postoperative day. The length of sick leave was determined. The RAND-36 health survey was used to assess the patient health-related quality of life. The patient conditions were controlled 7 to 8 weeks after surgery, and patients underwent examination with duplex ultrasonography. The comparison of costs included both direct medical costs and costs resulting from lost of productivity of the patients. Costs that were similar in the study groups were not considered in the analysis.\nAll operations were successful, and the complication rates were similar in the two groups. Postoperative average pain was significantly less severe in the endovenous obliteration group as compared with the stripping group (at rest: 0.7, standard deviation [SD] 0.5, versus 1.7, SD 1.3, P =.017; on standing: 1.3, SD 0.7, versus 2.6, SD 1.9, P =.026; on walking: 1.8, SD 0.8, versus 3.0, SD 1.8, P =.036; with t test). The sick leaves were significantly shorter in the endovenous obliteration group (6.5 days, SD 3.3 days, versus 15.6 days, SD 6.0 days; 95% CI, 5.4 to 12.9; P <.001, with t test). Physical function was also restored faster in the endovenous obliteration group. The estimated annual investment costs of the closure operation were US $3360. The other direct medical costs of the Closure operation were about $850, and those of the conventional treatment were $360. With inclusion of the value of the lost working days, the Closure treatment was cost-saving for society, and when 40% of the patients are retired (or 60% of the productivity loss was included), the Closure procedure became cost-saving at a level of 43 operations per year.\nEndovenous obliteration may offer advantages over the conventional stripping operation in terms of reduced postoperative pain, shorter sick leaves, and faster return to normal activities, and it appears to be cost-saving for society, especially among employed patients. Because the procedure is also associated with shorter convalescence, this new method may potentially replace conventional varicose vein surgery.",

    "abstract": "A revised Goldman Cardiac Risk Index has been suggested to identify patients at higher risk for cardiac complications in patients who undergo major noncardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to test the usefulness of this model in an independent series of patients who underwent abdominal aortic surgery and to compare the index with the multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scan in the prediction of cardiac complications.\nWe studied 77 patients who underwent MUGA scan before elective abdominal aortic reconstruction. The revised index was calculated for each patient after recording the following five risk factors: history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, and creatinine level more than 2 mg/dL. Technetium-99m MUGA scan provided information about the resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the presence of regional wall motion abnormalities.\nFourteen patients (18%) had cardiac complications develop. The index proved to be a satisfactory predictor of postoperative cardiac events (P =.008), and an abnormal LVEF failed to do so (P =.1). The presence of wall abnormalities, with or without an abnormal LVEF, predicted cardiac complications (P =.004 and P =.006). Patients with a higher index score showed a tendency to have a lower LVEF (Spearman rank correlation, r = -0.43; P <.001). Wall abnormalities, with or without an abnormal LVEF, were more frequent in patients with higher scores (P =.03 and P =.009). Combining the index with the LVEF or the wall abnormalities or both could further stratify the cardiac risk (P =.004, P =.0003 and P =.0006, with chi(2) test for trend).\nFor those patients who undergo elective abdominal aortic surgery, the revised Goldman Cardiac Risk Index is a simple method of evaluating cardiac risk with minimum resource implications. MUGA scan can offer additional stratification in patients judged with the index to be at high risk.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are associated with generalized arterial dilation, torturosity, and altered matrix composition, which suggests a generalized systemic weakness throughout the entire vasculature. The aim of this study was to determine whether this phenomenon was present in the venous tissue of patients with AAA.\nA segment of inferior mesenteric vein was harvested from patients who underwent aneurysm repair (n = 11) or colectomy for diverticulosis (n = 11; control). Matrix composition of the vessel was determined with stereology, and dimensions were measured with a computerized image analysis system. Stress-strain measurements were calculated with elongation of inferior mesenteric vein tissue with a tensile-testing machine.\nHistologic examination results showed fragmentation of elastin fibers within the medial layer of venous tissue obtained from patients with AAA. The medial elastin content in tissue from patients with aneurysms was 19.4%, compared with 26.8% in the control group (P =.018). Mechanical test results revealed a significant reduction in the tensile strength from 2.885 MPa in the control group to 1.405 MPa in the AAA group (P =.007). This reduction corresponded with a significant reduction of 59% in the stiffness of the vessel, with the mean Young's modulus of elasticity in the AAA group being 2.72 MPa, compared with 5.361 MPa in the control group (P =.0005).\nReduction in tensile strength and stiffness in venous tissue from patients with AAA was associated with disruption and reduction of the elastin content of the vein wall. These changes are analogous to those observed in the arterial aneurysmal wall and confirm the systemic nature of this disorder.",

The secondary objectives were to determine the biologic activity of NV1FGF on hemodynamic and clinical parameters associated with improved perfusion.\nFifty-one patients with unreconstructible peripheral arterial occlusive disease with rest pain or tissue necrosis underwent treatment with intramuscular NV1FGF. Increasing single (500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, and 16,000 microg) and repeated (2 x 500, 2 x 1000, 2 x 2000, 2 x 4000, and 2 x 8000 microg) doses of NV1FGF were injected into the ischemic thigh and calf. Arteriography was performed before treatment and was repeated 12 weeks after treatment. Side effects and serious adverse events were monitored. Measurements of plasma and urine levels were performed to evaluate NV1FGF plasmid distribution. Serum FGF-1 was measured as an analysis of gene expression at the protein level. Transcutaneous oxygen pressure, ankle brachial index, toe brachial index, pain assessment with visual analog scale, and ulcer healing also were assessed. The safety results are presented for 51 patients, and the clinical outcomes are presented for the first 15 patients (500 to 4000 microg) who completed the 6-month follow-up study.\nNV1FGF was well tolerated. Sixty-six serious adverse events were reported; however, none were considered to be related to NV1FGF. Four patients had adverse events that were possibly or probably related to the study treatment: injection site pain, pain, peripheral edema, myasthenia, and paresthesia. No laboratory adverse events were related to the study treatment. Two deaths remote from the treatment were considered not related. Biodistribution of plasmid was limited and transient in plasma and absent in urine. No increase in the FGF-1 serum level was detected. A significant reduction in pain (P <.001) and aggregate ulcer size (P <.01) was associated with an increased transcutaneous oxygen pressure (P <.01) as compared with baseline pretreatment values. A significant increase in ankle brachial index (P <.01) was seen.\nNV1FGF is well tolerated and potentially could be effective for the treatment of patients with end-stage limb ischemia. Biologic parameters indicate improved perfusion after NV1FGF administration. Dose response is not yet evident. The safety of NV1FGF and the magnitude of improvement observed in this study encourage further investigation with a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial.",

No laboratory adverse events were related to the study treatment. Two deaths remote from the treatment were considered not related. Biodistribution of plasmid was limited and transient in plasma and absent in urine. No increase in the FGF-1 serum level was detected. A significant reduction in pain (P <.001) and aggregate ulcer size (P <.01) was associated with an increased transcutaneous oxygen pressure (P <.01) as compared with baseline pretreatment values.

    "abstract": "Doxycycline has been shown to inhibit aneurysm formation in a rodent model of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The doses necessary for this inhibition (6 mg/kg) are much higher than the standard antibiotic doses (1 to 1.5 mg/kg) used in humans. Because the side effects associated with doxycycline are dose related, whether patients would tolerate doses that are four to six times higher than normal is unclear. Also unclear is whether the serum levels necessary in these animal models can be safely achieved in patients. The purposes of this study were to determine the serum concentrations necessary to inhibit aneurysm formation in a mouse model of AAA and to compare them with the plasma concentrations in patients with AAA with a standard dose of doxycycline.\nFour groups of 10 mice of C57BL/6 strain were given doxycycline (0, 10, 50, and 100 mg/kg) beginning at 7 weeks of age. At 8 weeks of age, the mice underwent AAA induction through bathing periadventitial aortic tissue with 0.25 mol/L CaCl(2). Blood samples were taken 10 weeks after surgery to assess the levels of doxycycline. Aortic size was measured at AAA induction and at death with a videomicrometer. Fourteen patients with diagnosed AAA were given 100 mg of doxycycline twice a day for at least 3 months. Blood samples to determine the plasma levels of the drug were taken at 3 or 6 months. The circulating levels of doxycycline for mice and humans were assessed with high-performance liquid chromatography.\nThe changes in aortic size and circulating levels of doxycycline in the AAA murine model are reported. Doses of 10, 50, and 100 mg/kg accounted for a 33%, 44%, and 66% reduction of the aneurysmal growth in the mice, respectively. In patients, the circulating doxycycline levels ranged from 1.8 to 9.42 microg/mL (mean, 4.14 +/- 0.557), values similar to those obtained in mice.\nThe circulating doxycycline levels of the patients are comparable with those achieved in mice. Doxycycline accounts for an inhibition of 33% to 66% of the aortic growth. The findings suggest that standard doxycycline doses could inhibit AAA growth in humans.",

    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases are enzymes capable of breaking down all of the components of the extracellular matrix and have been implicated in the development of aneurysm formation. Because matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels are elevated in aortic aneurysmal tissue and in that patient plasma, we hypothesized that plasma MMP-9 levels should decrease significantly after conventional and endovascular infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair but that plasma MMP-9 levels would remain elevated in patients with endoleaks.\nA sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure plasma levels of MMP-9 in patients with AAA who underwent conventional (n = 26; mean age, 71.5 years) and endovascular (n = 25; mean age, 76.4 years) AAA repair. Levels were drawn before surgery and at 1 month and 3 months after surgery. Eight patients for endovascular repair had endoleaks identified on postoperative computed axial tomographic scans.\nNo correlation existed between preoperative plasma MMP-9 levels when compared with age, gender, or aneurysm diameter. No significant difference in preoperative plasma MMP-9 levels or AAA diameter was identified between patients with conventional repair compared with endovascular repair. Of the 51 patients, 33 had follow-up samples available for analysis. A significant increase in mean plasma MMP-9 levels was noted 1 month (149.5 +/- 40.1 ng/mL) after conventional AAA repair compared with preoperative levels (83.9 +/- 26.1 ng/mL; P <.05) and remained elevated 3 months after surgery (129.8 +/- 56.6 ng/mL). In those patients who underwent endovascular aneurysm exclusion without endoleak, a significant decrease in mean plasma MMP-9 levels was noted at 3 months (27.4 +/- 5.2 ng/mL) when compared with preoperative values (60.8 +/- 8.8 ng/mL; P <.01). In contrast, patients with endoleak after endovascular exclusion did not have a significant decrease in plasma MMP-9 levels at 3 months.\nPlasma MMP-9 levels remain elevated for as much as 3 months after conventional AAA repair, whereas successful endovascular exclusion of an AAA results in decreased plasma MMP-9 levels by 3 months. MMP-9 may have clinical value as an enzymatic marker for endoleak after endovascular AAA exclusion.",

    "abstract": "This study tested the hypothesis that a subset of secondary infrainguinal arterial reconstructions show prohibitive failure rates.\nRecords of 79 consecutive patients, 44 men and 35 women, with a mean age of 60 years, who underwent secondary infrainguinal bypass from 1992 to 2000 at the University of Michigan Hospital, were reviewed. Data were analyzed with life-table analysis, logistic regression, and descriptive statistics.\nSecondary infrainguinal reconstructions were performed in patients who had undergone earlier ipsilateral bypasses once (n = 35) or twice (n = 44). Among the prior procedures, 68% (n = 54) were done at an institution other than the authors'. Comorbidities included coronary artery disease (72%), tobacco use (77%), and diabetes mellitus (34%), but no patient had hemodialysis-dependent renal failure. Disabling claudication, with average ankle brachial index of 0.48, had been the indication for the primary operation in 77% of cases. Femoral-popliteal bypass was the primary procedure in 67%, with a prosthetic graft used in 62%. The mean patency duration of these earlier bypasses was 25 months. The indication for the final bypass was rest pain or tissue loss in 51% of patients, with an average ankle brachial index of 0.37. The most common procedure was a femoral-distal bypass with autologous vein (63%). Mean patency duration of the secondary bypasses was 30 months. Graft failure within 30 days of operation occurred in 22 patients (28%), and amputation was necessitated in 86% of these patients. The presence of rest pain or tissue loss, when accompanied with a history of early prior graft thrombosis in female patients, correlated with worse mean patency rates, recurrent graft failure (P </=.05), and a 94% amputation rate. Men in a similar setting incurred a 57% amputation rate. No association of final patency existed with regard to age, number of prior bypasses, conduit types, tobacco use, or diabetes.\nSecondary infrainguinal bypasses are associated with an increased rate of graft failure and significant limb loss, particularly in those with a history of rest pain or tissue loss, female gender, and early prior graft failure. More appropriate initial operations in carefully selected patients and aggressive postoperative graft surveillance is speculated to improve these outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The importance of diabetes mellitus (DM) as an independent risk factor for perioperative cardiac morbidity after vascular surgery is controversial. This study examined the impact of DM on perioperative outcomes and length of stay in patients who underwent major vascular surgery.\nPatients who underwent elective aortic reconstruction (n = 2792), lower extremity bypass (n = 3838), carotid endarterectomy (n = 5522), and major amputation (n = 3883) from 1997 to 1999 were identified in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Outcomes assessed were death, cardiovascular complications (myocardial infarction, stroke, need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation), and length of stay. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to control for patient demographics, procedure type, comorbidities, and diabetic complications.\nBefore adjustment for potential confounders, patients with diabetes had a higher incidence rate of perioperative death (3.9% versus 2.6%; P =.001) and cardiovascular complications (3.3% versus 2.6%; P =.01) when compared with patients without diabetes. After controlling for comorbid conditions, procedure type, and diabetic complications, only patients with DM who underwent treatment with insulin were at statistically increased risk for cardiovascular complications (odds ratio [OR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.91). Neither DM treated with insulin (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.41) nor DM treated with oral medications (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.73-1.28) was an independent risk factor for death. Important independent risk factors for death included several conditions that are commonly associated with diabetes, including proteinuria, elevated creatinine level, history of congestive heart failure, and history of cerebrovascular accident. DM was also found to increase length of stay by as much as 38% even after adjustment for comorbidities.\nPatients with diabetes have a higher incidence rate of death and cardiovascular complications. However, after controlling for specific comorbid conditions, the only independent association was between patients with insulin treatment and the risk of cardiovascular complications. DM does not appear to be an independent risk factor for postoperative mortality. All patients with diabetes, regardless of insulin use, have a prolonged length of stay after major vascular surgery.",

Important independent risk factors for death included several conditions that are commonly associated with diabetes, including proteinuria, elevated creatinine level, history of congestive heart failure, and history of cerebrovascular accident. DM was also found to increase length of stay by as much as 38% even after adjustment for comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of polestriding exercise (walking with modified ski poles with a movement pattern similar to cross-country skiing) to increase exercise tolerance of persons with intermittent claudication pain caused by peripheral arterial disease was tested in this 24-week prospective randomized clinical trial.\nThe study was conducted in a Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital with 52 individuals who gave written informed consent and were randomized into either a polestriding exercise (n = 27; age, 65.5 +/- 7.0 years; ankle brachial index, 0.64 +/- 0.25) or nonexercise control (n = 25; age, 68.6 +/- 8.9 years; ankle brachial index, 0.69 +/- 0.14) group (P >.05 for all comparisons). The polestriding exercise program consisted of supervised training three times per week for 4 weeks, two times per week for 8 weeks, one time per week for 4 weeks, biweekly for 4 weeks and unsupervised training for 4 weeks. Starting in week 5, subjects took their poles home with instructions to repeat the most recent supervised training walk at an appropriate and convenient location near their residence. This was referred to as unsupervised but directed exercise. Subjects were provided with a personal log book for documenting unsupervised exercise sessions. With both supervised and unsupervised exercise, subjects were expected to complete a total of four 30-minute to 45-minute polestriding exercise sessions per week. The main outcome measures were exercise duration on symptom-limited incremental treadmill test, Walking Impairment Questionnaire, rating of perceived leg pain at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks, and constant work-rate treadmill exercise tests at baseline and at 4, 12, and 24 weeks.\nPolestriding significantly (P <.001) improved exercise tolerance on the constant work-rate and incremental treadmill tests. Ratings of perceived claudication pain were significantly less after the polestriding training program. Subject perceived distance and walking speed scores on the Walking Impairment Questionnaire improved in the polestriding trained group only (P <.001 and.022, respectively).\nThis randomized clinical trial provides empirical evidence that 24 weeks of polestriding training significantly improves quantitative and qualitative measures of the exercise tolerance of persons limited by intermittent claudication pain.",

    "abstract": "Dilated common iliac arteries that complicate aortic aneurysm stent grafting usually have been managed with endograft extension across the iliac artery bifurcation with internal iliac artery (IIA) occlusion. We studied 25 patients with significant common iliac artery (CIA) dilation treated with two methods: endograft extension across the iliac bifurcation or a new approach with a flared cuff within the CIA that preserves the IIA.\nOf 86 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) who underwent bifurcated endovascular stent grafting (ESG), 25 (29.1%) had at least one dilated CIA. Two treatment groups had different methods of management of iliac artery dilation. Group 1 underwent ESG with straight extension across the iliac bifurcation and IIA coil embolization before the ESG procedure (n = 2) or simultaneously with ESG (n = 8). Group 2 underwent ESG with flared distal cuff (AneuRx, Medtronic AVE, Santa Rosa, Calif) contained within the CIA, the so-called \"bell-bottom\" procedure, thus preserving the IIA (n = 15). Iliac artery dimensions, operating room time, fluoroscopy time, and postoperative complications were prospectively gathered.\nTwo women and 23 men had mean diameters of AAA of 56.6 mm (range, 38 to 98 mm) and of CIA of 21.4 mm (range, 15 to 48 mm). The diameters of CIA treated with device extension into external iliac artery after IIA coil embolization in group 1 and with the bell-bottom procedure in group 2 were not different (mean CIA diameter, 19.9 mm; range, 15 to 26 mm; and mean, 19.1 mm; range, 15 to 24 mm; respectively). However, significantly lower operating room and catheter procedure times were found in group 2 compared with group 1 (137 versus 192 minutes; 58 versus 106 minutes; P =.02 and.02, respectively). No periprocedural type I endoleaks were found in either group. Nine patients in group 2 also had a second contralateral CIA aneurysm, and five patients (mean CIA diameter, 33.0 mm; range, 22 to 48 mm) underwent treatment with extension across the iliac artery bifurcation and IIA occlusion. Use of the bell-bottom procedure on the other side allowed preservation of one IIA. Four cases (mean diameter, 19.3 mm) also underwent contralateral bell-bottom procedure. Two of these group 2 patients had complications, with severe buttock claudication in one and distal embolism necessitating limb salvage bypass after preoperative coil embolization of the IIA in another.\nSignificant CIA ectasia or small aneurysm is often associated with AAA. In such cases, the bell-bottom procedure that preserves IIA circulation is a new alternative to the common practice of placement of endograft extensions across the iliac artery bifurcation in patients with at least one CIA diameter of less than 26 mm. Additional benefits include reduced total procedure time. Early technical success appears to justify continued use. However, long-term evaluation is necessary to determine durability because the risk of rupture as the result of potential expansion of the excluded iliac artery or late failure is unknown.",

    "abstract": "Aortoaortic tube graft repair was the first technique used for the endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). However, progressive changes in the morphology of the distal aortic neck may be responsible for procedural failure. This study examines the use of aortoaortic tube prostheses and analyzes the factors that contributed to their failure and the methods used for their subsequent repair.\nDuring a 7-year period, 462 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms underwent endovascular aortic aneurysm repair. Of these, 65 patients (14%) underwent treatment with aortoaortic tube endoprostheses. Aortoaortic tube prostheses used included Talent (n = 44) (Medtronic-Worldmedical, Sunrise, Fla), Vanguard (n = 8) (Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass), EVT/Ancure (n = 4) (Guidant, Menlo Park, Calif), and physician-fabricated (n = 9). All the tube graft procedures were performed in the operating room with fluoroscopic guidance. The average age of patients for aortoaortic tube grafts was 74.5 years, and 48 of the patients were men. Failure was defined as aneurysm expansion, any type I endoleak, or type II endoleak persistent after 6 months.\nNo aneurysm ruptures or perioperative deaths were seen. Retrograde aneurysm perfusion from lumbar or inferior mesenteric arteries (type II endoleak) that persisted beyond 6 months was present in three patients. Proximal attachment site endoleaks were present in two patients. No distal implantation site endoleaks were present within 1 month of the initial endovascular repair; however, endoleaks at the distal attachment site developed in 12 patients subsequently and included all graft types (Talent, n = 6; Vanguard, n = 2; Ancure/EVT, n = 1; physician-fabricated, n = 3). The average time interval to failure was 12.9 months. Preoperative distal aortic neck length showed a significant correlation with the subsequent development of distal endoleak (endoleak, 16.6 +/- 6.8 versus no endoleak, 23.3 +/- 9.6; P =.03). Preoperative distal aortic neck diameter, however, did not show significance (23.8 +/- 5.2 versus 22.6 +/- 4.7; P = not significant).\nEndovascular aortoaortic tube grafts are vulnerable to failure even when initial exclusion of the aneurysm is successful. A significant association is seen between distal neck length and eventual failure. Because of the propensity toward eventual failure, the use of aortoaortic tube grafts in the infrarenal aorta cannot be recommended for typical fusiform aneurysms, even when an adequate distal neck appears to be present.",

The average time interval to failure was 12.9 months. Preoperative distal aortic neck length showed a significant correlation with the subsequent development of distal endoleak (endoleak, 16.6 +/- 6.8 versus no endoleak, 23.3 +/- 9.6; P =.03). Preoperative distal aortic neck diameter, however, did not show significance (23.8 +/- 5.2 versus 22.6 +/- 4.7; P = not significant).",

    "abstract": "Splanchnic arterial occlusive disease is rare in childhood. The purpose of this study was to review the clinical relevance and operative treatment of these lesions in a unique experience from a single institution.\nSeventeen children (11 boys and 6 girls) from 2 years to 17 years in age with critical narrowings of the celiac artery (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) underwent treatment at the University of Michigan from 1974 to 2000. Etiologic factors included embryologic fusion abnormalities of the fetal aortae during formation of the splanchnic arteries (n = 15), inflammatory aortoarteritis (n = 1), and radiation-induced arterial fibrosis (n = 1). Individual lesions included CA occlusions (n = 6) and stenoses (n = 7), SMA occlusions (n = 3) and stenoses (n = 11), and inferior mesenteric artery stenosis (n = 1). Fourteen children had abdominal aortic coarctations, and 15 had renal artery stenoses. Two patients had postprandial abdominal discomfort and food aversion, consistent with intestinal angina. Small stature affected five others, perhaps attributable to severe renovascular hypertension and failure to thrive. Ten children underwent intestinal revascularization, at the time of an aortoplasty or thoracoabdominal bypass for aortic coarctation (n = 7) or at the time of renal artery revascularization (n = 8). Primary splanchnic revascularization procedures included SMA-aortic implantation (n = 3), aorto-SMA and CA bypass with an internal iliac artery graft (n = 3) or a saphenous vein graft (n = 1), CA-aortic implantation at a stenotic SMA origin (n = 2), and CA and SMA intimectomy (n = 1). Secondary operations included SMA-aortic implantation (n = 2).\nAll 10 children who underwent splanchnic revascularization have thrived, gained weight, and are free of abdominal pain, with follow-up periods averaging 9 years. No intestinal ischemic manifestations occurred in the seven children who did not undergo operation.\nPediatric splanchnic arterial occlusive disease is a rare illness appropriately treated with operation in properly selected children.",

    "abstract": "Questions remain concerning the optimal site of graft origin and the extent of revascularization necessary to achieve excellent results for chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI). Endovascular therapy also is performed for CMI. These factors prompted us to review our results to provide a current standard.\nNinety-eight patients who underwent operation for CMI from 1989 to 1998 were reviewed. Patients with acute ischemia and arcuate ligament syndrome were excluded.\nSeventy-six women (78%) and 22 men (22%), with an average age of 66 years (range, 36 to 87 years), participated in the study. Abdominal pain was present in 95 patients (97%), and weight loss in 92 patients (94%). The superior mesenteric artery was severely diseased (70% to 99% stenosis or occlusion) in 90 patients (92%), the celiac artery in 81 patients (83%), and both arteries in 76 patients (78%). Bypass grafts were performed in 91 patients (93%), 77 antegrade and 14 retrograde. Of the other seven patients, five had endarterectomies, one reimplantation, and one patch angioplasty. Multivessel reconstruction was performed in 79 patients (81%), and single-vessel reconstruction in 19 (19%). Twelve patients had concomitant aortic reconstruction. Three early graft thromboses were seen. Five hospital deaths occurred (5.1%); one case had concomitant aortic reconstruction (1/12 versus 4/86; P = not significant). All five patients who died were older than 70 years (5/41 versus 0/57; P =.011). The median follow-up period was 1.9 years (range, 0 to 9.6 years). Follow-up was complete in all survivors. The 1-year, 5-year, and 8-year survival rates were 83%, 63%, and 55%, respectively. These rates were worse than the rates of the age-matched/gender-matched control subjects (P <.001). Survival was worse in patients greater than 70 years of age (P =.0013). Survival was unaffected by the number of vessels revascularized. The patients with retrograde grafts had decreased median survival rates (4.0 versus 5.7 years; P =.026), but they were older (75 versus 65 years; P =.0013). The 1-year and 5-year symptom-free survival rates were 95% and 92%, respectively. Symptoms recurred in six patients (6%): four had recurrent stenosis/occlusion and two had patent grafts. Symptom-free survival was unaffected by the number of vessels revascularized or by graft orientation.\nOperation for CMI was successful for most patients, with low operative mortality and excellent long-term relief of symptoms. Selective concomitant aortic procedures did not increase mortality rates. The rate of symptomatic recurrences was not different for single-vessel versus multiple-vessel reconstructions or for antegrade versus retrograde grafts. Patients older than 70 years had increased operative mortality and decreased survival rates. Endovascular therapy may be appropriate for this subset of patients.",

    "abstract": "Aortic reconstructions for primary graft infection (PGI), mycotic aneurysm (MA), and aortic graft-enteric erosion (AEE) bear high morbidity and mortality rates, and current treatment options are not ideal. Cryopreserved grafts have been implanted successfully in infected fields and may be suitable for abdominal aortic reconstructions. Registry data from several institutions were compiled to examine results of cryopreserved aortic allograft (CAA) placement.\nThe experience of 31 institutions was reviewed for CAAs inserted from March 4, 1999, to August 23, 2001. Indications for CAA, organisms, mortality, and complications were identified.\nFifty-six patients, 43 men and 13 women, with a mean age of 66 years (range, 44 to 90 years) had in situ aortic replacement with CAA. Indications for CAA placement were PGI in 43 patients (77%), MA in seven (14%), AEE in four (7%), and aortic reconstruction with concomitant bowel resection in two (4%). Infectious organisms were identified in 33 patients (59%); the most frequent organism was Staphylococcus aureus in 17 (52%). Thirty-one patients (55%) needed an additional cryopreserved segment for reconstruction. The mean follow-up period was 5.3 months (range, 1 to 22 months). One patient died in the operating room, and the 30-day surgical mortality rate was 13% (7/56). Seven additional patients died during the follow-up period, yielding an overall mortality rate of 25% (14 patients). Two patients (4%) had graft-related mortality as the result of hemorrhage from the CAA and persistent infection. Graft-related complications included persistent infection with perianastomotic hemorrhage in five patients (9%), graft limb occlusion in five (9%), and pseudoaneurysm in one (2%). Three patients (5%) needed amputation.\nIn situ aortic reconstruction with CAA in infected fields carries a high mortality rate, but most deaths are not the result of allograft failure. However, CAA infection and lethal hemorrhage caused by graft rupture occurs and is concerning. Early reinfection was not reported. Late graft-related complications, such as reinfection, thrombosis, or aneurysmal changes, are unknown. Preliminary data from this registry fail to justify the preferential use of CAA for PGI, MA, or AEE. A multicenter, randomized study is needed to compare results with established techniques.",

    "abstract": "Chronic venous stasis ulcers produce substantial morbidity rates and result in a significant expense to society. Fortunately, compression stockings (CS) have been found to reduce the rate of recurrence in patients with previous ulceration. Surprisingly, Medicare and other insurers do not reimburse the expense associated with CS or with patient education (Ed), which is essential to ensure compliance.\nA Markov decision analysis model was used for analysis of the cost-effectiveness of a strategy of reimbursement for CS and Ed (prophylaxis) versus one that does not supply these resources in a 55-year-old patient with prior venous stasis ulceration. The mean time to ulcer recurrence (53 months with CS+Ed; 18.7 months without prophylaxis), the mean time for ulcer healing (4.6 months), the probabilities of hospitalization (12%) and amputation (0.4%) after the development of an ulcer, and quality-adjustment factors (0.80 during ulcer treatment) were derived from the literature. The cost of CS ($300/year) and Ed ($93 for initial evaluation; $58/year; $40/recurrence) and the medical cost of ulcer treatment (average cost, $1621/recurrence) were calculated from our hospital cost accounting system.\nA strategy of CS and Ed was cost saving, with 0.37 quality-adjusted life years and $5904 saved, compared with a strategy that does not provide these resources. The inclusion of loss of revenue related to absence from work in the analysis increased cost savings to $17,080 during the patient's lifetime. With sensitivity analysis, CS and Ed remained cost-effective (lifetime cost per quality-adjusted life year saved, <$60,000) if amputations and the cost of ulcer treatment were eliminated or if the cost of prophylaxis was increased to 600% of the base-case. The mean time to recurrence in patients with CS and Ed needed to be reduced from 53 months to 21.1 months before this strategy was no longer cost-effective.\nProphylactic CS and Ed in patients with prior venous stasis ulceration are cost saving, even with the most conservative of assumptions. Insurers should routinely reimburse for these interventions.",

With sensitivity analysis, CS and Ed remained cost-effective (lifetime cost per quality-adjusted life year saved, <$60,000) if amputations and the cost of ulcer treatment were eliminated or if the cost of prophylaxis was increased to 600% of the base-case.

    "abstract": "Development of a femoral artery pseudoaneurysm occurs in 0.6% to 3.2% of interventional procedures. Nonsurgical treatment has consisted of ultrasound scan-directed compression and, more recently, direct thrombin injection into the pseudoaneurysm cavity to achieve thrombosis. Reported complications after thrombin injection are rare. We report two cases of femoral venous compression associated with pseudoaneurysm injection and review the literature. A 76-year-old man and an 86-year-old man both underwent thrombin injection of pseudoaneurysms compressing the ipsilateral common femoral vein. Both patients were diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis and subsequently needed surgical exploration for repair of the pseudoaneurysm and release of the venous compression. At exploration, both were found to have significant inflammation surrounding the femoral vessels, which made vessel exposure challenging. Because of the venous outflow obstruction involved in femoral pseudoaneurysms with secondary venous compression and the surgical difficulty caused by surrounding inflammation, avoidance of thrombin injection in favor of early surgical intervention is suggested.",

    "abstract": "The in situ vein (ISV) bypass is uniquely suited to technical modifications designed to reduce the wound morbidity of infrainguinal revascularization. A technique of \"blind\" valvulotomy and selective vein branch ligation was used, and a preliminary study was performed to assess safety and efficacy.\nFrom November 1998 to July 2001, all patients for infrainguinal bypass procedures underwent evaluation for inclusion in the study. Thirty-five patients underwent ISV bypass procedures with an expandable, self-centering valvulotome (ESV). Intraoperative selection of veins suitable for the study was assisted with venography and duplex scanning. The ISV bypass procedures were performed with initial groin and distal incisions, with smaller incisions to ligate significant arteriovenous fistulae (AVF). Duplex graft scanning was performed at routine intervals after surgery.\nThirty-seven ISV grafts were performed from the common femoral artery to the popliteal (n = 14), tibial (n = 20), and dorsalis pedis (n = 3) arteries. In 35 cases (95%), a full-length incision was avoided. With ESV, all valves in 34 cases (92%) were effectively lysed. Proximal extension of the distal incision was performed in four cases (10.8%). The mean number of incisions per case was 3.1 +/- 1.7. One graft failed within 30 days (2.7%), with successful revision. During the early follow-up period (9.9 +/- 7.3 months; range, 1 to 33 months), 44% of residual AVF closed spontaneously (15 of 34 AVF; 16 patients) and two anastomotic stenoses and two symptomatic AVF were corrected surgically. Four late graft occlusions occurred, with a 1-year cumulative primary patency rate of 77% and a secondary patency rate of 92%.\nBlind valvulotomy with ESV facilitates safe and effective minimally invasive ISV bypass. Resultant graft patency rates appear comparable with results with open techniques. This preliminary experience warrants further study to refine patient selection criteria and operative technique and to better clarify the natural history of residual AVF.",

We describe a technique in which a prosthetic graft is used as an external iliac artery conduit to facilitate the passage of the endograft delivery catheter/sheath and after completion of the endovascular portion of the procedure, a surgical bypass is completed with anastomosis of the graft to the hypogastric artery.",

    "abstract": "Infection of prosthetic vascular access grafts is the second most common complication of vascular access and represents a challenge encountered by the vascular surgeon. Anaerobic graft infections are rare. We report on a case of a prosthetic vascular access graft infection with Clostridium perfringens. To our knowledge, only one other case with an infected arteriovenous shunt caused by C perfringens has been reported. The patient, a 67-year-old woman with end-stage renal failure as the result of polycystic renal disease, was seen with an infected pseudoaneurysm at the arterial puncture site of the loop graft on the left arm. There was associated purulence at the time of operation. Surgical management consisted of complete graft removal because of the presence of small tunnel abscesses. C perfringens was found in the resected pseudoaneurysm and graft material. Infected pseudoaneurysms most likely are attributable to repetitive punctures in one small area and to a break in sterile technique. A compromised vascular supply, not infrequent in patients for hemodialysis, may lower the oxidation reduction potential, which allows anaerobic bacteria, such as C perfringens, to cause infection.",

We present a case of a patient after right radical mastectomy and radiation therapy for breast cancer with severe ischemic symptoms of the dominant right upper extremity. Angiography revealed an occluded right subclavian artery with a paucity of distal collaterals across the right shoulder. A reversed vein graft was constructed from the right common carotid artery to the right brachial artery and was tunneled with a retrohumeral approach to avoid the previously operated and irradiated field. The patient has remained asymptomatic with a patent graft at 2 years.",

    "abstract": "Internal iliac artery aneurysms (IIAs) are rare but can be the source of considerable morbidity when rupture occurs. IIAs have traditionally been treated with direct surgical exclusion or ligation. More recently, the advent of endovascular techniques have been adapted to treat isolated common and IIAs in lieu of elective surgical correction. This case report describes an 81-year-old patient with multiple medical problems and a symptomatic IIA, initially diagnosed with computed tomographic scan. Arteriography results showed extravasation of contrast from a left IIA. The aneurysm was treated with endovascular exclusion, with multiple coils in the IIA followed by placement of a covered stent within the common and external iliacs to exclude the orifice of the IIA. The patient tolerated the procedure well, and at 2 months after the procedure, no endoleak was present on follow-up computed tomographic scan results. At 12 months postprocedure, the patient has remained well. This case shows that endovascular therapies may offer a good treatment option in symptomatic or ruptured IIA, particularly in a patient who is at poor operative risk.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged limb ischemia followed by reperfusion (I/R) is associated with a systemic inflammatory response syndrome and remote acute lung injury. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC), achieved with repeated brief periods of I/R before the prolonged ischemic period, has been shown to protect skeletal muscle against ischemic injury. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether IPC of the limb before I/R injury also attenuates systemic inflammation and acute lung injury in a fully resuscitated porcine model of hind limb I/R.\nThis prospective, randomized, controlled, experimental animal study was performed in a university-based animal research facility with 18 male Landrace pigs that weighed from 30 to 35 kg. Anesthetized ventilated swine were randomized (n = 6 per group) to three groups: sham-operated control group, I/R group (2 hours of bilateral hind limb ischemia and 2.5 hours of reperfusion), and IPC group (three cycles of 5 minutes of ischemia/5 minutes of reperfusion immediately preceding I/R). Plasma was separated and stored at -70 degrees C for later determination of plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 with bioassay as markers of systemic inflammation. Circulating phagocytic cell priming was assessed with a whole blood chemiluminescence assay. Lung tissue wet-to-dry weight ratio and myeloperoxidase concentration were markers of edema and neutrophil sequestration, respectively. The alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient and pulmonary artery pressure were indices of lung function.\nIn a porcine model, bilateral hind limb (I/R) injury significantly increased plasma interleukin-6 concentrations, circulating phagocytic cell priming, and pulmonary leukosequestration, edema, and impaired gas exchange. Conversely, pigs treated with IPC before the onset of the ischemic period had significantly reduced interleukin-6 levels, circulating phagocytic cell priming, and experienced significantly less pulmonary edema, leukosequestration, and respiratory failure.\nLower limb IPC protects against systemic inflammation and acute lung injury in lower limb I/R injury.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of rifampin-bonded gelatin-sealed and silver acetate/collagen-coated knitted polyester prostheses for the prevention of bacteremic graft infection in an animal model.\nEighteen 6.0-mm polyester grafts (length, 5.0 cm) were implanted in dogs end-to-end into the infrarenal aorta. The dogs were divided into four groups as a function of type of prosthesis implanted. The dogs in groups I (n = 3) and II (n = 3) received control gelatin-sealed or collagen-coated polyester prostheses, respectively. In group III (n = 6), the dogs received rifampin-bonded gelatin-sealed polyester prostheses. In group IV (n = 6), the dogs received silver/collagen-coated polyester prostheses. Two days after implantation, the grafts were challenged with 6 x 10(9) Staphylococcus aureus intravenously. One week after implantation, the grafts were harvested with sterile technique. Quantitative cultures were obtained from all the harvested grafts. The results were expressed as colony-forming units per cm(2) of graft material. Bacteriologic study was also performed on various tissue samples. The chi(2) test was used to compare the culture proven infection of control and antimicrobial grafts.\nAll the control grafts were infected with S aureus at the time of removal. Five of the six silver/collagen-coated grafts were infected, whereas none of the six rifampin-bonded gelatin-sealed grafts grew S aureus (P <.01). There was no significant difference in the number of positive culture results of organ samples between the different groups of dogs.\nThese results indicate that rifampin-bonded gelatin-sealed polyester grafts are significantly more resistant to bacteremic infection than are silver/collagen-coated polyester grafts in a highly challenging model.",

This study investigates the differential effects of dexamethasone on rat and human smooth muscle cell migration and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity.\nRat aortic smooth muscle cells were harvested from Sprague-Dawley rats. Human aortic smooth muscle cells were obtained from Clonetics. Boyden chamber migration assays were performed with chemoattractant (platelet-derived growth factor) and varying concentrations of dexamethasone (10(-9) to 10(-5) mol/L). Zymography of culture media was used to assess MMP activity, and Western blot analysis was used for quantification of MMP-2 and tissue inhibitor of MMP-2 (TIMP-2) secretion.\nDexamethasone inhibits rat aortic smooth muscle cell migration in a dose-dependent fashion. An increase in concentrations of dexamethasone does not effect human aortic smooth muscle cell migration. Rat aortic smooth muscle cell MMP-2 activity is inhibited with dexamethasone in a dose-dependent fashion, and human aortic smooth muscle cell MMP-2 activity is unchanged with dexamethasone. MMP-2 secretion is inhibited with dexamethasone in rat aortic smooth muscle cells but remains unaltered in human aortic smooth muscle cells.

    "abstract": "We have shown that centrosome redistribution to the front of the cell and actin microfilament remodeling occurs during the initiation of early porcine aortic endothelial wound repair even before cell migration. Because Ras homologous protein (Rho) induces actin microfilament polymerization, interacts with microtubules, and is believed to be activated by growth factors, we set forth to study the regulatory roles of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and Rho signaling on centrosome redistribution and actin microfilament remodeling in endothelial cells at an in vitro wound edge.\nWith double immunofluorescent confocal microscopy, we studied the distribution of various cytoskeletal proteins in wounded porcine aortic endothelial cells in response to bFGF and exoenzyme C3 treatments.\nWe showed that the addition of 10 ng/mL bFGF for 3 hours after wounding resulted in a significant increase (P <.05) in cells at the wound edge with central microfilaments oriented perpendicular to the wound. Rho inhibition with 2 microg/mL C3 resulted in the reduction of phosphotyrosine, paxillin, and central microfilament staining. Centrosome redistribution and endothelial cell elongation also were significantly inhibited (P <.05) with C3, resulting in decreased wound closure. However, inhibition was reduced with coincubation of bFGF with C3, which also returned the rate of endothelial wound closure toward control values. This Rho-independent bFGF-induced centrosome redistribution was associated with the cells showing a significant increase (P <.05) in acetylated microtubules that extended from the centrosome to the posterior cell border.\nWe conclude that Rho regulates centrosome redistribution and central microfilament remodeling during early endothelial wound repair, and bFGF promotes actin remodeling through a downstream Rho-dependent pathway and promotes centrosome redistribution, at least in part, with a Rho-independent pathway.",

    "abstract": "The retinoblastoma gene product is a cell cycle control protein that when inhibited allows cell proliferation to progress by releasing E2F. Retinoblastoma manipulation has been attempted to prevent intimal hyperplasia (IH) in injured native vessels by arresting vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. However, no studies have identified the role, if any, of retinoblastoma in anastomotic IH formation after prosthetic arterial grafting. The goal of this study was to describe the relation of retinoblastoma and E2F to anastomotic IH with analyzing retinoblastoma/E2F levels, retinoblastoma phosphorylation, and transcription of retinoblastoma and E2F in prosthetic arterial grafting.\nSix-mm-diameter expanded polytetrafluoroethylene carotid interposition grafts (n = 12) were implanted in 25-kg mongrel dogs. The intervening arterial segments were harvested as controls. The distal anastomoses were harvested at 14 and 30 days after implantation for immunoblot, messenger RNA (mRNA), and immunohistochemistry analyses. Tissue homogenate was separated with sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed with antibody to total retinoblastoma, phosphorylated retinoblastoma at serine 795, serine 780, and serine 807/811, and E2F-1. Bands at each time point were quantitated and compared with control artery (n = 12). Each lane was standardized with reprobing with antibody to beta-tubulin. Immunohistochemistry was performed with antibody to retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma and E2F mRNA expression levels in anastomotic IH and control artery were analyzed with an oligonucleotide microarray.\nTotal retinoblastoma, from immunoblot analysis, was decreased at the 14-day and 30-day distal anastomoses by 35.7% and 33.6%, respectively, compared with control (P <.01). Furthermore, retinoblastoma at these time points was unphosphorylated at phosphorylation sites serine 795, serine 780, and serine 807/811. E2F-1 levels at 14 days and 30 days were unchanged compared with control. Positive staining for retinoblastoma was seen in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell from control, 14-day, and 30-day tissue. A qualitative decrease appeared to be seen in retinoblastoma in the neointima at 14 and 30 days compared with the native wall. No differential expression of retinoblastoma and E2F mRNA was seen in anastomotic IH compared with control.\nThis study showed that total retinoblastoma levels are decreased and E2F-1 levels remain unchanged in anastomotic IH. Attenuated retinoblastoma is a novel concept to anastomotic IH after prosthetic arterial grafting. Retinoblastoma/E2F imbalance may not be the result of transcriptional regulation and may increase unbound E2F to promote cell proliferation. Hypophosphorylation of remaining retinoblastoma may minimize uncontrolled proliferation by preventing further increases in unbound E2F. Therefore, retinoblastoma/E2F imbalance may lead to the early but limited increase in cell proliferation seen after prosthetic arterial grafting and appears to contribute to the development and progression of anastomotic IH.",

    "abstract": "The potential beneficial effects of red wine consumption on the development of atherosclerotic disease have been previously suggested in the literature. Vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation is an important component of atherogenesis. Inhibition of vascular SMC proliferation may have a beneficial effect in retarding the development of atherosclerotic disease. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of red wine, red wine polyphenol extract, and resveratrol, a polyphenol commonly found in red wine, on the proliferation of vascular SMC in culture.\nBovine aortic SMCs were used for all experiments. SMCs were treated with growth media supplemented with dealcoholized red wine, red wine polyphenol extract, or resveratrol at various concentrations for as long as 48 hours. SMC proliferation was assessed with (3)H-thymidine DNA incorporation assay. SMC viability was assessed with trypan blue exclusion studies and a colorimetric lactic dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assay.\nOur results show that red wine and red wine polyphenol extract inhibit SMC proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion. Resveratrol also inhibits vascular SMC proliferation. SMC viability studies show that this inhibition of SMC proliferation is not the result of a cytotoxic effect.\nOur findings show that red wine and red wine polyphenols have an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of vascular SMCs in culture. These results suggest that the observed beneficial effects of red wine may be the result, in part, of the inhibition of vascular SMC proliferation. Furthermore, the antiproliferative properties of red wine may be caused by its component polyphenols.",

    "abstract": "The current status and future needs of peripheral endovascular utilization and training have not been well defined. This topic is particularly relevant to the future of four specialties: interventional cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, interventional radiology, and peripheral vascular surgery. We attempt to analyze the current numbers of cardiovascular patients and procedures and the numbers of treating physicians and surgeons to make predictions and recommendations for the future.\nThe numbers of cardiovascular patients and procedures were obtained from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Trend Query web site. The number of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs was obtained with telephone or e-mail contact with the aortic endograft manufacturers. The numbers of different cardiovascular specialists were obtained with contact with different cardiovascular professional societies and the American Board of Specialists via telephone, e-mail, or web site. The numbers of accredited US cardiovascular fellowship programs and first year spots were obtained from the Graduate Medical Education Directory 2000 to 2001. Finally, the numbers of endovascular fellowship programs and first year spots were obtained with contact with the individual programs.\nThe numbers of cardiovascular patients and procedures have risen from 1993 to 1997. This trend is expected to continue as the population ages. Despite the rapid rise of endovascular procedures, the number of open cases has continued to rise as well. However, the number of cardiovascular specialists is predicted to remain stable. Specific numbers and trends are depicted in the manuscript.\nOur analysis shows that a critical shortage of endovascular trained specialists will exist in the future. More surgeons need to receive endovascular training to meet these future needs.",

    "abstract": "The correlation of B-mode ultrasonographic morphology with histologic characteristics of atherosclerotic carotid plaques remains ill-defined. The classification of plaques with recently reported measures of plaque echogenicity and heterogeneity has been unsatisfactory. We used computer-assisted duplex ultrasound (DU) scan image analysis to determine echogenicity of specific tissues in control subjects. This information was used to quantify each tissue in imaged carotid plaques with pixel distribution analysis (PDA). These objective observations then were quantitatively compared with plaque histology in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.\nWe performed standardized DU scanning of healthy tissues in 10 volunteer subjects and of 20 carotid artery plaques (7 symptomatic and 13 asymptomatic) in 19 patients with carotid stenosis. The plaques underwent histologic analysis after carotid endarterectomy. The grayscale intensity ranges of blood, lipid, fibromuscular tissue, and calcium were calculated in the control subjects. With computer-assisted image analysis, B-mode images of plaques were linearly scaled to normalize data. Pixel distribution within the images then was analyzed. The grayscale ranges of known tissues obtained from control subjects helped define the amount of intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid, fibromuscular tissue, and calcium within carotid plaque images. This analysis was correlated with tissue composition measurements on histologic sections of excised plaques.\nThe median grayscale intensity (range) in control subjects was 2 (0 to 4) for blood, 12 (8 to 26) for lipid, 53 (41 to 76) for muscle, 172 (112 to 196) for fibrous tissue, and 221 (211 to 255) for calcium. PDA-derived predictions for blood, lipid, fibromuscular tissue, and calcium within carotid plaques correlated significantly with the histologic estimates of each tissue respectively (blood: P =.012; lipid: P =.0006; fibromuscular: P =.035; and calcium: P =.0001). A significantly higher amount of blood and lipid was seen within symptomatic plaques compared with asymptomatic ones (P =.0048 and P =.026, respectively). Conversely, a larger amount of calcification was noted within asymptomatic plaques (P =.0002).\nComputer-assisted PDA of DU scan images accurately quantified intraplaque hemorrhage, fibromuscular tissue, calcium, and lipid. Symptomatic plaques had lower calcium content but larger amounts of intraplaque hemorrhage and lipid. Quantitative PDA may be used to determine carotid plaque tissue composition to assist in the identification of symptomatic and potentially unstable asymptomatic plaques.",

    "abstract": "Many thromboembolic events occur in patients taking aspirin. Dual therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel may prove effective at reduction of thromboembolic complications. However, the extent to which these two drugs interact may significantly increase the risk of bleeding in open surgery. Because of the increased use of combination antiplatelet therapy in populations with significant atherosclerotic disease, this risk needs to be evaluated by the assessment of the combined effect in vivo of clopidogrel and aspirin on bleeding time and platelet function.\nIn seven healthy subjects, addition of low dose clopidogrel (2 x 75 mg) to aspirin (150 mg) therapy significantly increased bleeding time (from 7.6 +/- 3.4 minutes to 17.5 +/- 8.6 minutes; P <.05), with concomitant falls in adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet fibrinogen binding and aggregation (P <.05). Increasing the dose of clopidogrel to 300 mg increased bleeding time (to 24.9 +/- 8.5 minutes; P <.05) without significant additional platelet inhibition. There was considerable variability in the individual subject platelet response to the lower dose of clopidogrel. Those patients with the highest ADP response at baseline had the least response, and subjects with a weak response to ADP at baseline achieved maximal platelet inhibition with the low dose of clopidogrel.\nThe increases in bleeding times should be considered in combination antiplatelet therapy in patients who undergo open vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "Long saphenous vein (LSV) stripping in the treatment of varicose veins may reduce the recurrence of varices but may also increase morbidity rates. The effect of stripping on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of LSV surgery, with and without successful stripping, on HRQoL.\nThis prospective study comprises 102 consecutive patients who underwent varicose vein surgery that included attempted stripping of the LSV to the knee. HRQoL was assessed before surgery and at 4 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years after surgery with the Aberdeen varicose vein severity score (AVSS; disease-specific) and the Short-Form 36 (SF-36; generic). Patients defined as stripped were those in whom complete thigh stripping to the knee was confirmed with postoperative duplex scanning at 2 years. Patients defined as incompletely stripped were those in whom any LSV remnant was found in the thigh after surgery. Deep venous reflux (DVR) was defined as reflux of 0.5 seconds or more in at least the popliteal vein.\nSixty-six of 102 patients (65%) provided complete HRQoL data at all four time points. At baseline, there was no significant difference between patients who were stripped (n = 25) and incompletely stripped (n = 41) in terms of AVSS, SF-36, age, gender, DVR, or CEAP grade. Significantly more patients in the incompletely stripped group underwent surgery for recurrent disease (29/41, 71%, versus 8/25, 32%; P =.002, with chi(2) test). Both groups gained significant improvements in AVSS scores for as much as 2 years. After adjustment for recurrent disease, stripping conferred additional benefit in terms of AVSS at 6 months (median [interquartile range]) (9 [4 to 16] versus 15 [9 to 24]; P =.031) and 2 years (7 [2 to 10] versus 9 [5 to 15]; P =.014), which was statistically significant in patients without preoperative DVR but not significant in patients with preoperative DVR. SF-36 scores were not affected by stripping.\nLSV surgery leads to a significant improvement in disease-specific HRQoL for as much as 2 years. In patients without DVR, stripping to the knee confers additional benefit.",

The subjects were 286 patients from 30 clinical sites with saphenous vein reflux as measured with duplex scanning. A total of 319 limb treatments were performed. Intervention included endovenous catheter obliteration of insufficient saphenous veins with temperature controlled radiofrequency heat, without high ligation of the saphenofemoral junction. The main outcome measures were status of occlusion of treated vein segments, presence of varicose veins and reflux, clinical symptoms scores, physician evaluation of procedure success, and patient satisfaction.\nAt 12 months, 83.6% of treated limbs were classified as CO, 5.6% were categorized as NCO, and 10.8% were recanalized. At 24 months, 85.2% of treated veins were CO, 3.5% were NCO, and 11.3% were recanalized. Varicose veins were present in 95% of limbs before treatment. The presence of varicose veins in limbs with CO was 10.5%, 7.3%, 5.7%, and 8.3% at 1 week, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months, respectively. The presence of varicose veins in NCO limbs was similar at each interval. Overall, 91.4% of 232 limbs followed to 12 months and 90.1% of 142 limbs at 24 months were free of saphenous vein reflux, regardless of technical outcome. Paresthesia was reported in 3.9% of limbs at 1 year and in 5.6% at 2 years. The pretreatment mean symptom severity score was 2.0. Mean posttreatment symptom scores decreased to 0.07, 0.0, and 0.50 for CO, NCO, and recanalized limbs, respectively, at 6 months. At 12 months, the mean scores were 0.06, 0.0, and 0.32 for CO, NCO, and recanalized limbs, respectively; at 24 months, the scores were at 0.10, 0.40, and 0.63. Patient satisfaction was achieved in 195 of 212 patients (92%) at 1 year and in 121 of 128 (94.5%) at 2 years.\nEndovenous vein obliteration without high ligation dramatically reduces the presence of varicosities and reflux and, when performed with the prescribed pull-back methodology, is comparable with vein stripping at 1 and 2 years. Patient satisfaction with the procedure is high at 2 years, regardless of technical outcome. At 2 years, the closure procedure is a viable alternative to stripping.",

    "abstract": "Postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) develops in 40% to 60% of patients with deep venous thrombosis. Factors that are important in the development of PTS include venous reflux, deep vein obstruction, and calf muscle pump dysfunction (CMD).\nReflux and CMD in relationship to the severity of PTS were evaluated in a 2-year follow-up study of patients with acute deep venous thrombosis. Duplex scanning was used to measure reflux. The supine venous pump function test (SVPT) measures CMD with strain-gauge plethysmography. The base-line examination was performed within 1 to 5 days after diagnosis. The next examinations were scheduled at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.\nThe study included 86 legs, and the 2-year follow-up period was completed for 70 legs. Significantly more reflux was found in previously thrombosed vein segments, with an odds ratio of 1.8 after 3 months, of 2.1 after 6 months, of 2.5 after 12 months, and of 3.2 after 24 months. Multiple regression results showed that the most important risk factor for early clinical signs of PTS was superficial reflux in months 3, 6, and 12 (P < or =.02). Deep reflux did not have a synergistic relationship with superficial reflux in correlation with the clinical signs of PTS. The SVPT was not able to predict the development of PTS.\nMore reflux develops in previously thrombosed vein segments. As early as after the third month, patients with superficial reflux have an increased risk of development of the first clinical signs of PTS. Within 2 years, the SVPT shows no relationship with clinical signs of PTS.",

    "abstract": "For patients with Stanford type B aortic intramural hematoma (IMH), medical treatment is usually selected. However, the outcomes of patients with type B IMH are not completely understood, and some cases can have fatal complications develop or surgical treatment necessitated. The purpose of this study was to investigate predictors of progression of the affected aorta in patients with type B IMH with initial computed tomography (CT) images.\nThirty-five patients with type B IMH were studied with serial CT images. Initially, medical therapy was selected for all patients. CT findings of the affected aorta were evaluated on admission and at follow-up. We divided the patients into two groups (progression group or regression group) on the basis of CT findings and investigated predictors of progression of the affected aorta with initial CT images.\nWe defined 15 patients who showed increased maximum aortic diameter (n = 14), increased maximum aortic wall thickness (n = 3), progression to overt dissection (n = 4), or rupture of the aortic wall (n = 2) during the follow-up period as the progression group. The other 20 patients, who all showed decreased maximum aortic wall and aortic wall thickness, were defined as the regression group. In the maximum aortic diameter, an optimal cutoff value of 40 mm resulted in positive predictive and negative predictive values of 86.7% and 90.0%, respectively. Both a maximum aortic diameter of 40 mm or more (P =.0011) and a maximum aortic wall thickness of 10 mm or more (P =.0009) were shown to be significantly predictive of the progression with Cox regression analysis.\nMaximum aortic diameter and maximum aortic wall thickness on initial CT images are predictive for progression of the affected aorta in patients with type B IMH. For type B IMH with a maximum aortic diameter of 40 mm or more or a maximum aortic wall thickness of 10 mm or more, careful follow-up studies must be required.",

    "abstract": "The mortality rate for elective repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms is as low as 4% in some surgical centers. However, patients with emergent presentation with acute pain, rupture, or complicated acute dissection traditionally have a poor outcome. We evaluated the results of surgery in a large contemporary series of patients with acute presentation at a tertiary referral center with a special interest and experience in aortic surgery.\nBetween 1986 and 1998, 1220 patients underwent repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. One hundred twelve patients had acute presentation, and 1108 patients underwent elective repair. Data were collected in a prospectively generated database.\nSeventy-six patients had rupture, and 36 patients had acute dissection without rupture. The operative mortality rate was 6% for elective cases and 17% for acute cases (P =.0004). The long-term survival was longer for the elective group compared with the acute group (mean, 8.3 +/- 0.4 years versus 5.5 +/- 0.7 years; P <.005). Age did not influence survival rate in the acute group. Postoperative pulmonary complications, paraplegia/paraparesis, and renal impairment occurred in 45%, 14%, and 25%, respectively, of acute cases and were significantly more common than in elective cases (P < or =.01). Left heart bypass was used in 34 acute patients (30%), and intercostal arteries were reattached in 66 acute patients (59%). Surgery without the use of either adjunct was associated with significantly higher mortality and renal impairment rates.\nRepair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms with acute presentation is associated with worse outcome compared with elective cases. Nevertheless, repair may be performed with reasonable mortality and morbidity rates at specialized centers. In the acute setting, the use of surgical adjuncts is associated with improved outcome and should be used when possible. Age does not impact on survival rate in patients with acute presentation, and surgery should not be restricted to only younger patients.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe our experience with endoluminal graft repair of a variety of thoracic aorta pathologies with a commercially developed device currently under investigation. Our patient population included patients eligible for open surgical repair and those with prohibitive surgical risk.\nFrom February 2000 to February 2001, endovascular stent-graft repair of the thoracic aorta was performed in 46 patients (mean age, 70 years; 29 male and 17 female patients) with the Gore Excluder. Twenty-three patients (50%) had atherosclerotic aneurysms, 14 patients (30%) had dissections, three patients (7%) had aortobronchial fistulas, three patients (7%) had pseudoaneurysms, two patients (4%) had traumatic ruptures, and one patient (2%) had a ruptured aortic ulcer. Patient characteristics, procedural variables, outcome, and complications were recorded. All patients were followed with chest computed tomographic scans at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Follow-up period ranged from 1 month to 15 months, with a mean of 8.5 months.\nAll the procedures were technically successful. There were no conversions. Average duration of the procedure was 120 minutes. Average length of stay was 6 days, but most patients (64%) left the hospital within 4 days after endoluminal grafting. The overall morbidity rate was 23%. Two patients (4%) had endoleaks that necessitated a second procedure for successful repair. Two patients (4%) died in the immediate postoperative period. There were no cases of paraplegia. At follow-up examination, one patient had an endoleak found the day after the procedure and another patient had an endoleak 6 months after the procedure. Both cases were treated successfully with additional stent-grafts. There were no cases of migration. One patient died of a myocardial infarction 6 months after graft placement. In patients treated for aneurysm (n = 23), the aneurysm diameter ranged from 5.0 to 9.5 cm (mean, 6.8 cm). Residual sac measurements were obtained at 1, 6, and 12 months, with mean sac reductions of 0.59 cm, 0.77 cm, and 0.85 cm, respectively. In three cases, the sac remained unchanged, without evidence of endoleak.\nThoracic endoluminal grafting with the Gore Excluder is a safe and feasible alternative to open graft repair and can be performed successfully with good results. Early data suggest an endoluminal approach to these disease entities may be favorable over classical resection and graft replacement.",

Previously reported cases were obtained with a Medline search.\nSeven ruptures were found with Guidant/EVT devices. Five of these occurred among the 686 patients in US Food and Drug Administration protocols (group I) who were followed for a mean of 41.8 +/- 21.9 months and limited to the subgroup of 93 first generation tube endografts. Two ruptures occurred in group II (3260 patients after market approval with limited follow-up), specifically in the subgroup of 166 patients who underwent treatment with second generation tube grafts. No ruptures were found in patients with bifurcation or unilateral iliac implants followed for a mean of 37.5 months. All ruptures were caused by distal aortic type I endoleaks on the basis of attachment system fractures (first generation devices only), aortic neck dilatations, persistent primary endoleaks, migration, overlooked imaging abnormalities, refused reintervention, and poor patient selection. The mortality rate was 57% (4/7) overall and was 50% for surgical repair (3/6). A literature search identified 40 additional ruptures related to other devices, for a total of 47. All 44 that were documented with adequate data were caused by endoleaks (26 type I, 2 type II, 11 type III, and 5 source not reported). Other contributing factors were graft module separation and graft wall deterioration. The overall mortality rate for the combined series was 50%, with an operative mortality rate of 41%.\nPostendograft AAA rupture is infrequent, although the true incidence rate is unclear because of inadequate follow-up of individual device designs. Tube endografts should be limited to the rare patient with ideal anatomy, no other alternatives, and at high risk for standard open repair. Prevention of aneurysm rupture requires long-term surveillance with attention to subtle imaging abnormalities and the establishment of reliable follow-up protocols for specific devices.

Computerized perioperative data have been supplemented with a retrospective review of hospital charts/outpatient records and a telephone canvass to calculate survival rates and the incidence rate of subsequent graft-related complications. Seventy-four patients (6.5%) were lost during a median follow-up period of 57 months for the entire series.\nThe 30-day mortality rate was 1.2%. The hospital course was completely uneventful for 939 patients (83%), and the median length of stay for all patients was 8 days. A total of 196 patients had single (n = 150; 13%) or multiple (n = 46; 4%) postoperative complications, which were more likely to occur in men (odds ratio [OR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 5.2) and in patients with a history of congestive heart failure (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.7 to 7.8), chronic pulmonary disease (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.9), or renal insufficiency (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3 to 4.7).

    "abstract": "Despite well-documented good early results and benefits of endoluminal stent graft repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (J Vasc Surg 2002;35:1137-44.)(AAA), the long-term outcome of this method of treatment remains uncertain. In particular, concern exists that late effectiveness and durability are inferior to that of open repair. To determine the incidence and causes of clinical failures of endovascular AAA repair, a 7-year experience with 362 primary AAA endografts was reviewed.\nClinical failures were defined as deaths within 30 days of the procedure, conversions (early and late) to open AAA repair, AAA rupture after endoluminal treatment, or AAA sac growth of more than 5 mm in maximal diameter despite endograft repair. Endoleak status per se was not considered unless it resulted in an adverse event. If clinical problems arose but could be corrected with catheter-based therapies or limited surgical procedures, thereby maintaining the integrity of successful stent graft treatment of the AAA, such cases were considered as primary assisted success and not classified as clinical failures.\nThe average follow-up period was 1.5 years. Six deaths (1.6%) occurred after the procedure, all in elderly patients or patients at high risk. Five patients (1.4%) needed early conversion (immediate, 2 days) to open repair for access problems or technical difficulties with deployment, resulting in an implantation success rate of 98.6%. Eight patients (2.2%) underwent late conversion for a variety of problems, including AAA expansion (n = 4), endograft thrombosis (n = 1), secondary graft infection (n = 2), and rupture at 3 years (n = 1). Rupture occurred in an additional two patients for a total incidence rate of 0.8%. AAA sac growth of greater than 5 mm was observed in 20 patients (5.6%), four of whom have undergone successful catheter-based treatments to date. Overall, 39 patients (10.7%) needed catheter-based (n = 45) or limited surgical (n = 4) reinterventions for a variety of late problems that were successful in 92%.\nIn our 7-year experience, one or more clinical failures of endovascular AAA repair were observed in 31 patients (8.3%). Reinterventions were necessitated in a total of 10.7% of patients but were usually successful in maintaining AAA exclusion and limiting AAA growth. These results emphasize that endovascular repair provides good results and many benefits for most properly selected patients but is not as durable as standard open repair.",

    "abstract": "The Talent endovascular graft has been used in the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in more than 13,000 patients worldwide. However, information regarding the results of its use has been limited. This report describes the experience with 368 patients with AAAs who underwent treatment at four medical centers as part of an investigator-sponsored investigational device exemption trial.\nPatients with AAAs were enrolled at four sites during a 32-month period from January 1999 to July 2001. All patients underwent treatment for infrarenal AAA with the Talent endovascular graft. Repair was performed with transrenal stent fixation under epidural (362/368 patients; 98.3%), local (4/368 patients; 1.1%), or general (2/368 patients; 0.5%) anesthesia. The average diameters were: maximum aortic aneurysm, 6.2 +/- 1.2 cm; proximal aortic fixation site, 2.6 +/- 0.4 cm; and distal iliac fixation site, 1.4 +/- 0.6 cm. Bifurcated grafts were used in 276 of 366 patients (75%), aortouniiliac in 57 of 366 patients (16%), and tube aortoaortic in 33 of 366 patients (9%). Multiple comorbid medical conditions were present in all patients (average, 4.7 conditions/patient). The mean age was 75.8 years, and 85% of the patients were male. Follow-up period ranged from 2 to 33 months (mean, 7.3 months).\nEndovascular graft deployment was accomplished in 366 of 368 patients. In the 263 patients followed for at least 6 months after endovascular repair, AAA diameter decreased by 5 mm or more in 83 patients (32%); diameter remained unchanged (change < 5 mm) in 157 patients (60%) and increased by 5 mm or more in 23 patients (8.7%). Major morbidity occurred in 46 of 368 patients (12.5%), and minor morbidity occurred in 31 of 368 (8.4%). The 30-day mortality rate was 1.9%. Secondary procedures were performed in 32 patients (8.7%). Late rupture occurred in two patients, and late deaths unrelated to AAA occurred in 32 patients (8.7%) during the follow-up period. The primary technical success rate for all patients was 93.4%. The 30-day primary procedural success rate was 73.3%. The 30-day secondary procedural success rate was significantly higher at 85.8%. Computed tomographic scan was performed within 1 month after surgery in 349 patients. An endoleak was present in 43 of 349 patients (12.3%). These endoleaks were comprised of 10 attachment site (type I; 2.9%), 31 retrograde side-branch (type II; 8.9%), and two transgraft (type III; 0.6%).\nThese midterm findings show a high degree of technical and procedural success achieved in a patient population with extensive comorbid medical illnesses with low perioperative morbidity and mortality rates. Further follow-up study will be necessary to determine the effectiveness of the Talent endograft for the long-term treatment of AAA.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is associated with a risk of cerebral ischemia during carotid clamping, particularly in the face of contralateral internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion. We examined the results of CEA with continuous electroencephalography in patients without and with contralateral ICA occlusion.\nWe reviewed 564 primary CEAs with routine electroencephalography and general anesthesia performed between April 1, 1989, and March 31, 1999, in a community teaching medical center. Main outcome measures were perioperative stroke, temporary lateralizing neurologic deficit, and death. Shunts were placed primarily for significant electroencephalographic changes after carotid clamping but also selectively for contralateral ICA occlusion, prior stroke, or surgeon choice. CEA was performed for asymptomatic disease in 35% of cases.\nSignificant electroencephalographic changes occurred in 16% versus 39% (P <.001) and shunts were placed in 13% versus 55% (P <.001) of patients with patent (n = 507) versus occluded contralateral ICA (n = 57), respectively. The fraction of CEAs with significant electroencephalographic changes during clamping was stable, but shunt use declined slightly over time as our confidence in electroencephalography increased. Patches were placed more often (86% versus 65%; P =.002), but other operative details were similar when the contralateral ICA was occluded. Five early (30 days) strokes (0.9%) and eight early temporary postoperative neurologic events (1.4%) occurred, all ipsilateral to CEA and all after the patient left the operating room with none in patients with contralateral ICA occlusion. Two perioperative deaths occurred, one in a patient without and one in a patient with contralateral ICA occlusion. Neither of these deaths was related to ipsilateral stroke. No increase in stroke rate with decreased shunt use over time was seen.\nRoutine use of electroencephalography was associated with apparent complete elimination of intraoperative strokes and less than 1% risk of perioperative strokes. These observations appear to be true even in the face of contralateral ICA occlusion. Electroencephalography is a sensitive detector of cerebral ischemia and a valuable tool for determination of need for shunting during CEA. Surgeons should consider routine use of electroencephalography and selective shunting for significant electroencephalographic changes with clamping.",

Five early (30 days) strokes (0.9%) and eight early temporary postoperative neurologic events (1.4%) occurred, all ipsilateral to CEA and all after the patient left the operating room with none in patients with contralateral ICA occlusion. Two perioperative deaths occurred, one in a patient without and one in a patient with contralateral ICA occlusion. Neither of these deaths was related to ipsilateral stroke. No increase in stroke rate with decreased shunt use over time was seen.",

    "abstract": "The endovascular approach to external iliac artery (EIA) disease extending into the common femoral artery (CFA) has been avoided because of problems with stent placement across the inguinal ligament. Surgical treatment for this disease distribution includes extensive endarterectomy or bypass procedures or both. We report our initial experience with a combined open and endovascular approach to these patients.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent intraoperative EIA stenting after CFA endarterectomy/patch angioplasty between 1997 and 2000. Stents were positioned to end at the proximal endarterectomy endpoint, without crossing the inguinal ligament. Technical success, hemodynamic success, and clinical success were determined according to Society of Vascular Surgery/International Society of Cardiovascular Surgery criteria. Life-table analysis was performed for patency.\nThirty-four patients (mean age, 68 years; 23 male, 11 female) had combined endovascular and open treatment of iliofemoral occlusive disease. Indications were claudication in 41% and critical limb ischemia in 59%. Femoral reconstruction included endarterectomy with patch angioplasty in all patients. EIA stent deployment incorporated the stenotic iliac segment and the proximal endpoint of the endarterectomy in all patients. Four patients (12%) also needed common iliac angioplasty at the same time for proximal iliac disease, and 14 patients (41%) also needed distal revascularization for associated femoropopliteal or tibial disease. Technical success and hemodynamic success were achieved in 100% of patients. Clinical success was achieved in 97% of patients. The mean postoperative increase in ankle-brachial index in patients with inflow procedures only was 0.36 (range, 0.1 to 0.85). The overall complication rate was 15%. With a mean follow-up period of 13 months (range, 0.5 to 28 months), 1-year primary patency and primary-assisted patency rates were 84% and 97%, respectively. No perioperative mortality was seen.\nEIA stenting as an adjunct to CFA endarterectomy/patch angioplasty allows for more localized surgery than conventional bypass. This approach also allows a better interface between the stent and endarterectomy than staged preoperative stenting. Technical success and early patency rates are excellent.",

    "abstract": "Lower extremity revascularization is indicated for limb salvage and incapacitating leg claudication. Many risk factors (age, hypertension, diabetes, tobacco use, dyslipidemia, etc) have been associated with atherosclerosis and the development of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. However, whether these risk factors or the surgical indication (claudication or limb salvage) influences the extent and location of infrainguinal disease and hence the target artery (distal anastomosis) is unclear. This study examines the risk factors and indication for infrainguinal revascularization with respect to the type of bypass performed.\nThree hundred fifty-two infrainguinal revascularizations in 282 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Patient data, including demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, indications, types of revascularization, and perioperative complications and mortality, were collected. Data were analyzed with t test, chi(2) test, Fisher exact test, and multiple logistic regression.\nThe indication for surgical revascularization was claudication in 70 patients and limb salvage in 282. The likelihood of a popliteal anastomosis (above or below knee) versus a tibial or pedal anastomosis was decreased with increasing age (P =.002) and diabetes (P =.0001), and smoking increased the likelihood (P =.056). However, popliteal bypass also was strongly associated with claudication as the surgical indication (odds ratio [OR], 8.7; P =.0001), and 90% of the claudicant group had undergone popliteal anastomosis. Claudication and popliteal anastomosis were both linked to smoking; 97% of subjects who underwent operation for claudication were smokers compared with 75% of subjects who underwent tibial or pedal anastomosis for limb salvage (P =.001). After adjustment for indication, the likelihood of popliteal anastomosis was still decreased with diabetes (OR, 0.46; P =.002), and age had a borderline significant effect (P =.077). When the analysis was stratified by indication for surgery, the likelihood of popliteal bypass among patients who underwent operation for claudication was not influenced by age, diabetes, or smoking. However, within the subset of patients who underwent operation for limb salvage, the likelihood of any popliteal anastomosis was diminished by diabetes (OR, 0.50; P =.007), age (OR, 0.968 per year; P =.01), and chronic renal insufficiency (OR, 0.476; P =.04).\nInfrainguinal peripheral arterial occlusive disease is not a homogenous disease entity. Claudication and limb salvage are associated with two distinct patterns of vascular disease with different risk factors. Patients who undergo operation for claudication are seen at an earlier age, have a high prevalence of smoking, and have proximal disease and a greater likelihood of a popliteal anastomosis. In contrast, patients for limb salvage are less likely to have a popliteal bypass, favoring a more distal target outflow anastomosis that is strongly influenced by advanced age, diabetes, and chronic renal insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "The purposes of this study were to evaluate the long-term results of different autogenous conduits used for infrainguinal bypass when ipsilateral greater saphenous vein (IGSV) is absent or inadequate and to determine the impact on the contralateral lower extremity.\nThe study was performed as a retrospective evaluation of a prospective vascular registry together with review of patient records and telephone follow-up.\nFrom January 1990 to June 2000, 226 autogenous infrainguinal reconstructions were performed in 203 patients without adequate IGSV. The patients consisted of 128 men and 98 women, with a mean age of 69 years. Prevalent risk factors included diabetes (51%) and prior coronary bypass (46%). Limb salvage was the predominant indication (93%), and 59% of the procedures were secondary reconstructions. All bypasses were completed with autogenous vein, which included contralateral greater saphenous vein (CGSV; 31%), single-segment lesser saphenous vein (5%), single-segment arm vein (19%), and autogenous composite vein (45%). Bypasses were performed to the tibial and pedal arteries in 84% of the cases. The 30-day mortality and graft occlusion rates were 1% and 9%, respectively. The overall postoperative morbidity rate was 24%, with a 7% rate of major complications. Follow-up was complete in 95% of patients over a mean period of 24 months (range, 0.1 to 106 months). The 5-year primary patency rates were significantly better for CGSV compared with autogenous composite vein grafts (61% +/- 7% versus 39% +/- 6%; P <.009).

Contralateral vein harvest and the presence of diabetes did not affect the need for bypass or amputation of the contralateral limb.\nFor most patients with inadequate IGSV, the CGSV is the alternative conduit of choice because of its length, superior performance, ease of harvest, and minimal risk to the donor limb.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed our initial thoracic aorta (TA) stent graft experience in 28 patients from the perspective of treatment with homemade devices (Dacron over Gianturco Z stents; 14 cases) and a commercial device (Excluder; W.L. Gore Co, Flagstaff, Ariz; 14 cases).\nFrom November 1996 to August 2001, 28 patients with a spectrum of disease (degenerative aneurysm, n = 18; chronic dissection, n = 4; pseudoaneurysm, n = 3, with 1 trauma and 2 anastomotic; intramural hematoma, n = 2; and coarctation, n = 1) underwent TA stent grafting. Clinical parameters included a mean age of 71 years, 12 female (43%) and 16 male (57%) patients, 14 of 28 patients (50%) with major comorbidities that prohibited open repair, and nine of 28 patients (32%) with urgent or ruptured conditions. Seven patients (25%) needed open surgical access to the aorta or iliac artery for either concomitant abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (n = 3) or device deployment (n = 4), and six of 28 patients (21%) needed left subclavian-carotid transposition to provide for an adequate proximal fixation site. Focal (<15 cm) grafts were used in 19 patients, and the remaining patients had at least two thirds of their descending aorta excluded.\nThe procedural mortality rate was 3.5% (1/28 patients); three additional deaths, (1 device-related) occurred during the mean follow-up period of 17 months. Access artery complications occurred in six of 28 patients (21%), with one fatal. No immediate or late open conversions were performed. One patient needed urgent dilation and stenting of a collapsed stent graft 3 weeks after deployment. Serious systemic complications included temporary dialysis (n = 1), congestive heart failure (n = 1), and unstable angina (n = 1). Complete exclusion of the TA lesion was noted in 27 of 28 cases (96%). No cases of spinal cord ischemia were noted. Ease and accuracy of deployment was superior for the second generation (commercial) device.\nTA stent graft repair, although in evolution, appears to be a safe and effective alternative to open repair for many patients with a spectrum of TA disease. Prospective trials for individual diseases will be necessary to define its ultimate role.",

Two weeks later, a small saccular aneurysm of the aortic arch was treated with open surgery. An unexpected intraoperative finding was retrograde dissection of the aortic arch and of the ascending aorta that was not seen on the postprocedural computed tomographic scans after endografting. The ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the proximal part of the descending thoracic aorta were successfully replaced with a Dacron graft with deep hypothermia, circulatory arrest, and retrograde cerebral perfusion. Awareness that this life-threatening complication that necessitates extensive cardiovascular surgery can occur not only during or immediately after endovascular stenting of the thoracic aorta but also as much as several days or perhaps even weeks after the procedure is important.",

    "abstract": "The lack of suitable experimental models of chronic severe limb ischemia and deficiencies in the available methods that allow for direct intermittent measurement of regional limb perfusion are obstacles to the evaluation of recently developed molecular strategies to reverse severe limb ischemia. Our aim was to develop a model of clinically relevant severe limb ischemia and correlate a simple direct measurement of muscle pO(2) to a clinical ischemia index, muscle mass, and capillary density.\nSevere hindlimb ischemia was induced in 44 adult rats with ligation of the left common iliac artery, the femoral artery, and their branches. The effect of ischemia on muscle pO(2) was measured in the left gastrocnemius with room air and with 100% oxygen at 3, 10, 24, and 40 days after ischemia was induced. Clinical ischemia index, muscle mass, cellular proliferation, and capillary density also were assessed.\nThe clinical ischemia index of the left limb was most severe at day 10, with evidence of pressure sores, a pale and dusky limb, and abnormal gait. With the rats breathing room air, muscle pO(2) was significantly lower in the left limbs than in the right limbs at days 3, 10, 24, and 40. After an oxygen challenge (100% O(2)), muscle pO(2) was significantly lower at 3, 10, and 40 days. At 3 days, the fraction of muscle mass per total body weight of the left tibialis anterior (TA) was significantly greater than the right TA as a result of edema and inflammation. By days 10, 24, and 40, the left gastrocnemius and TA masses were significantly less than the right as a result of muscle atrophy. Histopathology showed severe necrosis in the left gastrocnemius and TA on day 3. Inflammation was greatest by day 10. Necrotic muscle regenerated but remained atrophic at 40 days. The TA was slower to recover than the gastrocnemius. Capillary densities and capillary-to-muscle fiber ratios were greater in the ischemic limb than in the normal limb at day 24. Cellular proliferation as determined with bromodeoxyuridine labeling reagent staining was maximal in the ischemic limb at day 3.\nWe have developed a rat model of chronic severe hindlimb ischemia with persistent ischemia as shown with a simple direct measurement of muscle pO(2) for up to 40 days. This model of severe hindlimb ischemia may be applicable for future studies of molecular strategies to treat severe limb ischemia in humans.",

With electroporation, bovine aortic ECs were transfected with either the PAI-1 construct or the empty vector as control.

The effect of EC PAI-1 overexpression on SMC migration was measured with a modified Boyden-chamber assay. SMC MMP expression was measured with zymography.\nSelected clones (EC9, EC21) had a three-fold to five-fold increase in PAI-1 activity compared with untransfected EC and empty vector EC (ECC). Similarly, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results showed a 3.5-fold to 5.5-fold increase in PAI-1 levels in EC9 and EC21 versus ECC. Untransfected EC and ECC had similar effects on SMC migratory patterns. Migration of SMC exposed to PAI-1 overexpressing EC was inhibited by 35% to 57% compared with ECC. This inhibitory effect was reversed with addition of exogenous urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). Zymography showed downregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in SMCs exposed to PAI-1 overexpressing EC.\nPAI-1 overexpression with transfected EC inhibits SMC migration.

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common vascular degenerative disease. AAA wall contains inflammatory cells that produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that probably contribute to elastolysis and remodeling of the aneurysm. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to reduce the expression of various molecules (including MMPs) independently of their cholesterol-lowering effect. The aims of this study are to investigate whether statins could modulate the biology of AAA wall and have a potential therapeutic value against AAAs.\nWe performed immunohistochemical analysis, evaluated MMP-9 production in the aortic wall from patients with infrarenal AAA (n = 10) and control patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease (n = 8), and examined the effect of cerivastatin on MMP-9 production in the AAA wall with organ culture.\nNeutrophils and macrophages were the cellular sources of MMP-9 in the AAA wall. The tissue concentrations of both total and active MMP-9 were significantly higher in tissues from AAA walls than in control aortic walls. Cerivastatin (0.001 to 0.1 micromol/L) significantly reduced the tissue levels of both total and active MMP-9 in a concentration-dependent manner (P <.001), and the production of tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 was unaffected. Cerivastatin neither reduced the number of infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages nor enhanced apoptosis of those cells, as evaluated with terminal transferase-mediated deoxyurisine triphosphate nick end labeling.\nThese results suggest that cerivastatin can directly modulate the biology of the AAA wall and suppress MMP-9 production in the AAA wall by inhibiting the activation of neutrophils and macrophages, indicating that statin therapy could be useful for the prevention or treatment of AAA.",

    "abstract": "Migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) contributes to intimal hyperplasia in saphenous vein (SV) bypass grafts, which leads to patency-threatening stenosis. Evidence for the involvement of basement membrane-degrading matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and growth factors in mediating SMC migration and proliferation has been presented in a number of in vitro and in vivo models. 3-Hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely used in patients with atherosclerosis and are claimed to have additional effects beyond cholesterol reduction. We therefore examined the effects of simvastatin, a commonly prescribed statin, on the proliferation and migration of cultured human SV SMC and on neointima formation and MMP activity in human SV organ cultures. To clarify its mode of action, we studied in parallel the effects of a specific MMP inhibitor, marimastat.\nHuman SV specimens were obtained from patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, and were cultured for 14 days in the presence of three concentrations of simvastatin and subsequently processed for measurement of MMP activity and neointimal thickness measurements. Cultured SV SMCs were used to construct growth curves in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum or 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with simvastatin or marimastat. Migration through a Matrigel basement-membrane matrix (invasion) was quantified with modified Boyden chambers.\nSimvastatin dose dependently reduced neointima formation (P =.004) in association with reduced MMP-9 activity (P =.03). SMC proliferation and invasion also were inhibited with simvastatin (P <.007 and P <.009, respectively). Marimastat dose dependently inhibited SMC invasion (P <.001) but importantly had no effect on SMC proliferation (P >.36).\nFor effective control of neointimal development in vivo, a pharmacologic strategy should inhibit both SMC migration and proliferation. The ancillary properties of 3-Hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors typified by simvastatin may be important in this regard.",

    "abstract": "Early restenosis and the development of myointimal hyperplasia in stented blood vessels have been attributed to deep vascular injury with fracture of the internal elastic lamina (IEL). The purpose of this study was the evaluation of the vascular wall response to superficial injury (without IEL rupture) after balloon angioplasty and intravascular stent placement in porcine arteries and the determination of the effect of stent strut geometry on the degree of vessel injury and early restenosis.\nBalloon-expandable stainless-steel stents were placed into the iliac arteries of 10 Sinclair miniature swine that had been fed an atherogenic diet. A Palmaz stent, with rectangular struts and smooth corners, was randomly assigned to one iliac artery (group 1), and a novel stent, which was designed and manufactured in the laboratory with thicker struts and sharper corners specifically to induce large wall stress concentrations, was placed in the contralateral iliac artery (group 2). Intravascular ultrasound scan was used in all deployments to ensure accurate balloon sizing and to avoid stent overexpansion and deep vascular injury. At 90 days after implantation, the animals were killed, the stented vessels harvested, and histomorphometric analysis performed.\nDeployment of novel stents in group 2 resulted in a statistically higher incidence rate of deep vascular injury (fracture of the IEL) compared with group 1, despite identical balloon size used for deployment (with Student t test, P <.05). Vessels with deep injury showed a 10-fold increase in myointimal thickening compared with those vessels in which the IEL remained intact. A statistically higher restenosis rate was observed for group 2 (33.5% +/- 19.90%) compared with group 1 (20.39% +/- 14.70%). For both stent designs, there was a trend toward lower degrees of restenosis within the mid-portion of the stent. For superficially injured arteries in both groups, no correlation was observed between the amount of vessel wall/medial layer compression and the development of restenosis from myointimal hyperplasia.\nMaintenance of an intact IEL is an important factor in the prevention of myointimal hyperplasia and restenosis in stented porcine iliac arteries. The alteration of stent strut height and geometry does not significantly affect restenosis and the development of myointimal hyperplasia in vessels with superficial injury. Superficial injury elicits a response that is independent of stent strut geometry and vessel wall compression. Stent strut profile may, however, increase local vessel wall stress concentrations, leading to IEL rupture and an exaggerated response to injury.",

Vessels with deep injury showed a 10-fold increase in myointimal thickening compared with those vessels in which the IEL remained intact. A statistically higher restenosis rate was observed for group 2 (33.5% +/- 19.90%) compared with group 1 (20.39% +/- 14.70%). For both stent designs, there was a trend toward lower degrees of restenosis within the mid-portion of the stent. For superficially injured arteries in both groups, no correlation was observed between the amount of vessel wall/medial layer compression and the development of restenosis from myointimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism of venous pressure decrease during exercise still remains unclear. To explore the components involved with the regulation of ambulatory venous pressure, we reinvestigated the pattern of pressure decrease during tiptoe exercise with a newly developed mathematic model.\nSeventeen healthy limbs of 16 volunteers (normal group) and 35 limbs of 33 patients with signs and symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency were studied. Seventeen limbs had superficial venous incompetence (SVI), and 18 showed deep venous incompetence with or without concomitant superficial venous reflux. All subjects were examined with ambulatory venous pressure measurements. As parameters obtained from serial phasic changes in pressure during tiptoe movements, the pressure reduction fraction per step (decreasing component) and the pressure increase per step (increasing component) were calculated with application of the mathematic hemodynamic model and assessed comparatively in the three groups with different types of reflux (normal, SVI, and deep venous incompetence group).\nThe pressure increase per step was significantly different in each of the three groups (P <.0001, with analysis of variance), whereas no apparent difference was seen in the mean pressure reduction fraction per step among the groups. With addition of the inflation of ankle cuff, the value of pressure increase in limbs with SVI was significantly reduced (P =.0004, with Wilcoxon signed rank test), although no changes were seen in the pressure reduction fraction in each group.\nOur results indicate that the pressure reduction fraction, representing calf muscle pump function, is independent of the existence or site of valve incompetence. On the other hand, the pressure increase, corresponding to the degree of reflux during exercise, correlates strongly with the severity of venous insufficiency. The theoretic model can separate the two components responsible for ambulatory venous pressure changes, calf muscle pump function and venous reflux, and provide better understanding of venous hemodynamics.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop a protocol for evaluation of patients suspected of having deep venous thrombosis (DVT) who came to the hospital after normal noninvasive vascular laboratory (NIVL) working hours in an attempt to both retain registered vascular therapists and provide excellent patient care.\nWe developed a protocol for evaluation of patients suspected of having DVT who were seen at night after normal NIVL working hours (8 am to 9 pm). After exclusion of those with contraindications, all eligible patients either received low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH; 1 mg/kg) and were sent home or were placed at bedrest in the emergency department until the NIVL opened the following morning. Those sent home were given maps to the NIVL and told what time to report. Parameters examined were numbers of after-hours venous duplex ultrasonography (VDU) studies, patient morbidity and mortality, and RVT retention. We compared results from October 1, 1997, through September 30, 1998, the year before the program started, with those from October 1, 1998, through September 30, 2000, the 2 years after program implementation. Data were compared with chi(2) analysis.\nDuring the study period, 161 patients suspected of having DVT were seen at the NIVL after hours and were deferred for study until the morning. Eighty-eight patients received prophylactic LMWH and were sent home, and 73 patients were placed in observation. All had VDUs the next morning at 8 am. No deaths, pulmonary emboli, or immediate complications of anticoagulation therapy were seen. After implementation, we noted an 89% reduction in after-hours VDU studies. Before program implementation, four RVTs resigned during an 18-month period because of issues relating to excessive call. From 1998 through 2000, the NIVL had 100% retention of its nine RVTs.\nThe development of the LMWH program has reduced after-hours VDUs by 89% without causing patient morbidity or mortality. Retention of RVTs has been 100% since program implementation.",

Ultrasound scan-guided compression repair failed at least one time in 13 cases and was contraindicated in the four remaining cases. With ultrasound-Doppler scan guidance, the PCFPs were percutaneously punctured with a 16-gauge intravenous catheter. An angiogram was performed through the catheter to ensure its location within the sac. Stainless steel spring coils with synthetic fibers were introduced within the PCFP with fluoroscopic control. Successful thrombosis was checked with ultrasound-Doppler scan and was repeated at days 1, 30, and 180 when possible.\nAll PCFPs of 32-mm mean diameter were successfully treated with two to nine coils. After embolization, gentle additional compression was necessary for complete occlusion, with a mean duration of 6.3 minutes (range, 0 to 15 minutes), except in one case with treatment with abciximab in which it was 45 minutes. All procedures were uneventful and painless. The mean follow-up period was 9.5 months (range, 1 to 21 months). Two recurrences (11.7%) were observed, and one was successfully treated with a second embolization.\nPercutaneous embolization with coils appears to be a safe and effective method for treatment of PCFP. It may be performed in patients undergoing anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and must be attempted when ultrasound scan-guided compression repair has failed or is contraindicated.",

    "abstract": "Both supported and unsupported bifurcated endograft limbs develop flow-restricting lesions, including kinks, stenoses, and occlusions, which can be identified during or after surgery. Recognition and intervention are essential to achieve long-term graft patency and a satisfactory functional result. This report represents a comprehensive retrospective review of graft limb interventions from the Phase II EVT Trial with the Endovascular Grafting System unsupported bifurcated endograft (Guidant/EVT, Menlo Park, Calif).\nThe study population consists of 242 patients who underwent treatment with bifurcated endografts implanted during the EVT Phase II Trial. Graft limb interventions have been divided into two groups: those in whom the intervention occurred during surgery versus those in whom the intervention occurred after surgery. Parameters studied included type, incidence, and timing of graft limb intervention, indications for intervention, procedures performed, and overall patient outcome.\nThe mean follow-up period was 31 months. Primary, primary assisted, and secondary limb patency rates were 61.6%, 93.7%, and 97.1%, respectively. Technical success rate at case completion was 97.5%. In 68 of the 242 cases, limb interventions were performed during surgery to assure patency (28.1%). In 28 cases, interventions were performed after surgery (11.6%). Of these postoperative limb problems, 82% occurred during the first 6 months. Repeat limb interventions were necessitated in three patients (1.2%). Within the intraoperative intervention group, perceived indications included kinks (15%), stenosis (57%), dissection (6%), graft redundancy (12%), and instances of twists, thrombosis, and pressure gradients (10%). These findings were successfully managed with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty only (41%), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent (50%), and various combined interventions. Within the postoperative intervention group, symptomatic indications included stenosis (46%) and thrombosis/occlusion (54%). These postoperative limb events were successfully managed with stent (64%), thrombolysis (32%), and femoral-femoral bypass (21%). When limb dysfunction developed in the postoperative setting, it most often occurred within the first 6 months of implantation. Only one patient in this Phase II cohort had a lower extremity amputation unrelated to a graft limb abnormality.\nThe unsupported bifurcated limbs of this endograft necessitated primary adjunctive intervention in 40% of cases. Primary intervention was two times more likely to be performed at the time of the implant rather than after surgery. Repeat limb interventions were not common. Endograft limb flow problems were successfully treated with standard endovascular or surgical interventions or both. These data may support prophylactic stenting of unsupported Ancure graft limbs. A strategy that includes both intraoperative and early postoperative graft limb surveillance is essential to detect reduced limb flow.",

    "abstract": "Suboptimal iliac anatomy has sometimes precluded endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). In an effort to increase the applicability of endovascular repair, a limited retroperitoneal approach and iliac conduit was used in some patients with unsuitable iliac anatomy at high risk for open repair.\nCharts and imaging studies of 312 patients who underwent endovascular (AAA) repair at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation between June 1999 and November 2000 were reviewed. Among these, 22 patients with complex iliac anatomy had an iliac conduit placed. Seventeen of these procedures were planned, but five were unplanned and placed after an iliac artery injury. A group of 17 patients who underwent a standard endovascular repair without conduits was selected and matched to the 17 patients in the planned conduit group by baseline comorbidities. The conduits were 8-mm or 10-mm polyester grafts sewn proximally to the common iliac artery and provided unobstructed access to the aneurysm. After insertion of the endograft device through the conduit, the distal end of the conduit was anastomosed to the external iliac or common femoral vessels.\nOperative time and estimated blood loss were higher among patients in whom conduits were performed, especially when performed urgently as an unplanned procedure. Although operative time and intensive care unit and hospital stays were longer for the group of patients with iliac conduits, the cardiac pulmonary and renal complication rates were similar for the conduit and the standard endovascular repair group.\nThe use of a limited retroperitoneal approach and iliac conduit for patients with difficult iliac anatomy increases the applicability of the endovascular repair of AAA. This technique should be considered when an open surgical approach is inadvisable on the basis of medical comorbidities.",

Patent aortic side branches were identified with preprocedural spiral computed tomographic scanning and calibrated angiography. Coil embolization was performed before EVAR. Patients were followed up with plain radiographs and ultrasound and dual phase spiral computed tomographic scans. Digital subtraction angiography was performed when endoleak was suspected. The outcome measures were the incidence of type II endoleaks and changes in maximum aortic sac diameter (Dmax).\nForty patients underwent EVAR, with a median duration of follow-up of 24 months (range, 3 to 48 months). Before surgery, the inferior mesenteric artery was patent in 16 patients (45%) and the lumbar arteries in 21 patients (53%). Inferior mesenteric artery embolization was successful in 13 of 16 patients (81%). Lumbar embolization was attempted in 13 patients and was successful in eight (62%). During EVAR, successful sac exclusion was achieved in 38 patients (95%). None of the patients who underwent embolization before EVAR had type II endoleak develop, eight of 13 patients (62%) with patent lumbar arteries had endoleaks develop (P =.006), and three of these patients subsequently underwent successful coil embolization. Type II endoleak was associated with a 2.0-mm median increase in Dmax (P =.045). A 3.0-mm median reduction in Dmax was seen in the absence of type II endoleak (P =.002).\nType II endoleaks are predictable, preventable, and sometimes treatable. Significant sac shrinkage occurs in the absence of lumbar endoleak but not in the presence of type II endoleak.",

    "abstract": "Computed tomographic (CT) scan represents the criterion standard for surveillance of endoleaks after endoluminal repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (erAAAs). Given need for surveillance, risks, and expense of CT scan, the accuracy of color-flow duplex (CFD) scan after erAAA was determined.\nDuring a 43-month period, patients enrolled in phase II and III of the AneuRx Multicenter Clinical Trial at our institution underwent CFD scan 1 month after erAAA. Patients with CFD scan results that were positive for endoleak underwent CT scanning at 3 months after erAAA, and those with CFD scan results that were negative for endoleak underwent CT scanning at 6 months after erAAA.\nSeven of 79 patients (9%) who underwent CFD and CT scanning had the diagnosis of endoleak. All endoleaks that were diagnosed with CT scan were detected with CFD scan. One patient had positive results for endoleak with CFD scan at 1 month and then negative results with CT scan at 3 months. Although this may represent resolution of endoleak, this case was counted as a false-positive result. When compared with CT scan, CFD scan had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 99%, positive predictive value of 88%, negative predictive value of 100%, and accuracy of 99%.\nCFD scan is an accurate test for the detection of endoleak after erAAA. In addition, most endoleaks diagnosed with CFD scan at 1 month continued to be present at 6 months. This important finding increases the emphasis on the use of this noninvasive test and may initiate earlier intervention of endoleak.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the impact of walking impairment, cardiovascular risk factors, and comorbidity on quality of life (QOL) in patients with intermittent claudication (IC).\nThe prospective observational study was conducted in the setting of a vascular outpatient department of a teaching hospital. QOL was assessed in 200 consecutive patients with IC, with a reduced version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment Instrument-100. The reduced instrument assesses 17 facets of QOL within five domains (Physical and Psychological Health, Level of Independence, Social Relationships, and Environment). Age, gender, degree of IC, risk factors, comorbidity, as recommended by the Society for Vascular Surgery/North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery (SVS/ISCVS), and the presence of back, hip, or knee symptoms were analyzed as possible predictors of QOL. Multiple regression analyses were run with each of the QOL facets and domains as dependent variable. A probability value of less than.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\nMale gender was found to be a predictor of better scores for Energy and Fatigue and for Sleep and Rest. Women had more Negative Feelings. The presence of back, hip, or knee symptoms was a significant predictive value for many aspects of QOL. With more concomitant diseases, patients had lower scores on the facets of Overall QOL and General Health and of Energy and Fatigue and showed more dependence on medication and treatments. The degree of IC, as expressed in the SVS/ISCVS classification, was a statistically significant predictor of QOL on the domain Level of Independence and its facets Mobility, Activities of Daily Living, and Working Capacity and the facets Pain and Discomfort, Sexual Activity, and Transport. Hypertension was the second most important single predictor of QOL in patients with IC.\nQOL in patients with IC is only partially determined by the severity of walking limitation as expressed in the SVS/ISCVS classification. The significant impact of cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidity and the presence of back, hip, or knee symptoms on QOL should be recognized and taken into account in the treatment policy.",

We evaluated calf muscle ischemia during exercise in patients with claudication with near infrared spectroscopy.\nA Critikon Cerebral Redox Model 2001 (Johnson & Johnson Medical, Newport, Gwent, United Kingdom) was used to measure calf muscle deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb), oxygenated hemoglobin (O(2)Hb), and total hemoglobin levels and oxygenation index (HbD; HbD = O(2)Hb - HHb) in 16 patients with claudication and in 14 control subjects before, during, and after walking on a treadmill for 1 minute (submaximal exercise). These measures were repeated after a second maximal exercise in patients with claudication and after 7 minutes walking in control subjects. Near-infrared spectroscopy readings during maximal exercise were then compared with a model of total ischemia induced with tourniquet in 16 young control subjects.\nTotal hemoglobin level changed little during exercise in both patients with claudication and control subjects. HHb levels rose, and O(2)Hb level and HbD falls were more pronounced in patients with claudication than in control subjects after submaximal and maximal exercise. During maximal exercise, HbD fell markedly by a median (interquartile range) of 210.5 micromol/cm (108.2 to 337.0 micromol/cm) in patients with claudication compared with 66.0 micromol/cm (44.0 to 101.0 micromol/cm) in elderly control subjects and 41.0 micromol/cm (36.0 to 65.0 micromol/cm) in young control subjects (P <.001). This fall also was greater than the HbD fall induced with tourniquet ischemia at 90.8 micromol/cm (57.6 to 126.2 micromol/cm; P =.006).\nHemoglobin desaturation in exercising calf muscle is profound in patients with claudication, considerably greater even than that induced with three minutes of tourniquet occlusion.

    "abstract": "Most trials on the reliability of constant-load treadmill testing use one pair of treadmill settings (speed, grade) only. The question of whether the results can be applied to tests with different settings is left open. Also, claudication distances measured with differing settings are not comparable, rendering the comparison of the results from different trials difficult. This study evaluates the reliability of constant-load testing with various workloads and compares them with claudication distances achieved with walking at normal speed on level ground but also evaluates whether metabolic equivalent (MET) normalization can be used to translate the results of different treadmill tests into each other.\nFifteen patients with claudication underwent repeated treadmill testing with different treadmill settings, including speeds of 2.0, 3.2, and 4.0 km/h (1.25, 2.0, and 2.5 mph, respectively) and grades of 0% and 12%. The walking capacity was also tested on level ground with a speed chosen by the individual patient. Results of virtual treadmill tests with all possible combinations of the speeds and the grades used were predicted from real tests, with MET normalization. The relationship between real and predicted claudication distances was tested with regression modeling.\nReliability coefficients (RCs) for the absolute claudication distance (ACD) were superior to RCs for the initial claudication distance. RCs for ACD ranged between 0.61 and 0.95, with increasing values found with increasing workloads. The best coefficients for the regression of measured on predicted claudication distances were achieved with a model on the basis of a power function (r = 0.963). The model was only appropriate for the prediction of group mean results from clinical trials but cannot be applied to single patient data. For proof of concept, the model was tested with six published studies in which the claudication distances of a patient sample were double treadmill tested with different workloads. The result of the second test was predicted from the first test, and estimated and measured claudication distances were compared. The mean difference (all trials) was 7.9%, whereas the maximum difference amounted to 16.5%.\nFor an optimal treadmill test reliability, higher workloads should be used and ACD should be preferred over initial claudication distance. MET normalization provides the basis for the comparability of treadmill test results achieved with different test conditions.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of significant carotid stenosis, to identify risk factors increasing this prevalence, and to determine the risk of progression of stenosis, in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease who are neurologically asymptomatic.\nConsecutive patients who underwent evaluation in a vascular laboratory for peripheral arterial occlusive disease, who had no recent neurologic symptoms, were investigated.\nFrom July 1999 to December 2000, 620 patients underwent duplex scanning on one occasion, and 417 on two occasions. The average age was 72 +/- 10 years, and 61% were men. An occluded internal carotid artery was found in 4.8% of patients. The prevalence of a carotid stenosis >50% was 33% on the initial evaluation. Age of more than 70 years (P =.007), diabetes mellitus (P =.042), history of stroke (P =.011), and ankle/brachial index of less than 0.8 (P =.0006), were independently associated with carotid stenosis >50%. The odds ratio associated with each of these risk factors was similar. The prevalence of carotid stenosis >50% was 16%, 21%, 38%, 47%, and 44% for patients with no, one, two, three, and four risk factors, respectively.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was the report of the results of a consecutive series of carotid endarterectomy (CEA), performed by one surgeon and independently assessed by a neurologist, in which the achievability of selective early control of the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) was prospectively recorded.\nAll patients who underwent CEA by the surgical author between November 17, 1999, and November 15, 2001, were entered into a prospective study during which early selective exposure and clamping of the distal ICA were attempted (with initial avoidance of carotid bifurcation exposure and retraction), which allowed the remainder of the procedure (in patients without shunting) to be performed with ICA clamp protection and anticoagulation therapy. All the procedures were performed with local cervical block anesthesia, all the patients underwent a vein patch procedure, and, with one exception, cerebral angiography was not used. Major morbidity (stroke and myocardial infarction), mortality, and consecutiveness were independently verified by a neurologist.\n148 consecutive CEAs were performed. In 142 cases (96%), the soft distal ICA could be initially isolated and controlled without dissection of the plaque-bearing bulb bifurcation area (group A), and in the remaining six cases, the carotid bifurcation had to be exposed and retracted to allow ICA clamping (group B). A shunt was needed in 15 cases (14 in group A, one in group B), which left 128 cases (86%) in which the procedure could be performed with the ICA clamped and the brain theoretically protected from particulate plaque embolism. There were no strokes or deaths, one patient had temporary vertebrobasilar ischemia, one patient had a myocardial infarct, one patient had a temporary accessory nerve palsy, one patient returned to the operating room for release of a cervical hematoma, and 94% spent one postoperative night in the hospital.\nEarly selective distal ICA control is highly achievable during CEA without apparently compromising clinical results. Its use is relevant when selective methods of shunting that do not need initial control of the common and external carotid arteries (eg, local cervical block anesthesia, electroencephalography/other monitoring) are used.

    "abstract": "For many years, thoracic sympathectomy via open surgery was not used to treat Raynaud's phenomenon because of the invasiveness of this procedure and the poor long-term outcomes associated with it. However, with the introduction of endoscopic surgery, thoracic sympathectomy (or sympathicotomy) has been performed by some surgeons as a less invasive surgical option for patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. The less invasive procedure has the possibility of emphasizing merits of sympathectomy. The purpose of this study was to reevaluate the efficacy of sympathicotomy for Raynaud's phenomenon with endoscopic technique and its range of applicability.\nBetween December 1992 and August 2001, endoscopic thoracic sympathicotomy (ETS) was performed in 28 patients with Raynaud's phenomenon (of a total of 502 patients with autonomic disorders who underwent ETS) at National Kanazawa Hospital. We considered indications for surgical treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon to include severe chronic symptoms or nonhealing digital ulceration refractory to intensive medical therapy. All patients were mailed a self-assessment questionnaire after surgery to determine the immediate and long-term results of the procedure. Data from both initial and long-term follow-up examinations were obtained.\nFifty-four ETS procedures were performed in 28 patients. No operative mortality was seen, and no occurrence of major complications necessitated open surgery. Initial resolution or improvement of symptoms was achieved in 26 of 28 patients (92.9%). However, later in the postoperative period, symptoms recurred in 23 of 28 patients (82.1%), although no recurrence of digital ulceration was seen throughout our observation. At the final follow-up examination (median follow-up period, 62.5 months), 25 patients (89.3%) reported overall improvement of the frequency and severity of their symptoms.\nDespite the high rate of recurrence, ETS clearly produced a high rate of initial relief. ETS did indeed promote healing of digital ulcers, and the procedure shows potential for reducing the severity of refractory symptoms. We consider ETS to be the method of choice for treatment of severe or refractory Raynaud's phenomenon, and especially for Raynaud's involving digital ulcer, because of its safety and efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Cervical and anomalous first ribs are rare conditions, occurring in less than 1% of the population. This manuscript reviews our management of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) associated with these congenital anomalies.\nDuring the past 26 years, 65 operations were performed for abnormal ribs that produced symptoms of TOS. Of these, 54 operations were for neurogenic TOS and are covered in this paper. Indications for surgery were disabling pain and paresthesia and failure to respond to conservative treatment. Surgical technique for neurogenic TOS was supraclavicular cervical rib resection and scalenectomy without first rib resection in 22 cases, supraclavicular cervical and first rib resection in 17 cases, supraclavicular excision of anomalous first ribs in five cases, and transaxillary anomalous first rib resections in two cases (total, 46 cases). Eight reoperations were performed for recurrent TOS in patients who previously had undergone cervical and first rib resections.\nNeck trauma was the cause of neurogenic symptoms in 80% of patients with cervical or anomalous first ribs. The surgical failure rate was 28% for 46 primary operations. A significant variable in results was the etiology of the symptoms. The failure rate for patients in whom symptoms developed after work-related injuries or repetitive stress at work was 42%, and the failure rates for patients whose symptoms followed an auto accident or developed spontaneously were 26% and 18%, respectively. The failure rate in each etiology group also was affected by the operation performed. The failure rate for cervical rib resection without first rib resection in the work-related group was 75% compared with a failure rate of 38% in the non-work-related group. In contrast, when both cervical and first ribs were resected, the failure rate in the work-related group fell to 25% and in the non-work-related group to 20%. These failure rates for the work-related and non-work-related groups are similar to our failure rates in patients without cervical ribs.\nSurgery for neurogenic TOS in patients with cervical ribs should include both cervical and first rib resection. The presence of cervical or anomalous first ribs in patients with neurogenic TOS does not improve the success rate from surgery compared with patients without abnormal ribs. Neck trauma is the most common cause for neurogenic TOS in patients with abnormal ribs. Cervical and anomalous first ribs are the predisposing factors rather than the cause.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage is a commonly used adjunct to thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair that improves perioperative spinal cord perfusion and thereby decreases the incidence of paraplegia. To date, little data exist on possible complications, such as subdural hematoma caused by stretching and tearing of dural veins, should CSF drainage be excessive. We reviewed our experience with patients in whom postoperative subdural hematomas were detected.\nThe records of 230 patients who underwent TAAA repair at the Johns Hopkins Hospital between January 1992 and February 2001 were reviewed.\nEight patients had subdural hematomas (3.5%). The four men and four women had a mean age of 60.6 years; two of these patients had a connective tissue disorder. All patients had lumbar drains placed before surgery, including one patient who underwent an emergency operation for rupture. Drains were set to allow drainage for CSF pressure greater than 5 cm H(2)O in all but one patient set for 10 cm H(2)O; spinal cooling was not performed in any patient. All drains were removed on the third postoperative day. In patients in whom subdural hematomas developed, the mean amount of CSF removed after surgery was 690 +/- 79 mL, which was significantly greater than the amount drained from patients in whom subdural hematomas did not develop (359 +/- 24 mL; P =.0013, Mann-Whitney U test). Six patients had postoperative subdural hematomas detected during hospitalization (mean postoperative day, 9.3; range, 2 to 16), and two patients were seen in delayed fashion after discharge from the hospital at 1.5 and 5 months. Four patients died of the subdural hematoma (50%); only one of these patients had neurosurgical intervention. All four survivors responded to neurosurgical intervention and are neurologically healthy. Two patients, both of whom were seen in delayed fashion, needed a lumbar blood patch. Multivariate logistic regression identified the volume of CSF drained as the only variable predictive of occurrence of subdural hematoma (P =.01).\nSubdural hematoma is an unusual and potentially catastrophic complication after TAAA repair. Prompt recognition and neurosurgical intervention is necessary for survival and recovery after acute presentation. Epidural placement of a blood patch is recommended if a chronic subdural hematoma is detected. Care should be taken to ensure that excessive CSF is not drained perioperatively, and higher (10 cm H(2)O) lumbar drain popoff pressures may be necessary together with meticulous monitoring of patient position and neurologic status.",

    "results": "Eight patients had subdural hematomas (3.5%). The four men and four women had a mean age of 60.6 years; two of these patients had a connective tissue disorder. All patients had lumbar drains placed before surgery, including one patient who underwent an emergency operation for rupture. Drains were set to allow drainage for CSF pressure greater than 5 cm H(2)O in all but one patient set for 10 cm H(2)O; spinal cooling was not performed in any patient. All drains were removed on the third postoperative day. In patients in whom subdural hematomas developed, the mean amount of CSF removed after surgery was 690 +/- 79 mL, which was significantly greater than the amount drained from patients in whom subdural hematomas did not develop (359 +/- 24 mL; P =.0013, Mann-Whitney U test). Six patients had postoperative subdural hematomas detected during hospitalization (mean postoperative day, 9.3; range, 2 to 16), and two patients were seen in delayed fashion after discharge from the hospital at 1.5 and 5 months. Four patients died of the subdural hematoma (50%); only one of these patients had neurosurgical intervention. All four survivors responded to neurosurgical intervention and are neurologically healthy. Two patients, both of whom were seen in delayed fashion, needed a lumbar blood patch. Multivariate logistic regression identified the volume of CSF drained as the only variable predictive of occurrence of subdural hematoma (P =.01).",

    "abstract": "An accepted fact is that abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) larger than 5.5 cm should undergo elective repair. However, subsets of these patients have serious comorbid conditions, which greatly increase operative risk. This study evaluated the outcomes of periods of protracted nonoperative observational management with selective delayed surgery in patients at high risk with large infrarenal and pararenal AAAs.\nAmong 226 patients with AAAs more than 5.5 cm, we selected 72 with AAAs from 5.6 to 12.0 cm (mean, 7.0 cm) for periods of nonoperative management because of their prohibitive surgical risks. Comorbid factors included a low ejection fraction of 15% to 34% (mean, 22%) in 18 patients, 1 second forced expiratory volume less than 50% (mean, 38%) in 25, prior laparotomy in 10, and morbid obesity in 22. Follow-up examination was complete in the 72 patients for the 6 to 76 months (mean, 23 months) that they underwent nonoperative treatment. Fifty-three patients ultimately underwent operation because of AAA enlargement or onset of symptoms after 6 to 72 months (mean, 19 months) of nonoperative treatment.\nOf the 72 selected patients, 54 (75%) are living and 18 (25%) are dead. Seven patients who underwent only nonoperative treatment presently survive after 28 to 76 months (mean, 48 months). Of the 18 deaths, AAA rupture occurred in only three patients (4%) who were observed for 12, 31, and 72 months before rupture. Nine other deaths (13%) occurred after 6 to 72 months from comorbidities unrelated to the AAA. Six of the 53 patients who underwent delayed operation died within 30 days of operation (11% mortality rate). The mortality rate for the 154 good-risk patients with an AAA who underwent prompt open or endovascular repair was 2.2%.\nThese data indicate that some patients with large AAAs and serious comorbidities are acceptably managed for long periods (6 to 76 months) with nonoperative means. Substantial delays of 12 to 76 months resulted in an AAA rupture rate of only 4%, and 13% of these patients (nine of 72) died of comorbidities unrelated to AAA rupture or surgery. Mortality rate in this group of patients, when operated, was 11% (six of 53). These findings support the selective use of nonoperative management in some patients with large AAAs and serious comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "The risk factors of aortic aneurysm (AA) are comparable with those described for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This study was performed to determine whether patients with AA have a higher than average prevalence of obstructive airway disease.\nWe performed pulmonary function tests in 240 consecutive patients (182 men and 58 women; age, 70 +/- 10 years) with thoracic or abdominal AA. The results were compared with those in individuals without obvious cardiovascular disease (control) and in patients with coronary artery disease who were matched for age, gender, smoking status, and other atherosclerotic risk factors.\nPatients in the AA group had a lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (%) and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (%/predicted value) than did the control group (P <.01). The proportion of patients with airway obstruction, defined as forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity of 70% or less, was higher in the AA group (100/240; 42%) than in the control (51/223; 23%) and coronary artery disease (43/238; 18%) groups.

One hundred and ten consecutive patients underwent infrarenal aortic surgery with a combination of acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) and intraoperative cell salvage (ICS). All patients underwent hemodilution to a target hemoglobin concentration of 11 g/dL and underwent ICS with a centrifugal device.\nMedian blood loss was 1140 mL (interquartile range [IQR], 683 to 1609 mL) in 78 aneurysm repairs and 775 mL (IQR, 400 to 1225 mL) in 32 aortobifemoral bypasses for occlusive disease (P =.02), resulting in a median salvaged red cell volume of 403 mL (IQR, 256 to 563 mL) for aneurysm repairs and 250 mL (IQR, 200 to 290 mL) in bypass surgery (P =.001). Thirty-six patients (33%) needed transfusion of stored blood, for a total of 115 units, with just four patients needing more than five units. The mortality rate was 8% (9/110). With multivariate analysis, low hemoglobin level (P =.006) and low platelet count (P =.023) were associated with stored blood transfusion.\nBlood loss is too small to justify ICS in surgery for occlusive disease; ANH alone may be a suitable strategy.

    "abstract": "The inability to tolerate feedings after aortic surgery prolongs hospitalization. The aim of this study was to define jejunal manometric and small bowel transit characteristics associated with the ileus that follows transperitoneal aortic surgery.\nFive male patients who underwent transperitoneal infrarenal aortobifemoral bypass had intraoperative placement of a jejunal multilumen catheter. The open abdomen allowed precise placement of pressure recording ports at 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 38 cm past the ligament of Treitz. Three-hour manometric studies were done after surgery and for 3 postoperative days. The migrating motor complex was identified visually on the manometric tracings, and pressure waves were identified with computer and a motility index calculated. Motility data were compared with healthy control data previously reported in the literature. Small bowel transit was determined with barium and serial abdominal radiographs.\nAll patients had ileus develop with return of bowel sounds at 2 to 7 days (median, 6 days) and flatus at 3 to 9 days (median, 7 days) after surgery. Jejunal motor activity was present within 6 hours of surgery, but the motility index was less in patients then in control subjects. The postoperative migrating motor complexes differed from control subjects in having more phase I, less phase II, and more frequent phase IIIs. Phase III retrograde migration was common in the patients but not in the control subjects. Small bowel transit was 2 days or greater in all patients.\nMotor activity is present in the jejunum shortly after aortic surgery. However, the activity is decreased in intensity and the fasting cycle differs from control subjects. Retrograde migration of phase III is the most likely abnormality, resulting in delayed small bowel transit. The data would predict a high rate of enteral feeding intolerance early after surgery. Future studies should focus on pharmacologic manipulation to rapidly return small bowel motility to a more normal state after aortic surgery.",

    "abstract": "Aortic clamping proximal to the renal arteries is sometimes necessitated during infrarenal and juxtarenal aortic surgery and may be associated with an increased risk of renal ischemia and its consequences. The aim of the study was to estimate this risk and possibly identify a \"safe\" duration of renal ischemia.\nMedical records were retrospectively reviewed for 60 consecutive patients (from 1987 to 1994) with abdominal aortic aneurysm (n = 43) and occlusive disease (n = 17) confined to the infrarenal or juxtarenal aorta who underwent infrarenal aortic reconstruction with temporary suprarenal clamping. The data obtained included risk factors, preoperative and postoperative serum creatinine level, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) value, proteinuria before surgery, and suprarenal clamping times.\nThe mean age of the patients was 64.4 years (+/- 11.4 years), and 74% were men. Concomitant cardiac disease was present in 41% of the patients, and 9% had diabetes. The preoperative creatinine level was 1.21 mg/dL (+/- 0.54 mg/dL), and the BUN value was 16.6 mg/dL (+/- 7.8 mg/dL). During surgery, blood flow to the renal arteries was interrupted for 32.0 minutes (+/- 17 minutes). None of the surviving patients needed dialysis or had signs of acute renal failure after the operations, but transient azotemia (rise in creatinine level) occurred in 23% of the patients. Risk factors for this condition were high preoperative creatinine values and hypotension during surgery, but the main determinant was total renal ischemia time. Odds ratios for such transient renal dysfunction showed as much as a 10-fold risk when suprarenal aortic clamping was greater than 50 minutes as compared with 30 minutes or less.\nPostoperative renal function impairment is rare in this group of patients. If suprarenal clamp duration (renal ischemia time) is brief, patients with normal preoperative creatinine levels exhibit no increase or a marginal increase in BUN or creatinine levels after surgery. Accordingly, suprarenal aortic clamping less than 50 minutes in this patient group appears safe and well tolerated.",

    "abstract": "The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate compliance, side effects, and safety associated with prolonged administration of doxycycline in patients with small asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). A secondary goal was to determine how treatment with doxycycline influences circulating levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in this patient population.\nThirty-six patients with AAAs (30 men and 6 women; mean age, 69 +/- 1 years) were enrolled into a 6-month phase II study to evaluate treatment with doxycycline (100 mg orally twice a day). Aneurysm size was measured before and after treatment, and compliance and side effects were monitored. Plasma levels of doxycycline were measured midway through the study, and plasma MMP-9 concentrations were measured at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.\nThirty-three of the 36 patients (92%) completed 6 months of doxycycline treatment. Significant treatment-related side effects occurred in five patients (13.9%), including three with cutaneous photosensitivity reactions (8.3%), one with tooth discoloration (2.8%), and one with yeast infection (2.8%). A high rate of compliance with treatment was seen, despite minor but frequent side effects, including nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms (25%), easily managed episodes of photosensitivity (22.2%), and reversible tooth discoloration (5.5%). The mean plasma doxycycline level after 3 months was 4.62 +/- 0.68 ug/mL (median, 3.64 microg/mL; range, 1.31 to 14.39 microg/mL; n = 23 patients). No significant change was seen in AAA diameter (42.7 +/- 1.3 mm at 6 months versus 41.0 +/- 0.9 mm at baseline), and the overall rate of AAA expansion was 0.63% +/- 0.25% per month. The mean plasma MMP-9 level (n = 19 patients) was elevated at baseline (118.9 +/- 37.9 ng/mL; upper limit of normal, 85 ng/mL) but subsequently decreased to 83.8 +/- 32.9 ng/mL at 3 months (not significant versus baseline) and to 66.4 +/- 24.2 ng/mL at 6 months (P =.022 versus baseline). Only 21% of patients had an elevated level of plasma MMP-9 after 6 months of treatment compared with 47% at baseline (P <.05).\nProlonged administration of doxycycline is safe and well tolerated by patients with small asymptomatic AAAs and is associated with a gradual reduction in plasma MMP-9 levels. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of doxycycline on the rate and extent of aneurysm growth and the potential use of plasma MMP-9 levels as a biomarker of aneurysm disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Aortobifemoral bypass remains the standard therapy for aortoiliac occlusive disease. Extraanatomic revascularization has been considered as an acceptable alternative and provides reasonable long-term results. Because some of the causes for its failure are related to the prosthetic material used, a technique that uses autologous material and is applicable in patients with unilateral common iliac lesions was developed. Iliofemoral crossover transposition is a femorofemoral bypass procedure in which the external iliac artery is used as a graft. The procedure is easily performed and avoids the use of prosthetic materials, minimizing the risks of their related complications. Because its biologic behavior, including hemodynamic performance, has proven to be excellent, satisfactory long-term results can be anticipated.",

    "abstract": "The role of oxidative stress in the formation of aneurysms is not fully understood. We used the complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray technique to determine the transcription profile in the development of elastase-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm in rat models, with an emphasis on the oxidative stress-related genes.\nIn the experimental group, rat abdominal aortas were perfused with elastase to induce AAA. In the control group, a sham operation was performed with perfusion of the aortas with saline solution. Four or five animals were used for each time point for each of the elastase-treated or saline-treated groups. At day 2, day 7, and day 10 after surgery, the external aortic diameter was measured and AAA formation was estimated. Total RNA was isolated from aortas and subjected to cDNA microarray analysis with the use of the rat genome U34A high-density oligonucleotide DNA chip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif), which contains a total number of 8799 genes of which 2017 are expressed sequence tag (EST) genes. The data were analyzed with the GENECHIP Data Mining Tool software (Affymetrix). For genes of interest, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to confirm their expression level.\nComparison ranking analysis revealed that during AAA development, the expression of 212 genes, including 46 of EST genes, increased by more than two-fold and 229 genes, including 95 of EST genes, decreased by more than two-fold in at least one of the three time points. The regulated genes included those encoding heme oxygenase, inducible nitric oxide synthase, some extracellular matrix proteins, members of the matrix metalloproteinase family, and those associated with prooxidant/antioxidant and inflammatory responses. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress, such as heme oxygenase, inducible nitric oxide synthase, 12-lipoxygenase, and heart cytochrome c oxydase subunit VIa, and the downregulation of antioxidant genes, such as superoxide dismutase, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-cytochrome b-5 reductase, and glutathion S-transferase.\nThe cDNA microarray technique was useful for investigation of the transcription profiles during the development of AAA. Our results indicate that oxidative stress may play a pivotal role in the pathologic progression of AAA.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms of neointima formation after synthetic vascular grafting are not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the intima and perigraft adventitia remodeling process in terms of cell apoptosis versus proliferation after synthetic patch implantation.\nFemale Merino sheep were randomized equally into two groups and underwent implantion with a patch of gelatin sealed Dacron graft into the left common carotid artery. At 1 and 6 months, grafted vessels were harvested, processed, and assessed. Intimal area and lumen sizes were measured with histologic assessment of eight segments from each animal assisted with image analysis. Immunohistochemical labeling of alpha-actin and D33 desmin was performed on tissue sections of perigraft adventitia, graft matrix, and intima. Cell proliferation and cell phenotype were determined with double immunohistochemical staining with anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen and anti-alpha-actin or antimacrophage antibodies (HAM 56) in perigraft adventitia, graft matrix, and intima. Apoptosis was detected with in situ terminal deoxynucleiotidyl transferase-mediated 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate-fluorescence nick end labeling (TUNEL) in perigraft adventitia, graft matrix, and intima.\nThe carotid artery lumen size at 6 months was significantly larger than at 1 month (P <or=.05). The intimal area was significantly reduced at 6 months compared with 1 month (P <.05). At 1 month and 6 months, perigraft adventitia, graft matrix, and intima showed positive alpha-actin expression but negative desmin staining. In the anastomotic area, a small number of intimal cells suggested their muscle origin (expression alpha-actin and desmin). The number of proliferating cells in the intima was significantly greater at 1 month than at 6 months (P =.01). TUNEL-positive cells were significantly greater in the intima at 1 month than at 6 months (P <.05), whereas TUNEL-positive cells were significantly greater at 6 months in the perigraft adventitia (P <.05). HAM 56-positive cells in the intima at 1 month were significantly greater compared with 6 months (P <.05), whereas in graft and perigraft regions, no significant difference was seen between 1 month and 6 months.\nThe cell proliferation and cell phenotype change in intima and perigraft adventitia are associated with thickening of perigraft adventitia and intima at 1 month. The balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis could account in part for the reduction in intima area and perigraft adventitial cellularity at 6 months.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this retrospective study was to document the extent of thrombus in patients with recurrent and first deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\nA total of 864 patients with DVT of the leg were enrolled in the study. They were divided into two groups: patients with recurrent DVT (n = 233) of the leg, and patients with first DVT of the leg (n = 631). In both groups the extent of the thrombus was evaluated by duplex scanning, contrast venography, or magnetic resonance imaging. Thrombus involving veins distal to the popliteal vein was classified as distal DVT, whereas involvement of the popliteal vein and proximal was classified as proximal DVT.\nWe could demonstrate that involvement of proximal segments (CEAP anatomic classification 1-9) occurred significantly more often in patients with recurrent DVT than in patients with the first DVT (P <.001). The incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) and the clinical symptoms of PE were equally distributed between patients with recurrent DVT and those with first DVT (P >.05). Only one patient died as a consequence of PE in our patient sample.\nIn our experience, patients with recurrent DVT have a higher frequency of proximal DVT. Nevertheless, the incidence of PE is similar in patients with recurrent and those with first DVT.",

    "abstract": "Hand ischemia resulting from arterial steal is a serious complication in patients undergoing hemodialysis access, but specific risk factors for steal remain in dispute. The purpose of this study was to determine whether plethysmographically derived finger pressures (FPs) or digital-brachial indices (DBIs) are predictive of symptomatic arterial steal.\nWe prospectively studied 72 patients (37 men, 35 women; mean age, 57 +/- 10 years) who were undergoing brachial artery-based hemodialysis access. All patients had complete pre- and postoperative hand examinations and FP determinations. Surgeons were blinded to preoperative FP results.\nProsthetic graft was used in 60 patients (6-mm polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] in 50, tapered PTFE in 10), and brachial-based arteriovenous fistulas were created in 12. Fourteen (19%) patients developed arterial steal symptoms. The mean preoperative FP was significantly lower in steal patients than in those without steal (131 +/- 27 vs 151 +/- 31 mm Hg, P <.03). Nine (64%) of the patients with steal had DBIs <1.0, compared to 18 (31%) of the patients without steal (P =.02). However, there was no absolute FP or DBI threshold below which steal was inevitable. The occurrence of steal was attributed to proximal arterial stenoses in seven, to distal arterial disease in five, and was unknown in two. When comparing the 14 patients who developed steal to the 58 who did not, we noted that a higher proportion of steal patients had coronary artery disease (57% vs 17%, P =.005). Steal was more likely to develop in patients with arteriovenous fistulas than in patients with prosthetic grafts (43% vs 14%, P =.009). There were no significant differences in demographic factors, atherosclerotic risks (diabetes, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia), prevalence of peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, shunt location, tapered vs straight graft, or number of prior grafts placed.\nThese data indicate that preoperative FPs are lower in patients who develop steal syndrome after hemodialysis access. Patients with preoperative DBIs <1.0 are more likely to develop steal, but there is no DBI threshold below which steal is inevitable. Steal is more likely in patients undergoing brachial-based arteriovenous fistulas than in those receiving prosthetic grafts.",

    "abstract": "The use of postoperative anticoagulation is not uncommon for patients undergoing vascular procedures, whether for adjunctive therapy to the surgical procedure or for resumption of preoperative anticoagulation. We investigated whether low-molecular-weight heparin, specifically enoxaparin, was an effective replacement for intravenous heparin during the postoperative period until achievement of a therapeutic international normalized ratio, together with the impact on postoperative length of stay.\nWe retrospectively examined 330 patients who received either traditional intravenous unfractionated heparin with adjusted-dose warfarin daily (n = 169) or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin, specifically enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, with adjusted-dose warfarin daily (n = 161). Safety was defined as incidence of bleeding, hematoma, stroke, expiration, thrombocytopenia, return to surgery for graft thrombosis or hematoma, and readmission within 30 days for hematoma or thrombosis.\nFor all procedures, regardless of type of anticoagulation treatment, there was no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications, except for the increased incidence of return to surgery for graft thrombosis (P =.02), failing graft (P =.0004), and debridement (P =.01) in patients who received unfractionated heparin. For all procedures combined, the average postoperative length of stay was shortened by 2 days with use of low-molecular-weight heparin (P =.0001).\nIn this series, use of enoxaparin appears to be safe and effective for vascular postoperative anticoagulation. At the same time, its use can significantly reduce the average postoperative length of stay for patients undergoing vascular procedures. Further prospective data are needed before this protocol can be accepted as an alternative for postoperative anticoagulation in this set of patients.",

    "abstract": "Autogenous vein is the conduit of choice in patients presenting for infrainguinal arterial reconstruction. Venous conduit may be limited because of inadequacy or prior utilization. Our group and others use prosthetics to maximize limb salvage with moderate results. However, in cases where patients present with an isolated popliteal segment that may extend below the knee, we have performed prosthetic bypasses to this above-knee segment and then used a venous reconstruction from the native arterial circulation to a more distal outflow tract. In this report, we will analyze our results using this type of reconstruction in patients who present for limb salvage with no all-autogenous option.\nFrom 1992 to 2000, 27 patients presented for limb salvage with an isolated popliteal artery and inadequate vein for continuous bypass. There were 106 patients in this period without an isolated popliteal segment or adequate vein who underwent prosthetic bypass with distal vein cuff or arteriovenous fistula. The vascular registry and patient charts were reviewed for indication, demographics, and type of composite reconstruction. Outcomes were calculated with use of life table methods and compared by log rank analysis.\nDemographics revealed 16 (59%) men, 16 (59%) patients with diabetes, and 4 (15%) smokers with a mean age of 71 years (range, 51-87 years). The venous reconstructions had the inflow taken from the distal native popliteal artery in 26 (above knee in 8 and below knee in 18) and the peroneal artery in one. The outflow involved the below-knee popliteal in one (4%), a tibial in 23 (85%), and the dorsalis pedis artery in 3 (11%). Morbidity included bleeding (4%), wound infection (4%), and limb loss (4%). Mortality occurred in one patient (4%), and no revisions were required in follow-up. Six late failures were identified, one of which resulted in amputation. Primary patency and limb salvage were 80% and 88% at 1 year, respectively. For comparison, our results using prosthetic with vein cuff had a 1-year primary patency of 52% and limb salvage of 92% (P = NS), whereas prosthetic with an arteriovenous fistula was 73% and 84%, respectively (P = NS).\nComposite sequential reconstruction using an isolated popliteal segment as inflow for the distal reconstruction is an acceptable option in patients presenting for limb salvage reconstruction with limited venous conduit. This type of reconstruction, when available, may be a better option than pure prosthetic with or without a vein cuff or arteriovenous fistula.",

PATIENTS AD METHODS: Eighty patients, 40 with claudication and 40 with critical ischemia, were assessed before and one month after revascularization by using comparable domains of the NHP and the SF-36 questionnaires.\nThe SF-36 scores were less skewed and were distributed more homogeneously than the NHP scores. Discriminate validity results showed that NHP was better than SF-36 in discriminating among levels of ischemia with respect to pain and physical mobility. For both questionnaires, the reliability standards were satisfactory in most respects. The NHP was more responsive than the SF-36 in detecting within-patient changes. All of the NHP domains not zero at baseline were improved significantly one month after hemodynamically successful revascularization for patients with claudication, whereas patients with critical ischemia showed significant abatement of pain and improvements in physical mobility and social isolation. The SF-36 scores indicated a significant decrease in bodily pain and improvements in physical functioning and vitality for patients with claudication, and decrease in bodily pain and improvement in physical functioning for patients with critical ischemia.\nThe findings indicated that both NHP and SF-36 were reliable. The SF-36 scores were less skewed than the NHP scores, whereas NHP discriminated better among levels of ischemia and was more responsive in detecting quality-of-life changes over time than SF-36 in these particular patients.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to define changes in aneurysm volume after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nA total of 154 consecutive patients who underwent endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm with the Medtronic AneuRx stent graft at Stanford University Hospital were evaluated. During a mean follow-up period of 15.8 +/- 11.3 months, serial computerized measurements of aneurysm volume and orthogonal maximal diameter were performed on helical computed tomographic scan data sets and maximal transverse diameter was measured manually from transverse computed tomographic images. Aortoiliac length (renal to hypogastric artery origin) was measured along the median luminal centerline and along the straight line.\nAneurysm volume increased immediately after endovascular repair (from 180.2 +/- 69.9 mL to 187.9 +/- 71.6 mL; P <.001), but orthogonal and transverse diameter and aortoiliac length did not change significantly. During the follow-up period, mean volume decreased to 171.9 +/- 70.2 mL (P <.05) and straight-line and centerline aortoiliac length remained unchanged from preoperative values. Overall, volume decreased at a rate of 1.7 +/- 5.9 mL/mo (P <.001). During periods without endoleak, the rate of decrease was 3.2 +/- 5.5 mL/mo (P <.001), and during periods with endoleak, aneurysm volume increased at a rate of 2.0 +/- 5.3 mL/mo (P <.005), without a difference between types of endoleak. Predictive values for the presence of endoleak were similar for transverse and orthogonal diameter and volume. Logistic regression analysis showed volume to be most closely associated with the presence of endoleak.\nAneurysm volume increases immediately after endovascular repair. After repair, aneurysm volume gradually decreases and aortoiliac length remains unchanged. Changes in volume parallel changes in maximal aneurysm diameter, and their association with the presence of an endoleak does not appear to be appreciably stronger.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to utilize an objective endpoint analysis of aneurysm treatment, which is based on the primary objective of aneurysm repair, and to apply it to a consecutive series of patients undergoing open and endovascular repair.\nAneurysm-related death was defined as any death that occurred within 30 days of primary aneurysm treatment (open or endovascular), within 30 days of a secondary aneurysm or graft-related treatment, or any death related to the aneurysm or graft at any time following treatment. We reviewed 417 consecutive patients undergoing elective infrarenal aortic aneurysm repair: 243 patients with open repair and 174 patients with endovascular repair.\nThere was no difference between the groups (open vs endovascular) with regard to mean age +/- standard deviation (73 +/- 8 years vs 74 +/- 8 years) or aneurysm size (64 +/- 2 mm vs 58 +/- 10 mm) (P = not significant [NS]). The 30-day mortality for the primary procedure after open repair was 3.7% (9/243) and after endovascular repair was 0.6% (1/174, P <.05). The 30-day mortality for secondary procedures after open repair was 14% (6/41) compared to 0% after endovascular repair (P <.05). The aneurysm-related death rate was 4.1% (10/243) after open surgery and 0.6% (1/174) after endovascular repair (P <.05). Mean follow-up was 5 months longer following open repair (P <.05). Secondary procedures were performed in 41 patients following open surgery and 27 patients following endovascular repair (P = NS). Secondary procedures following open repair were performed for anastomotic aneurysms (n = 18), graft infection (n = 6), aortoenteric fistula (n = 5), anastomotic hemorrhage (n = 4), lower extremity amputation (n = 4), graft thrombosis (n = 3), and distal revascularization (n = 1). Secondary procedures following endovascular repair consisted of proximal extender cuffs (n = 11), distal extender cuffs (n = 11), limb thrombosis (n = 3), and surgical conversion (n = 2). The magnitude of secondary procedures following open repair was greater with longer operative time 292 +/- 89 minutes vs 129 +/- 33 minutes (P <.0001), longer length of stay 13 +/- 10 days vs 2 +/- 2 days (P <.0001) and greater blood loss 3382 +/- 4278 mL vs 851 +/- 114 mL (P <.0001).\nThe aneurysm-related death rate combines early and late deaths and should be used as the primary outcome measure to objectively compare the results of open and endovascular repair in the treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms. In our experience, endovascular aneurysm repair reduced the overall aneurysm-related death rate when compared to open repair. Secondary procedures are required after both open and endovascular repair. However, the magnitude, morbidity, and mortality of secondary procedures are reduced significantly with endovascular repair.",

    "abstract": "Despite an increasing number of elective operations on abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), the age- and sex-standardized mortality rate of ruptured AAA (RAAA) continues to increase. In the Pirkanmaa region, population 440,000, all aortic surgery is performed at Tampere University Hospital (TAUH). Procedures have been collected into the vascular registry. The purpose of this study was (1) to establish the incidence, modes of treatment, and mortality of RAAA in a defined geographic area; (2) to evaluate the prerupture history to determine if there are any ways to prevent rupture; and to make a forecast about the increase of RAAAs in the next decades.\nPopulation and outcome data in the Pirkanmaa region and information on all patients who died of RAAA during 1990-1997 were provided by Statistics Finland. All operated RAAAs that underwent procedures during 1990 to 1999 were identified from the local vascular registry. To make a forecast for the next decades, an incidence of RAAA was calculated separately for each age group in 5-year intervals.\nFrom 1990 to 1997, 221 patients presented with RAAA. The mean incidence was 6.3/100,000 inhabitants. The incidence in the population over 65 years was 35.5/100,000. The total RAAA mortality was 76.9%. A total of 139 patients reached TAUH and 111 underwent emergency surgery. The overall hospital mortality in TAUH was 63.3%. The calculated annual number of RAAA will increase 49.6% in the next 2 decades, and the overall incidence will increase from 6.3 to 8.9/100,000 inhabitants. According to the vascular registry, 166 patients were operated on for RAAA during 1990 to 1999 in TAUH. The 30-day mortality was 50.6%. A minority of the patients (n = 18, 10.8%) had a previously documented AAA. The median diameter at the time of rupture was 7 cm. Seven (5.0%) men and six (24.0%) women had a diameter of less than 5.5 cm.\nThe incidence of RAAA in the Pirkanmaa region in 1990s was the Finnish average. In the next two decades, the number of individuals with RAAA will increase significantly. One quarter of women had a diameter of AAA at the time of rupture that was under the current threshold indicator for elective operation.",

All 45 patients were investigated by using TCD: first preoperatively, then during the first few days after CEA before discharge from the hospital, and finally 3 to 12 months later. In addition, all patients underwent duplex investigation of the internal carotid artery the day before surgery and 3 months postoperatively. For the analysis, the patients were divided into two groups, one with (S-group), suspected postoperative neurologic complications/symptoms and another one without (C-group). Six patients were assigned to the S-group and 37 to the C-group, the latter including two patients who underwent bilateral CEAs.\nIn the whole study group,a significant postoperative increase in systolic flow velocity was recorded bilaterally in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) as measured some days after surgery. The patients in the S-group showed high blood flow velocities mainly in the MCA on the ipsilateral side. A contralateral flow velocity increase did not occur in patients with very severe contralateral stenosis or occlusion (n = 9) if the late follow-up investigation was chosen as a reference value. Twenty patients in the C-group formed a subgroup with high blood pressure and/or headache postoperatively (CB-group) The other 19 patients were referred to as the CA-group. The CB- and S-groups showed more pronounced vessel disease in internal carotid artery on the contralateral side combined with lower collateral capacity in the circle of Willis compared to the CA-group. In the S-group the mean +/- standard deviation peak systolic velocity in ipsilateral MCA increased from a preoperative value of 0.71 +/- 0.22 m/sec to 2.23 +/- 0.72 m/sec (P <.005). In the CB-group, we observed a bilateral MCA blood flow velocity increase from 0.72 +/- 0.18 to 1.35 +/- 0.56 m/sec (P <.0001) on the ipsilateral side and from 0.82 +/- 0.37 to 1.28 +/- 0.66 m/sec (P < 0.001) on the contralateral side. In the CA-group, we observed minor bilateral blood flow velocity increases in the MCA, from 0.79 +/- 0.25 m/sec to 1.03 +/- 0.33 m/sec on the ipsilateral (P <.001) and from 0.70 +/- 0.17 m/sec to 0.93 +/- 0.26 m/sec on the contralateral side (P <.005). At the follow-up 3 to 12 months after surgery, the MCA flow velocities had returned to normal.\nSoon after surgery, blood flow velocity increases often bilaterally in the MCA. However a contralateral flow velocity increase did not occur in patients with very severe contralateral stenosis or occlusion if the late follow-up investigation was chosen as a reference value. The clinical significance of bilateral flow velocity increases is uncertain, but very high blood flow velocities might be a signal for cerebrovascular hyperperfusion. In those patients, increased postoperative surveillance is recommended.",

All patients were entered in a follow-up program that ranged from 1 to 108 months (mean, 56.4 months) and included color duplex scan examinations at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery and every year thereafter.\nThe number of major (stroke and death) perioperative cerebrovascular accidents was eight (4.1%) in the DS Group and five (1.5%) in the BPPA group (P =.066). One death occurred in the DS group, and three occurred in the BPPA Group (P =.517). The four deaths in both groups were the result of strokes. No statistically significant difference was found in terms of early neurologic complications between the two groups. During the first year of follow-up study, the rate of restenosis >60% and occlusion was significantly lower in the BPPA group. Thereafter, the difference was not significant.\nIn our experience, the use of BPPA or DS during carotid endarterectomy procedure does not cause a significantly different rate of perioperative major events (stroke or death) in the two groups. The incidence rate of restenosis is lower in the first year after surgery with BPPA, but in subsequent years, no significant difference in restenosis is seen. The early and late postoperative results with BPPA compare favorably with the reported data from literature with the use of other patch materials.",

Despite promising early results with the distal revascularization-interval ligation (DRIL) procedure, the operation has not been widely adopted because of concerns about its complexity and long-term efficacy. The purpose of this report was to determine the efficacy and durability of the DRIL procedure in relieving hand ischemia and in maintaining access patency in the setting of hemodialysis access-induced ischemia.\nA retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent the DRIL procedure for access-induced ischemia. Demographic information was compiled, as were data regarding access and bypass patency, limb salvage, and patient survival. Arteriovenous access and brachial artery bypass patency rates were determined with life-table methods.\nBetween 1995 and 2001, we performed 55 DRIL procedures in 52 patients (35 women and 17 men; mean age, 60.8 years; range, 30 to 86 years). The indications for surgery were ischemic pain in 27 patients, tissue loss in 20 patients, loss of neurologic function in four patients, and pain on hemodialysis in one patient. Most patients (92%) had diabetes. The mean interval from access placement to DRIL was 7.4 months (range, 1 to 84 months). The mean follow-up interval was 16 months (range, 1 to 67 months). The brachial artery bypass primary patency rate was 80% at 4 years, and the arteriovenous access primary patency rate was 83% at 1 year. Forty-seven of 52 patients (90%) had substantial or complete relief of ischemic hand symptoms, and 15 of 20 patients with digital ischemic lesions have healed completely.\nDRIL is a durable and effective procedure that reliably accomplishes the twin goals in the treatment of angioaccess-induced ischemia: persistent relief of hand ischemia and continued access patency.",

    "abstract": "Surgical revision to repair stenosis is necessary in about 20% of lower extremity vein grafts (LEVGs). Alternate conduit, especially arm vein, is often necessary to achieve a policy of all-autogenous revisions. Although basilic vein harvest necessitates deep exposure in proximity to major nerves, it typically uses a large vein unaffected by prior intravenous lines and as such appears ideally suited for revisions in which a segmental interposition conduit is needed for revision within the graft or for extension to a more proximal inflow or distal outflow site. In this report, we describe our experience with the use of the basilic vein for LEVG revisions compared with other sources of autogenous conduit.\nAll patients who underwent LEVG were placed in a duplex scan surveillance program. LEVGs that developed a focal area of increased velocity or uniformly low velocities throughout the graft with appropriate lesions confirmed with angiography were candidates for revision. All patients who underwent graft revision with basilic vein segments from January 1, 1990, to September 1, 2001, were identified, and their courses were reviewed for subsequent adverse events (further revision or occlusion) and complications of harvest. These revisions were compared with revisions in which cephalic and saphenous vein were used.\nOne hundred thirty basilic veins were used to revise 122 LEVGs. The mean follow-up period after revision was 28 +/- 27 months. Ninety-three grafts (71%) remained patent with no further revision, and 37 grafts (29%) either needed additional revisions (22 grafts) or were occluded (15 grafts). Only four of these adverse events (11%) were directly attributed to the basilic vein segment. Ten of 43 grafts revised with cephalic vein (23%) were either revised or occluded, of which three were related to the cephalic vein segment (P = not significant, compared with basilic vein). Twenty-four of 81 grafts revised with saphenous vein (30%) were either revised or occluded, of which 11 were attributed to the saphenous vein segment (P <.01, compared with basilic vein). Two patients (1.5%) had complications from basilic vein harvest (one hematoma, one arterial injury). No neurologic injuries resulted from basilic vein harvest.\nThe basilic vein is a reliable and durable conduit when used to segmentally revise LEVGs. Stenoses rarely occur within interposed basilic vein segments, and excellent freedom from subsequent revision or occlusion is possible. We conclude the basilic vein can be safely harvested with minimal complications and is ideally suited for use as a short segment interposition graft for LEVG revision.",

    "abstract": "Although rare, superior mesenteric artery (SMA) aneurysms have a definite rupture risk. Past reports have suggested that this risk is low, yet most investigators recommend repair in selected patients. We reviewed our experience with 21 patients to try to determine when intervention was indicated.\nA retrospective review of the medical records of all patients with SMA aneurysms at our institutions from January 1980 through December 1998 was undertaken. Only patients with true aneurysms of the SMA were included.\nTwenty-one patients with true SMA aneurysms were identified and included 14 males (67%) and seven females (33%). This represents a 6.9% incidence rate of all visceral aneurysms seen at our institutions. Eight patients (38%) had rupture at presentation, including seven of the 14 males (50%). In contrast to previous reports, only one patient (4.7%) had an infectious etiology. Five patients were on beta-blocker therapy, but none were seen with rupture. However, eight of the remaining 16 patients (50%) without beta-blockade had rupture. Thirteen patients (62%) had calcified aneurysms, but all ruptures were seen in noncalcified aneurysms. Operative intervention occurred in 11 of the 21 patients (52%). All eight patients with rupture underwent operation, including six ligations and one successful embolization, and one patient died before completion of repair. The operative mortality rate was 37.5% for ruptured aneurysms. Elective repair included one prosthetic graft, one excision and patch angioplasty, and one embolization, with no mortality. Ten of the 21 patients (48%) with SMA aneurysms were observed, and all were alive and well at a mean of 67 months' follow-up (range, 2 to 148 months).\nSMA aneurysms are rare but appear to have a higher risk of rupture than previously reported. Male patients and patients with noncalcified aneurysms appear to have a greater risk of rupture. beta-Blockade may have some protective effect against aneurysm rupture. Intervention is reasonable in all patients at good operative risk with SMA aneurysms, considering the high rupture rate in our series.",

The mean age was 75 years, and the mean aneurysm diameter was 60.3 +/- 8.8 mm. Stent grafts were oversized 10% to 20% relative to computed tomographic (CT) scan-based diameter measurements. All repairs were performed in the operating room through surgically exposed femoral arteries. The results were assessed before discharge with three-phase, contrast-enhanced CT scan and plain abdominal radiograph. These studies were repeated at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months after operation. Follow-up periods ranged from 1 to 34 months.\nNo failed insertions and no conversions to open surgery occurred. The diameter of the main body of the stent graft was 28 mm or more in 73 patients (63%). Additional stents were inserted during surgery to treat kinking in eight patients (6.9%) and renal artery encroachment in two patients (1.7%). Mean fluoroscopy time was 35.1 +/- 18.3 minutes, contrast load was 146 +/- 53 mL (350 mg/mL), and estimated blood loss was 249 +/- 407 mL. The major complication rate was 9.5%, and the minor complication rate was 10.3%. The perioperative complications were myocardial infarction in four patients, arrythmia in four patients, and pulmonary embolism, renal failure, stroke, small bowel obstruction, femoral stenosis, digital embolism, and graft limb thrombosis in one patient each. All 116 patients went home from the hospital, but one patient died 2 weeks later of a combination of pulmonary embolism and myocardial infarction. Endoleak was seen on the first CT scan in 16 patients (15%); 15 were type II, and one was type III. No endoleaks of type I or IV were seen. Additional interventions were performed for each of the following conditions: type II endoleak (n = 4), type III endoleak (n = 1), femoral clamp injury (n = 1), renal artery stenosis (n = 1), and graft limb occlusion (n = 1). One patient had acute aneurysm dilatation and rupture caused by a type II endoleak through the inferior mesenteric artery 6 months after stent graft implantation. No cases were seen of late graft occlusion, stent graft migration, stent fracture, barb fracture, or secondary endoleak.\nThe Zenith device is safe, versatile, and effective in the short to medium term. Most patients need wide stent grafts (>or=28 mm proximally and >or=16 mm distally) to achieve 10% to 20% oversizing to prevent type I endoleak.",

    "abstract": "Arterial dissection commonly affects the thoracic aorta and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Although dissection of the abdominal aorta is considered rare, liberal use of diagnostic computed tomographic scan imaging for evaluation of abdominal pain has identified this process with increasing frequency. Because the clinical features and therapeutic options of isolated abdominal aortic dissection are not well characterized, we reviewed our recent experience and provide an algorithm for treatment.\nSince 1996, we have treated 10 patients with abdominal aortic dissection. The mean age was 62 +/- 17 years, and 40% were female. Presentation included abdominal pain in seven patients and lower extremity ischemia in one patient. Dissection was asymptomatic in two of the patients. Hypertension, smoking history, remote trauma, and claudication were noted in four, three, two, and two of the patients, respectively. Three patients had abdominal tenderness, three had a pulsatile mass, and five had a benign abdominal examination. The diagnosis of dissection was made on abdominal computed tomographic scan in eight cases, on arteriogram in one case, and at operation in one case. No patient had an associated thoracic aortic dissection. The dissection flap originated below or at the renal arteries in nine of the cases and at the superior mesenteric artery in one case. Length of the dissection ranged between 21 and 110 mm, and in three patients, the dissection flap extended beyond the aortic bifurcation into the common iliac arteries. In three patients who had an aortogram, evidence of flow limitation was found on the basis of the presence of aortic stenosis or occlusion. Treatment consisted of aortic stent graft deployment in one patient, direct aortic reconstruction in three patients, and observation in the remaining six patients.\nAlthough the natural history of isolated abdominal aortic dissection has not been well defined, our experience adds to the understanding of this rare process. Because aneurysmal degeneration can occur, close surveillance is indicated if definitive treatment is not used initially. Patients with ischemic symptoms and those with intractable pain need intervention, the nature of which should be based on risk profile and aortoiliac anatomy.",

    "abstract": "Adenoviral-mediated gene transfer to arterial and venous grafts has potential in the treatment of a number of vascular diseases. Despite widespread use of these vectors to mediate gene transfer to blood vessel walls, the optimal transduction conditions for each type of vessel has yet to be determined. Our objective was to study the effect of adenoviral titer and instillation pressure on efficiency of gene transfer to arterial and venous grafts ex-vivo.\nJugular vein and carotid artery segments of 8 cm were harvested from Yorkshire Cross pigs. Tissue culture media or different titers of an adenoviral vector encoding human placental alkaline phosphatase (hpAP) were instilled into venous and arterial grafts at 0 mm Hg or 80 to 100 mm Hg of pressure and bathed externally in the same solution at 37 degrees C for 30 minutes. The grafts were rinsed, opened longitudinally, and incubated in culture media at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. Grafts were fixed and stained for hpAP transgene expression to quantitate percent luminal transduction or homogenized for alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity to determine total transmural transduction.\nFor venous grafts, the percent luminal area stained for hpAP was greatest with 10(8) plaque-forming units/mL at 0 mm Hg (81% +/- 7%) and decreased with increasing titers (53% +/- 9% at 10(9) pfu/mL and 44% +/- 11% at 5 x 10(9) pfu/mL; n = 7; P <.05). No increase in percent luminal area stain was achieved with an instillation pressure of 80 to 100 mm Hg at any viral titer. The inverse finding was observed in arterial grafts. For arterial grafts, the greatest percent luminal area stained was achieved with 5 x 10(9) pfu/mL at 80 to 100 mm Hg (76% +/- 7%). An instillation pressure of 80 to 100 mm Hg increased the percent luminal area stained at 10(8) pfu/mL from 31% +/- 9% to 66% +/- 8% (n = 8; P =.01). For venous grafts, total AP activity peaked with 10(9) pfu/mL at 0 mm Hg and decreased with an instillation pressure of 80 to 100 mm Hg (30.6 +/- 9.7 U/mg versus 10.9 +/- 2.5 U/mg; n = 7; P <.01). However, for arterial grafts, total AP activity peaked with 5 x 10(9) pfu/mL (0 mm Hg) and increased with an instillation pressure of 80 to 100 mm Hg (32.8 +/- 9.9 U/mg versus 63.4 +/- 20.5 U/mg; n = 8; P <.05).\nHigh transduction efficiency can be achieved with adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of arterial and venous grafts. Gene transfer with the vascular graft's physiologic pressure conditions improved transduction efficiency for the artery (80 to 100 mm Hg) and vein (0 mm Hg). Comprehensive analysis of adenoviral transduction conditions is important to realize the full promise of adenoviral-mediated gene transfer.",

However, as yet, the effect of EBT on peripheral arteries is unknown.\nThis intravascular ultrasound scan (IVUS) study evaluates the effect of EBT on the extent of plaque growth and vascular remodeling after PTA of the femoropopliteal artery.\nTwenty-four patients with obstructive disease of the femoropopliteal artery underwent standard PTA. Patients were randomized to receive no additional therapy or additional EBT (192-Iridium) after PTA. IVUS investigation was performed after PTA and at 6-month follow-up. A comparison was made between patients without EBT (n = 16) and with EBT (n = 8) in the change in lumen, vessel, and plaque area and plaque dissections seen with IVUS at 6-month follow-up.\nAt follow-up, IVUS revealed a significant difference in lumen area change between patients without and with EBT (-9% and +23%, respectively; P =.03). This difference was the result of a significant difference in vessel area change (+2% and +19%, respectively; P =.05). In both groups of patients, a similar increase in plaque area (+12% and +16%, respectively; P =.80) was encountered. Plaque dissections encountered immediately after PTA were absent at follow-up in patients without EBT, whereas in four of the eight patients with EBT, a persistent dissection was encountered.\nThis randomized IVUS study showed that gamma-radiation after PTA has a positive effect on lumen dimensions at 6-month follow-up by inducing positive vascular remodeling (ie, vascular dilatation); gamma-radiation seemed not to affect plaque growth. In addition, gamma-radiation has an effect on the healing process of dissections after PTA.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism by which hypertension is maintained in renovascular hypertension remains poorly defined. Because plasma angiotensin II does not correlate with blood pressure in RVH, we postulated that activation of tissue-specific autocrine-paracrine renin-angiotensin systems may upregulate local production of angiotensin II and maintain hypertension in chronic RVH.\nRVH was induced with a two-kidney one-clip (2K1C) rat model. Animals were killed at 1 or 12 weeks after surgery (acute or chronic RVH). Angiotensin II was quantitated with radioimmunoassay. Angiotensin II-type 1 (AT(1)) receptor density was determined with immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry.\nBlood pressure was significantly elevated in 2K1C animals compared with sham animals at 1 week (141 +/- 5 mm Hg versus 98 +/- 3 mm Hg; P <.0005) and at 12 weeks (164 +/- 14 mm Hg versus 110 +/- 7 mm Hg; P <.0005) after surgery. No significant difference was seen in plasma angiotensin II levels between 2K1C and control animals during acute (38.2 +/- 6.5 fmol/mL versus 27.6 +/- 6.8 fmol/mL; P = not significant) or chronic (40.1 +/- 17.4 fmol/mL versus 27.1 +/- 6.5 fmol/mL; P = not significant) RVH. During acute RVH, intrarenal angiotensin II was significantly increased in both the clipped (126.0 +/- 16.2 fmol/g versus 62.0 +/- 6.2 fmol/g; P <.005) and unclipped (78.9 +/- 6.3 fmol/g versus 39.9 +/- 2.5 fmol/g; P <.05) kidneys of 2K1C animals compared with control animals. Increased intrarenal angiotensin II levels persisted in chronic RVH in the clipped (147.4 +/- 37.7 fmol/g versus 59.2 +/- 8.7 fmol/g; P <.05) and unclipped (130.8 +/- 31.8 fmol/g versus 63.0 +/- 11.0 fmol/g; P <.05) kidneys of 2K1C animals compared with controls. Adrenal angiotensin II content of 2K1C animals was unchanged in acute RVH (493.7 +/- 51.4 fmol/g versus 522.6 +/- 80.5 fmol/g; P = not significant) but increased nearly three-fold over control animals during chronic RVH (1129.0 +/- 149.3 fmol/g versus 400.6 +/- 59.1 fmol/g; P <.0005). No significant difference in AT(1) receptor density was noted in renal tubules of clipped and unclipped kidneys or in the adrenal glands of 2K1C animals during acute or chronic RVH compared with control animals.\nTissue angiotensin II production is upregulated in the kidneys and adrenal glands in chronic RVH, and AT(1) receptor density is maintained in these tissues, providing a potential mechanism for maintenance of hypertension in RVH.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we postulated that acute mechanical strain of the arterial wall induces changes in syndecan-4 expression that in turn may modulate cellular events, which promote neointima formation. Correlative in vivo and in vitro studies were performed to determine whether: (1) balloon injury of the rat carotid artery induces spatially and temporally regulated changes in syndecan-4 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression; (2) the application of biaxial mechanical strain to cultured vascular wall cells regulates the expression of syndecan-4 mRNA and protein and its cell surface distribution and surface shedding; and (3) shed syndecan-4 directly effects cell motility behavior. We observed that syndecan-4 mRNA and protein expression were regulated in a temporally and spatially specific manner, such that initial expression of syndecan-4 was localized to adventitial cells followed by later expression in the neointima. Notably, in vitro stimulation of isolated adventitial fibroblasts with a mechanical stretch protocol that was designed to mimic in vivo balloon injury produced a rapid increase in syndecan-4 (4.3-fold increase; P <.001) that was accompanied both by enhanced protein shedding and by the disassembly of focal adhesions. Also significant was that shed syndecan-4, induced with mechanically conditioned media, appeared to be responsible for a chemotactic response of adventitial fibroblasts (P =.005). These results indicate that mechanical strain tightly regulates syndecan-4 expression, which may, in part, provide a mechanism for the activation of myofibroblast migration from the tunica adventitia into the neointima.",

    "abstract": "Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAA) repair continues to present a surgical challenge because of obligate intraoperative visceral, renal, and spinal cord ischemia. A novel two-graft technique with a trifurcated graft for sequential visceral revascularization followed by a second graft for inline aneurysm reconstruction minimizes this endorgan ischemia. We herein present our updated experience with this approach for repair of type III and type IV TAAs.\nThirty-two patients (mean age, 70 years) underwent nonemergent repair of extent III (12 patients) and IV (20 patients) TAAs between March 1996 and October 2001. Repair was achieved with a trifurcated graft for uninvolved descending thoracic aorta-to-celiac/superior mesenteric/renal artery bypass with an additional tube or bifurcated graft for inline aneurysm reconstruction. Adjunctive cerebrospinal fluid drainage was used in the last six patients. Six patients had a solitary kidney, and six had previous infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.\nMean visceral ischemia times were as follows: celiac artery, 12 minutes; superior mesenteric artery, 12 minutes; left renal artery, 10 minutes; and right renal artery, 33 minutes. The creatinine level at discharge was not significantly different from the preoperative level (1.7 versus 1.3; P =.10). Two patients (6.3%) had transient renal failure; however, the permanent renal failure rate was zero. No patient with a solitary kidney had renal dysfunction develop. Paraplegia occurred in two patients (6.3%), one of whom had prior abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and neither of whom had cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Prolonged ventilatory support (>2 days) was necessitated in six patients (19%). The perioperative mortality rate was 6.3% (two patients). The mean follow-up period was 22 months, with a life-table survival rate of 76% at 36 months. Maintenance of preoperative functional status was achieved in 92% (23/25 patients) of long-term survivors.\nType III and IVTAA repair with a trifurcated graft for sequential visceral revascularization followed by a second graft for inline aneurysm reconstruction provides short visceral, renal, and spinal cord ischemia times and leads to low rates of endorgan ischemic damage and paraplegia. Preoperative functional status is maintained in most survivors. These results compare favorably with other methods of TAA repair, and this technique presents a useful option in thoracoabdominal aortic reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the rate of emboli (ER), as detected with transcranial Doppler scan (TCD) monitoring during and shortly after carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and early cerebrovascular complications (CVC).\nOne-hunderd eighty-five consecutive patients underwent 203 CEAs with general anesthesia at the Sint Lucas Andreas Hospital. Inclusion criteria included adequate TCD monitoring during the operation and for at least 10 minutes in the recovery room. Fifteen patients were excluded because of inadequate TCD monitoring. To prevent statistical bias, only data from the first operation of those patients who underwent bilateral CEA were included. The study group thus consisted of 170 patients (113 men, 57 women) with a mean age of 67 years (range, 45 to 83 years). The monitored TCD signals were stored on tape for offline analysis. ERs during dissection, wound closure, and the postoperative period shortly after arrival in the recovery room were studied. Preoperative and early postoperative neurologic examination, including grading with the modified Rankin scale, was performed by the same board-certified neurologist.\nA CVC occurred in 10 patients (5.9%). Five minor strokes (2.9%) and three major strokes (1.8%) occurred, one with a fatal outcome (0.6%). Two patients (1.2%) had transient ischemic attacks. Median ERs for the three periods studied were significantly different (postoperative period, 0.3/min; dissection, 0.03/min; wound closure: 0/min; Friedman, P <.005). ERs were significantly higher in the CVC group but only during wound closure (P =.0003) and the postoperative period (P <.0001). Women had significantly more CVCs than men (14% versus 2.7%; P <.02) and, during the postoperative period, had a significantly higher median ER (0.70/min) than men (0.25/min) (P <.002). High ERs during dissection in two men were associated with CVC. An ER of 0.9/min or more during the postoperative period was significantly correlated with CVC (P <.0001; odds ratio, 64.6; 95% CI, 3.7 to 1128).\nEspecially during the postoperative period, high ER is associated with early CVC. Women have a higher ER than men in this period. If the ER is 0.9/min or more during the postoperative period, there appears to be at least a nearly four-fold increased risk of CVC.",

    "abstract": "The optimal surgical management of subclavian vein effort thrombosis remains a dilemma because outcomes after different treatment strategies are only on the basis of small retrospective series. SVT treatment should be on the basis of the cause of thrombosis. Primary effort thrombosis or Paget-Schroetter syndrome frequently necessitates a surgical approach. The type of surgery has to be individualized after careful diagnostic evaluation. We report a congenital clavicular exostosis that had not been identified with chest radiograph and computed tomographic scan that caused SVT in a young woman. This unusual cause of Paget-Schroetter syndrome was treated with a unique approach.",

    "abstract": "The use of percutaneous angioplasty with subsequent intravascular metallic stent placement has gained increasing acceptance over the past decade. Infections of these stents appear to be uncommon; however, the rarity of this complication may in part be the result of a lack of availability of long-term follow-up data. A number of examples of infected cardiac and peripheral vascular stents have been reported, often with fatal consequences. Herein, we report a 74-year-old woman who underwent subclavian and brachiocephalic artery angioplasty and stent placement for symptomatic stenoses. Six months after the initial intervention, the patient returned with restenosis of the stents and underwent repeat angioplasty to restore full patency. Two weeks later, the patient was readmitted with generalized malaise and multiple erythematous, macular lesions on the right forearm and hand. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, and a computed tomographic scan of the chest showed a large brachiocephalic artery pseudoaneurysm with surrounding hematoma. Despite prompt surgical intervention, this complication proved ultimately fatal. Infections of metallic endovascular stents are potentially life-threatening complications and must be addressed urgently, including possible surgical intervention.",

    "abstract": "Autogenous vein grafts are commonly used for arterial reconstructive procedures. Their success is limited by the development of intimal hyperplasia, a fibroproliferative disease that predisposes the grafts to occlusive stenosis. Our goal was to assess whether 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)) inhibits vein graft intimal hyperplasia coincident with a reduction in monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) expression and macrophage accumulation.\nMale Lewis rats were implanted with time-release pellets that contained 0.5 mg E(2) (E5 group) or placebo (PL group). Epigastric vein to common femoral artery interposition grafts were harvested at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. We assessed macrophage/monocytes numbers, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, MCP-1, and transforming growth factor-beta1 with use of immunohistochemistry. MCP-1 message expression was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction.\nThe time-release pellets raised the serum E(2) level to greater than 250 pg/mL on the day of surgery. Serum E(2) level declined to 43 +/- 13 pg/mL by 4 weeks and to baseline by 6 weeks. We found that the neointimal area ratio was reduced significantly in the E5 group at 2 and 4 weeks (45%, P <.05, and 68%, P < 0.05, respectively) relative to that in the PL group. The number of proliferating cells was reduced in the E5 group. There was a significant attenuation of MCP-1 expression and of the number of macrophages accumulating in the graft with E(2) treatment. Furthermore, MCP-1 messenger ribonucleic acid expression was also significantly attenuated in the E5 group at 4 weeks when compared to the PL group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1.\nE(2) treatment reduces vein-graft intimal hyperplasia coincident with a reduction in MCP-1 expression, macrophage accumulation, and cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the time course of tropoelastin gene expression in the poststenotic dilatation segment of rabbit aorta with experimental coarctation.\nMidthoracic aortic coarctation was created in rabbits to produce a PSD. The time points of the study after coarctation were 1, 3, and 7 days and 2, 4, and 8 weeks (n = 3 each). Additional animals (n = 6) were subjected to hypercholesterolemia for analysis of tropoelastin expression in intimal lesions. Northern and Western blot analyses were used to quantitate tropoelastin messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein, and immunohistochemistry was used to analyze tropoelastin distribution.\nThoracic aortic coarctation produced a moderate stenosis, which resulted in PSD. mRNA levels in the PSD segment decreased at days 1 and 3, followed by an increase at 2 and 4 weeks (P <.05 versus controls). This biphasic change in tropoelastin mRNA was associated with increase in tropoelastin protein levels at 2 and 4 weeks (P <.05 versus controls). PSD diameter reached a maximum at 4 weeks and did not increase significantly thereafter. The number of medial elastic laminae in PSD was reduced slightly, but media thickness was unchanged. Intimal lesions were much smaller in the PSD segment than in the proximal segment in animals with hypertension superimposed with hypercholesterolemia. Moreover, tropoelastin protein distributed not only in the intima but also in the media of the PSD.\nTropoelastin gene expression is regulated in a biphasic pattern and precedes PSD formation.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to calculate abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) wall stresses in vivo for ruptured, symptomatic, and electively repaired AAAs with three-dimensional computer modeling techniques, computed tomographic scan data, and blood pressure and to compare wall stress with current clinical indices related to rupture risk.\nCT scans were analyzed for 48 patients with AAAs: 18 AAAs that ruptured (n = 10) or were urgently repaired for symptoms (n = 8) and 30 AAAs large enough to merit elective repair within 12 weeks of the CT scan. Three-dimensional computer models of AAAs were reconstructed from CT scan data. The stress distribution on the AAA as a result of geometry and blood pressure was computationally determined with finite element analysis with a hyperelastic nonlinear model that depicted the mechanical behavior of the AAA wall.\nPeak wall stress (maximal stress on the AAA surface) was significantly different between groups (ruptured, 47.7 +/- 6 N/cm(2); emergent symptomatic, 47.5 +/- 4 N/cm(2); elective repair, 36.9 +/- 2 N/cm(2); P =.03), with no significant difference in blood pressure (P =.2) or AAA diameter (P =.1). Because of trends toward differences in diameter, comparison was made only with diameter-matched subjects. Even with identical mean diameters, ruptured/symptomatic AAAs had a significantly higher peak wall stress (46.8 +/- 4.5 N/cm(2) versus 38.1 +/- 1.3 N/cm(2); P =.05). Maximal wall stress predicted risk of rupture better than the LaPlace equation (20.7 +/- 5.7 N/cm(2) versus 18.8 +/- 2.9 N/cm(2); P =.2) or other proposed indices of rupture risk. The smallest ruptured AAA was 4.8 cm, but this aneurysm had a stress equivalent to the average electively repaired 6.3-cm AAA.\nPeak wall stresses calculated in vivo for AAAs near the time of rupture were significantly higher than peak stresses for electively repaired AAAs, even when matched for maximal diameter. Calculation of wall stress with computer modeling of three-dimensional AAA geometry appears to assess rupture risk more accurately than AAA diameter or other previously proposed clinical indices.

    "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that a venous thromboembolism to the pulmonary arterial system (pulmonary embolism [PE]) would cause an inflammatory response within the pulmonary arterial (PA) wall marked by elevated cytokines and chemokines and an influx of inflammatory cells.\nExperimental PE was induced in 70 rats and confirmed with angiography and O(2) saturation depression, and an additional 70 rats underwent sham operations. PA and lung tissue were removed at 3 hours and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 14 days (n = 10 per time point), were analyzed for proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and underwent histologic analysis. Data were analyzed with analysis of variance and the unpaired Student t test.\nAverage gross PE resolution was 40% at 2 days, 90% at 4 days, and 100% at 6 days. Only monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels were greater in affected PAs compared with sham PAs at 3 hours, 1 day, and 2 days (137 +/- 13 pg/mg protein, 285 +/- 40 pg/mg protein, and 249 +/- 36 pg/mg protein versus 101 +/- 6 pg/mg protein, 150 +/- 36 pg/mg protein, and 92 +/- 3 pg/mg protein; P <.01 for all). Keratinocyte-derived chemokine, tissue necrosis factor, interleukin-10, nitric oxide, P-selectin, and E-selectin levels were not elevated. Neutrophils infiltrated the PA wall beginning at 3 hours, peaked at 2 days (69.4 +/- 21.7 per five high-power fields; P <.01), and returned to baseline by 8 days after PE. Macrophages peaked at 1 day after PE (29.3 +/- 6.9; P <.01) and returned to baseline by 4 days after PE. PE also was associated with a significantly increased intima to media ratio (P <.05), apparent at 4 days after PE and persisting through 14 days.\nPE is associated with an early influx of polymorphonuclears and macrophages and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 elevation within the PA wall. These are temporally associated with thrombus resolution and intimal hyperplasia. These factors may mediate these two processes after PE. This offers targets for further study with the hopes of minimizing the pathophysiologic response to PE.",

The duplex ultrasound parameter-absolute increase in PSV across the stenosis after exercise (Delta PSV(e))-was studied prospectively.\nFifty-eight legs in 53 consecutive patients with symptomatic arterial obstructive disease with borderline iliac stenosis were studied prospectively. Ultrasound velocity data collected after exercise on a bicycle ergometer at 2 W/kg during 2 minutes were judged against the assessment of the hemodynamic significance by means of intraarterial pressure measurement, before and after the administration of 50 mg papaverine.\nOn the basis of receiver operating characteristic curves traced for 43 iliac stenoses in 39 patients who finished the exercise, Delta PSV(e) > or = 1.4 m/s had optimal sensitivity of 93% (95% confidence interval [CI],.77-.99), specificity of 87% (95% CI,.60-.98), positive predictive value of 93% (95% CI,.77-.99) and negative predictive value of 87% (95% CI,.60-.98).\nThe results of this study show that Delta PSV(e) with a cutoff value of 1.4 m/s in combination with the PSV ratio improves the assessment of the hemodynamic significance of borderline iliac artery stenoses if the patient can accomplish the workload.",

    "abstract": "Avid competition bicycling may be associated with the development of external iliac artery stenosis. European studies have documented endofibrosis that primarily has affected young men. Our objective was to review the histopathologic features of obstructed external iliac arteries resected from avid competition bicyclists at a single institution.\nMedical records and microscopic slides were reviewed from all competitive bicyclists who had undergone resection and graft placement for segmental external iliac artery disease at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minn) between 1991 and 2001.\nOf seven patients (five female, two male) seen with external iliac obstructive disease, four underwent resection and graft placement and thus had specimens available for histopathologic review. Ages of these four patients, all of whom were women, ranged from 31-40 years (mean, 36 years). Claudication was the primary symptom in all four women. There were five iliac arteries involved in the four women, and pre-operative arteriography showed stenotic disease in these arteries, ranging from subtle stenosis to occlusion. Gross examination of the five resected arteries showed wall thickening and luminal narrowing, without aneurysm formation. Microscopically, luminal thrombus was observed in two arteries (one old and one recent). Intimal thickening affected four specimens (symmetric in three and asymmetric in one). Thickening was the result of smooth muscle hyperplasia, with only mild collagen or elastin deposition. Medial hypertrophy was present in three specimens (symmetric in two and asymmetric in one), one of which also contained focal calcification. Adventitial thickening was prominent in four (symmetric in two and asymmetric in two) and was due to smooth muscle hyperplasia. There was no intimal, medial, or adventitial inflammation.\nIn contrast to previous reports, iliac arteriopathy among competition bicyclists may occur in women. The microscopic lesions responsible for stenosis are more varied than the \"endofibrosis\" that has been previously documented. In addition to the intimal fibrosis and luminal thrombosis noted by others, we describe medial and adventitial responses to repetitive trauma. Accordingly, we favor the term \"external iliac arteriopathy\" for this disease entity.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article was to report our long-term results of distal vertebral artery (DVA) reconstruction.\nFrom 1978 to 2001 we performed 352 DVA reconstructions on 323 patients (177 men, 148 women; mean age, 60.0 +/- 12.1 years). Symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency were present in 332 cases (94.3%). Bypass grafting using mostly saphenous vein graft was performed in 240 cases (68.2%). In 102 cases (29.0%) the DVA was transposed into the internal carotid artery (ICA). Other techniques were used in 10 cases.\nStroke caused all 7 deaths (2.0%) in the early postoperative period. There were 5 nonfatal strokes (1.4%). Strokes were hemispheric in 7 cases (6 ipsilateral, 1 contralateral) and vertebrobasilar in 5 cases. There were 6 strokes (2.3%) in the subgroup of 264 isolated DVA reconstruction and 6 strokes (6.8%) in the subgroup of 88 procedures involving combined ICA and DVA reconstruction (P <.04). Temporary paralysis of the spinal accessory nerve occurred in 26 cases (7.4%). Intraoperative or early postoperative angiography findings were available in 341 of 345 cases (98.8%). Early postoperative occlusion occurred after 25 procedures (7.1%). Complete clinical follow-up was available for 313 (99.1%) of the postoperative survivors. Mean duration of follow-up was 99.5 +/- 62.5 months. Assessment of late patency was performed in 343 (99.4%) of 345 cases by angiography (21.2%) or duplex scanning (78.8%). A total of 65 (23.7%) patients died during follow-up. No deaths resulted from vertebrobasilar or hemispheric stroke. Cumulative Kaplan-Meier survival rate was 89.0% +/- 3.9% at 5 years and 75.4% +/- 7.1% at 10 years. Significant vertebrobasilar symptom-free rate was 94.0% +/- 3.5% at 5 years and 92.8% +/- 3.8% at 10 years. Primary patency rate was 89.3% +/- 3.6% at 5 years and 88.1% +/- 4.0% at 10 years.\nThis study clearly establishes the excellent long-term results of DVA reconstruction for the treatment of extracranial lesions of the vertebral artery. However, every effort should be made to reduce the rate of early postoperative occlusions. The subgroup of patients involving combined ICA and DVA reconstruction remains at high risk of postoperative stroke.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine whether asymptomatic patients at high risk for carotid stenosis should undergo screening Duplex ultrasound (DUS), with a view to offering carotid endarterectomy (CE) to those patients with significant stenosis.\nWe constructed a decision analysis model to evaluate the impact of an investigate-and-operate strategy, compared with medical management alone, on the risk of stroke in patients at high risk for carotid stenosis. We studied five investigate-and-operate models addressing different thresholds for intervention (in terms of degree of stenosis) and the effects of using or not using preoperative angiography.\nFor each of the strategies, under the base case conditions (30% prevalence of >50% carotid stenosis), the number needed to screen (NNS) and the number needed to treat (NNT) are high (213 to 769 and 13 to 144, respectively). The strategy of angiography for >50% stenosis and CE for >70% stenosis was harmful. Other strategies were unattractive because of unacceptably high NNT (no angiography, CE >50% stenosis), or because of unacceptably high NNS (angiography >70%, CE >70% stenosis), or both (angiography >50% stenosis, CE >50% stenosis; no angiography, CE > 70% stenosis). At 50% prevalence of >50% stenosis, two models produced more reasonable combinations of NNT and NNS: 11 and 370, respectively, for angiography >70%, CE >70% stenosis; and 27 and 286, respectively, for no angiography, CE >70% stenosis. Within the range of clinically plausible values for sensitivity and specificity of DUS, results were not greatly influenced by the measurement properties of DUS. However, angiographic or surgical rates of stroke or death were critical to the outcomes with any strategy. Only 3% to 12% of strokes in the studied population were prevented.\nScreening is acceptable only in populations at >40% to 50% risk for >50% carotid stenosis, who are surgical candidates, and who would undergo surgery if recommended. Acceptable investigate-and-operate strategies include angiography for DUS stenosis >70%, with CE if this level of stenosis is confirmed, and CE for DUS-measured stenosis >70% without angiographic confirmation. Surgery for asymptomatic carotid stenosis is unlikely to have a large impact upon the burden of stroke in society.",

    "abstract": "Semiquantitative dipyridamole myocardial perfusion scintigraphy may provide better estimates of perioperative cardiac risk than nonquantitative scintigraphy.\nThe purpose of this study was to conduct a metaanalysis of semiquantitive dipyridamole myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for the prediction of perioperative myocardial infarction and cardiac death in patients undergoing noncardiac vascular surgery.\nThe data sources used were MEDLINE (from 1975 to 1999), citation lists, and correspondence with study authors. We included studies that evaluated preoperative semiquantitative dipyridamole myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in patients undergoing noncardiac vascular surgery. For each study, we calculated results on the basis of the proportion of myocardial segments with reversible perfusion defects. The complications of interest were cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. We calculated likelihood ratios (LRs) and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for individual studies and for the combined data.\nWe identified nine studies involving a total of 1179 patients with 82 cardiac complications (complication rate, 7.0%). Most studies were grade C in quality. Normal scans significantly reduced the likelihood of perioperative cardiac complications (LR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.88). Fixed defects reduced the likelihood of complications, but the effect was not statistically significant (LR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.1). Reversibility in less than 20% of myocardial segments did not change the likelihood of perioperative cardiac complications (LR, 1.3, 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.9). LRs for increasing extents of reversibility were: 20% to 29% reversibility (LR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.6), 30% to 39% reversibility (LR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.6 to 5.1), 40% to 49% reversibility (LR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.4 to 6.2), and 50% or more reversibility (LR, 11; 95% CI, 5.8 to 20). The pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.89). Heterogeneity was found among study results, but exclusion of heterogeneous studies did not significantly change the summary results.\nReversible defects in less than 20% of myocardial segments do not significantly alter the risk of perioperative cardiac complications. Greater extents of reversibility on dipyridamole myocardial stress perfusion imaging increase the risk of perioperative complications after noncardiac vascular surgery, but the quality and amount of data regarding greater extents of reversibility are limited.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) in the general population and to correlate its clinical features with sonographically proven venous reflux.\nThe study design was a cross-sectional survey of the general population.\nAmbulatory men and women, aged 18-64 years, were selected randomly from 12 general practices. Subjects were examined for CVI. Eight segments of the deep and superficial veins were assessed for reflux by means of duplex scanning.\nA total of 1566 subjects were screened (867 women, mean age 44.8 years; 699 men, mean age 45.8 years) of whom 124 were diagnosed as having CVI: 95, grade 1; 19, grade 2; and 10, grade 3. The age-adjusted prevalence for the whole population was 9.4% in men and 6.6% in women. Prevalence of CVI correlated closely with age and sex, being 21.2% in men >50 years and 12.0% in women >50 years. Heaviness and tension, and a feeling of swelling, aching, and itching, were significantly associated with worsening grade of CVI. CVI was significantly associated with reflux in all deep and superficial segments. The frequency of reflux in both superficial and deep segments increased with the clinical severity of disease. In 30.8% of subjects with CVI in the left leg, reflux was limited to the superficial system.\nThe prevalence of CVI rises steeply with age. There is a strong correlation between venous symptoms and the presence and severity of CVI. CVI is associated in approximately one third of the subjects with incompetence limited to the superficial system and in these a good therapeutic outcome could be expected from surgery to the superficial veins. The severity of clinical features, including Basle CVI grade 1, correlates significantly with prevalence of valvular reflux in the deep and superficial systems. If leg ulcers are to be prevented by timely intervention, a better understanding of the natural history of the association between presenting features and disordered hemodynamics is required.",

    "abstract": "Driven by new technology and the trend toward minimally invasive techniques, vascular surgeons have eagerly begun performing catheter-based arterial interventional procedures, a subspecialty termed endovascular surgery. How incorporation of endovascular surgery by vascular surgeons has influenced the number of standard open peripheral vascular operations is unknown. The purpose of this observational study was to examine the effect of endovascular surgery performed by the vascular surgeons of an established vascular surgery service on the volume of open peripheral vascular operations performed.\nWith our prospective vascular registry, we compared the number of index vascular procedures from 1996 to 1998 (immediately before the start of an endovascular program) with the numbers from 1999 to 2000 (immediately after the start of an endovascular program). Differences in proportions (endovascular versus open/standard) between the two time periods were compared with the chi(2) test for homogeneity.\nFrom 1996 to 1998, 122 procedures were referred to radiology for arterial intervention versus none from 1999 to 2000, reflecting the initiation of the endovascular program. During the entire study period, annual volume (endovascular + open/standard) of vascular procedures, excluding the procedures referred to radiology, increased by 70% (1996, n = 402; to 2000, n = 685). Although open procedures from 1996 to 1999 increased 49% (n = 356 to n = 531), the number decreased by 5% from 1999 to 2000 (n = 531 to n = 507). In contrast, the endovascular volume from 1996 to 2000 increased 324% (n = 42 to n = 178). A statistically significant reduction was seen over time in the proportion of open/standard cases to endovascular cases in comparison of 1996 to 1998 with 1999 to 2000 for total cases (n = 1539, 88% open; versus n = 1341, 77% open) and for all index procedures (aortoiliac, 70% versus 55%; abdominal aortic aneurysm, 100% versus 63%; brachiocephalic, 73% versus 47%; renal, 60% versus 24%) except carotid procedures (100% versus 99%) and femoral-popliteal/tibial procedures (87% versus 87%).\nThe integration of endovascular procedures by vascular surgeons of an established vascular practice significantly reduced the proportion of all open vascular procedures except for carotid and femoral-popliteal/tibial intervention. These data may have important implications for the future training of general and vascular surgeons.",

    "abstract": "The role of iliac artery angioplasty and stenting (IAS) for the treatment of limb-threatening ischemia is not defined. IAS has been used primarily for patients with disabling claudication. Because poorer results have been shown in patients with critical ischemia after iliac artery angioplasty, the purpose of this study was to estimate the influence of risk factors on the outcome of iliac angioplasty and stent placement in patients with limb-threatening ischemia.\nDuring a 5-year period (from 1996 to 2001), 85 iliac angioplasty and stent placement procedures (107 stents) were performed in 31 women and 43 men with limb-threatening ischemia. Patients with claudication were specifically excluded. The criteria prepared by the Ad Hoc Committee on Reporting Standards (Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery) were followed to define the variables. The TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus classification was used to characterize the type of iliac lesions. Both univariate (Kaplan-Meier [KM]) and multivariate analyses (Cox proportional hazards model) were used to determine the association between variables, cumulative patency, limb salvage, and survival.\nIndications for iliac angioplasty with stenting were ischemic rest pain (56%) and tissue loss (44%). Primary stenting was performed in 36 patients (42%). Stents were placed selectively after iliac angioplasty mainly for residual stenosis or pressure gradient (43%). Overall, primary stent patency rate was 90% at 1 year, 74% at 3 years, and 69% at 5 years. Primary stent patency rate was significantly reduced in women compared with men (KM, log-rank test, P <.001). Primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 79%, 57%, and 38% for women and 92%, 88%, and 88% for men. Primary stent patency rate also was significantly reduced in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine level, >1.6 mg/dL; KM, log-rank test, P <.001). Cox regression analysis identified female gender (relative risk, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8 to 7.9; P =.002) and renal insufficiency (relative risk, 6.6; 95% CI, 1.6 to 14.2; P =.01) as independent predictors of decreased primary stent patency. No independent predictors for limb salvage and survival were identified.\nWomen undergoing iliac angioplasty and stenting for limb-threatening ischemia have significantly reduced primary stent patency rates and may need additional procedures to obtain satisfactory clinical improvement and limb salvage. Patients with renal insufficiency and critical ischemia also have reduced primary stent patency rates after IAS. Limb salvage, as shown in this study, is not affected by previous iliac stent failure.",

    "abstract": "Hypogastric artery embolization (HAE) is often performed in endovascular aortoiliac aneurysm repair to prevent potential endoleak, and this can be associated with pelvic ischemic sequelae. This prospective study was performed to evaluate the clinical outcome of HAE in patients who underwent endovascular aortoiliac aneurysm repair.\nDuring a 15-month period, 12 patients who underwent either unilateral or bilateral HAE for endovascular aortoiliac aneurysm repair were prospectively evaluated. All patients underwent preoperative and postoperative penile pressure measurement and pulse-volume recording evaluation. Angiographic features relating to pelvic collaterals and clinical outcomes relating to pelvic ischemia were evaluated.\nUnilateral HAE was performed in eight patients (67%), and bilateral HAE was performed in four patients (33%). Mean reductions in penile brachial index (PBI) after unilateral and bilateral HAE were 13 +/- 6% (not significant) and 39 +/- 14% (P <.05), respectively. Erectile dysfunction occurred in three patients for unilateral HAE (38%) and in two patients for bilateral HAE (50%), with an overall PBI reduction of 36 +/- 12% (P <.01). No significant change in thigh brachial or ankle brachial index occurred after HAE. Hip and buttock claudication occurred in four patients for unilateral HAE (50%) and in two patients for bilateral HAE (50%), with an overall PBI reduction of 18 +/- 9% (P <.05). Other associated pelvic ischemic complications after bilateral HAE included one scrotal skin sloughing (25%) that occurred 3 days after aortic endografting and one sacral decubitus (25%) that occurred 4 months after aortic endografting. With analysis of angiographic collateral patterns, diseased profunda femoral artery (PFA; >50% stenosis) was noted in four patients, all in whom post-HAE pelvic ischemic symptoms developed (P <.05). In contrast, only four of the remaining eight patients with normal or mild PFA disease had pelvic ischemic sequelae after HAE.\nErectile dysfunction after HAE correlates with significant reduction in PBI. Severe pelvic ischemic symptoms are more likely to occur after bilateral HAE, which should be avoided if possible. Moreover, patients with diseased PFA are at risk of development of pelvic ischemia after HAE. Our data suggest a potential role of concomitant profundapalsty at the time of aortic endografting to improve pelvic collateral flow and reduce pelvic ischemia in this subset of patients with HAE.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of endovascular repair (ER) for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has provided surgeons with a new technique that should ideally improve patient outcomes. To more accurately characterize the advantages of ER versus traditional/open AAA repair (TOR), we compared the preoperative medical risk factors (PMRFs) and perioperative outcomes (PO) of those patients undergoing elective treatment of infrarenal AAA with ER and TOR over a recent 18-month period at our center.\nThrough our institutional vascular surgery patient registry, all patients undergoing aortic aneurysm repair of any type between December 1999 and June 2001 were identified. Only those patients undergoing elective infrarenal AAA repair were analyzed. Hospital records were examined for all patients, and PMRF and PO were assessed via Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery reporting guidelines. Student t, chi(2), Fisher exact, or Wilcoxon rank sum tests were applied where appropriate to determine differences among PMRF and PO according to method of aneurysm repair.\nDuring the 18-month study period, a total of 199 aortic aneurysms were repaired at our institution. Ninety-nine elective infrarenal AAA repairs made up the study cohort (ER, n = 33; TOR, n = 66). When examined by method of aneurysm repair, no differences existed in demographics or AAA size. Patients undergoing ER had a significantly greater degree of preoperative pulmonary comorbidity than patients undergoing TOR (P <.001). However, no differences existed in terms of American Society of Anesthesiologists classification or cardiac (P =.52), cerebrovascular (P =.44), diabetic (P =.51), hypertensive (P =.90), hyperlipidemia (P =.91) or renal (P =.23) comorbidities between the two groups. Perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were also not significantly different by method of repair. ER was associated with shorter operative time, intensive care unit stay, and overall hospital length of stay (P <.0001). However, subsequent operative procedures related to the AAA repair were performed more frequently after ER (TOR = 1.5% versus ER = 15.2%; P = 0.015).\nThese results suggest that ER offers improvements in hospital convalescent and operating room times but no beneficial impact on overall morbidity and mortality rates when similar PMRFs exist, especially when used at medical centers where low morbidity and mortality rates are already established for TOR. Other centers performing ER should undertake such an analysis to assess its impact on their patients.",

    "abstract": "Type II endoleak after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is a failure of aneurysm sac exclusion with unknown long-term consequences. Elevated aneurysm sac pressures documented in these patients have led us to aggressively treat type II endoleaks with percutaneous transluminal coil embolization (PTCE). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results and the mechanisms of failure of PTCE for type II endoleak.\nOne hundred ninety-one patients underwent endograft repair of infrarenal aortic aneurysms. Twenty-three of 28 patients with persistent primary (>3 months) or secondary (new-onset) endoleak underwent angiography; 14 of these patients had type II endoleaks. We reviewed our endovascular registry data, hospital charts, and radiologic studies of patients with type II endoleaks and analyzed the results in those treated with PTCE of the inflow vessel.\nAll 14 patients with type II endoleaks were men, with a mean age of 76.7 years and a mean preoperative maximal aneurysm diameter of 5.7 +/- 1.0 cm. The type II endoleak was primary in 12 patients (86%) and secondary in two patients (14%) and iliolumbar in 11 patients (78%) and mesenteric in three patients (21%). Although a dominant affluent collateral channel (inosculation) was apparent in eight patients (57%), six patients (43%) showed a network of collateral vessels (retiform anastomosis). In six patients (43%), angiography revealed a second or \"outflow\" vessel indicative of a complex endoleak. In four patients with retiform iliolumbar type II endoleaks, PTCE was not attempted because of the retiform nature of the endoleak. The remaining 10 patients underwent PTCE, with coil deployment in all 10 and apparent initial technical success in nine patients. Follow-up computed tomographic scans revealed persistent endoleaks in six patients (60%). Mechanisms of failure included persistent flow through the coils in the treated vessel in two patients, development of a retiform anastomosis around the coiled vessel in three patients, and development of a new mesenteric endoleak after successful occlusion of an iliolumbar endoleak in one patient. Two patients underwent repeat PTCE with successful aneurysm sac exclusion in one. Internal iliac artery injury complicated one of the 12 PTCEs, and the resulting pseudoaneurysm was successfully treated with PTCE. Angiographic visualization of an outflow vessel (complex endoleak) was associated with PTCE failure (P =.008).\nPTCE of type II endoleaks has a high failure rate because of multiple anatomic mechanisms.",

The type II endoleak was primary in 12 patients (86%) and secondary in two patients (14%) and iliolumbar in 11 patients (78%) and mesenteric in three patients (21%). Although a dominant affluent collateral channel (inosculation) was apparent in eight patients (57%), six patients (43%) showed a network of collateral vessels (retiform anastomosis). In six patients (43%), angiography revealed a second or \"outflow\" vessel indicative of a complex endoleak. In four patients with retiform iliolumbar type II endoleaks, PTCE was not attempted because of the retiform nature of the endoleak. The remaining 10 patients underwent PTCE, with coil deployment in all 10 and apparent initial technical success in nine patients. Follow-up computed tomographic scans revealed persistent endoleaks in six patients (60%). Mechanisms of failure included persistent flow through the coils in the treated vessel in two patients, development of a retiform anastomosis around the coiled vessel in three patients, and development of a new mesenteric endoleak after successful occlusion of an iliolumbar endoleak in one patient. Two patients underwent repeat PTCE with successful aneurysm sac exclusion in one. Internal iliac artery injury complicated one of the 12 PTCEs, and the resulting pseudoaneurysm was successfully treated with PTCE. Angiographic visualization of an outflow vessel (complex endoleak) was associated with PTCE failure (P =.008).",

    "abstract": "Positional stability of the endograft is essential for long-term durability after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EAR). However, the cumulative risk of delayed endograft migration has been sparsely reported.\nA total of 91 patients studied underwent EAR with the AneuRx endograft with a minimum 1 year from implantation. Data from a prospective database were assessed for proximal endograft migration, defined as > or = 5 mm change from the initial endograft position. Multiple anatomic characteristics were also examined. Sixty-nine patients were alive, with complete follow-up at 1 year, with a mean time from implantation of 33.2 +/- 1.1 months. Data are mean +/- SEM.\nEndograft migration occurred in 15 patients, giving a cumulative event rate of 7.2% (5/69) at 1 year, 20.4% (10/49) at 2 years, 42.1% (8/19) at 3 years, and 66.7% (2/3) at 4 years post-EAR (P =.01). Although the initial aortic neck diameter did not differ between the groups (21.5 +/- 0.6 mm vs 21.8 +/- 0.3 mm, P =.61), significant (P <.05), late aortic neck enlargement was seen in patients with migration (25.0 +/- 1.6 mm, 26.2 +/- 1.2 mm, and 27.0 +/- 1.0 mm at 1,2, and 3 years, respectively) but not in nonmigrators. Regression analysis demonstrated a statistically significant (P <.05) correlation between endograft oversizing and late aortic neck dilation. Overall migration risk was 29.2% in patients oversized >20% and 18.6% in patients oversized < or = 20%. Aortic neck angulation (23.4 +/- 6.6 degrees vs 23.5 +/- 3.3 degrees, P =.99), aortic neck length (25.9 +/- 2.5 mm vs 27.0 +/- 1.6 mm, P =.74), initial endograft/aortic neck overlap (18.6 +/- 2.6 mm vs 19.4 +/- 1.4 mm, P =.80) and size of abdominal aortic aneurysm (55.5 +/- 1.5 mm vs 54.9 +/- 1.4 mm, P =.84) were similar between migrators and nonmigrators, respectively. Secondary endovascular treatment with aortic cuffs was required in five patients with device migration.\nDevice migration after EAR with the AneuRx endograft occurred with significant frequency, the incidence of which increased with the length of follow-up. Late aortic neck dilation was significantly associated with migration. Oversizing of the endograft of >20% may accelerate this late aortic neck dilation. However, the etiologies of endograft migration were likely multifactorial, as the majority (8/15) of patients experiencing migration were oversized <20%. Although endovascular repair of these migrations is usually possible, the long-term durability of these secondary procedures is unknown. Careful surveillance for this endograft failure mode must be an essential component of post-EAR follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have reported success in the use of venous homografts for arteriovenous access and for arterial bypass in infected fields. On the basis of these reports and in an effort to prevent the loss of vascular access to infection, we performed arteriovenous graft placement with cryopreserved femoral vein in patients at high risk for graft infection. This study reviews the results of our experience.\nOf approximately 3100 dialysis access operations performed in a single vascular surgery service between October 1999 and July 2001, 20 patients received arteriovenous access grafts with cryopreserved femoral vein. All patients were judged to be at high risk for infection of the access on the basis of the presence of active infection at the time of graft implantation, the location of the graft in the thigh position, or a history of multiple access infections. The grafts were placed in three locations: thigh (n = 14), upper extremity (n = 3), and chest wall (n = 3).\nNo early operative deaths or graft thromboses were seen. There were three late deaths: two from cardiac disease and one from a graft-related complication. Thirteen major graft related complications (65%) occurred in the 20 patients. There were three generalized graft infections (15%) and eight localized graft infections (40%) at dialysis needle access sites in 11 patients. Six of the graft infections were associated with graft rupture and frank hemorrhage, resulting in one patient death from exsanguination. Two grafts (10%) thrombosed, one of which was salvaged after thrombectomy and revision. These complications occurred between 1 and 14 months after implantation. At a mean follow-up period of 13 months (range, 1 to 17 months), only five of the 20 patients (25%) have a functioning cryopreserved femoral vein arteriovenous graft.\nThe use of cryopreserved vein graft for hemodialysis access in patients at high risk for infection is associated with a high incidence rate of graft infection and rupture, particularly when placed in the thigh position. The routine use of cryopreserved vein graft in the thigh should be avoided. The in situ replacement of infected polytetrafluoroethylene arteriovenous grafts with cryopreserved vein should be considered if alternative sites for new access placement are unavailable.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate an algorithm to maximize native arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) for hemodialysis access.\nThe prospective study design was set in an academic, tertiary care medical center. The study subjects were adults referred for permanent, upper extremity hemodialysis access between April 1999 and May 2001. Intervention included Doppler arterial pressures/waveforms and duplex imaging of the basilic, cephalic, and central veins. The optimal configuration for an AVF was determined (criteria: vein >3 mm, no arterial inflow stenosis, no venous outflow stenosis) on the basis of the noninvasive studies, and unilateral arteriography/venography was performed to confirm the choice. Permanent hemodialysis access was created on the basis of the imaging studies, and remedial imaging/intervention was performed if the AVF failed to mature. Outcome measures included impact of the noninvasive/invasive imaging, perioperative morbidity/mortality, incidence of successful AVF, time to cannulation, and predictors of AVF failure with multivariate analysis.\nA total of 139 new access procedures was performed in 131 patients (age, 53 +/- 16 years; male, 51%; white, 60%; diabetic, 49%; actively undergoing dialysis, 50%; prior permanent access, 26%). The noninvasive imaging showed that 83% of the patients were candidates for AVF, with a mean of 2.7 +/- 2.1 possible configurations. Invasive imaging was abnormal in 38% (forearm arterial disease > central vein stenosis > inflow stenosis) and impacted the operative plan in 19%. AVF were performed in 90% of the cases (brachiobasilic > brachiocephalic > radiocephalic > radiobasilic), with prosthetic AVF performed primarily because of inadequate veins. Among the patients who underwent AVF, the 30-day mortality rate was 1%, the complication rate was 20% (wound, 10%; hand ischemia, 8%), and 24% needed a remedial procedure. The AVF matured sufficiently for cannulation in 84% of those with sufficient follow-up and was suitable for cannulation by 3.4 +/- 1.8 months. On the basis of an intention to treat approach, an AVF sufficient for cannulation developed in 71% of the 139 cases referred for access. The multivariate analysis predicted that female gender (odds ratio, 9.7; 95% CI, 2.2 to 43.5) and the radiocephalic configuration (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 18.6) were both independent predictors of failure of the fistula to mature.\nWith the aggressive algorithm, the construction of native AVF is possible in the overwhelming majority of patients presenting for new hemodialysis access.",

The noninvasive imaging showed that 83% of the patients were candidates for AVF, with a mean of 2.7 +/- 2.1 possible configurations. Invasive imaging was abnormal in 38% (forearm arterial disease > central vein stenosis > inflow stenosis) and impacted the operative plan in 19%. AVF were performed in 90% of the cases (brachiobasilic > brachiocephalic > radiocephalic > radiobasilic), with prosthetic AVF performed primarily because of inadequate veins. Among the patients who underwent AVF, the 30-day mortality rate was 1%, the complication rate was 20% (wound, 10%; hand ischemia, 8%), and 24% needed a remedial procedure. The AVF matured sufficiently for cannulation in 84% of those with sufficient follow-up and was suitable for cannulation by 3.4 +/- 1.8 months. On the basis of an intention to treat approach, an AVF sufficient for cannulation developed in 71% of the 139 cases referred for access. The multivariate analysis predicted that female gender (odds ratio, 9.7; 95% CI, 2.2 to 43.5) and the radiocephalic configuration (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 18.6) were both independent predictors of failure of the fistula to mature.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to estimate the population-based prevalence of renovascular disease (RVD), defined as > or = 60% diameter-reducing renal artery stenosis or occlusion, and to define its associations with age, gender, race, and other potential risk factors among participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS).\nThe CHS is a multicenter, longitudinal cohort study of cardiovascular disease risk factors, morbidity, and mortality among free-living adults of more than 65 years of age. As part of an ancillary investigation, participants in the Forsyth County cohort of the CHS were invited to undergo renal duplex sonography (RDS) to define the presence or absence of RVD. RVD was defined as stenosis with a focal renal artery peak systolic velocity exceeding 1.8 m/s in the main renal artery and defined as occlusion when an imaged renal artery lacked a Doppler signal. Demographic and atherosclerotic risk factor data were gathered as part of the baseline CHS examination. Univariable tests of association were performed with chi(2) and Student t tests and logistic regression analysis. Multivariate associations were examined with logistic regression analysis.\nEight hundred seventy CHS participants underwent RDS. Of these examinations, 834 (96%) were technically adequate to define the presence or absence of RVD. The RDS study cohort had a mean age of 77.2 +/- 4.9 years and consisted of 63% women and 37% men. Participant race was 76% white and 23% African American. The overall prevalence rate of RVD was 6.8%. Among the 57 patients with RVD, 50 (88%) had unilateral disease and seven (12%) had bilateral disease. Seven cases were seen of renal artery occlusion, including one case with contralateral renal artery stenosis. The mean ages of patients with and without RVD were 78.7 +/- 5.7 years and 77.1 +/- 4.9 years (P =.018). RVD was present in 5.5% of women and 9.1% of men (P =.053). RVD was present in 6.9% of white participants and 6.7% of African American participants (P =.933). Multivariate analysis revealed increasing participant age (P =.028; odds ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03, 1.73), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of less than 40 mg/dL (P =.003; odds ratio, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.40, 4.93), and increasing systolic blood pressure (P =.007; odds ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.10, 1.87) to be significantly and independently associated with the presence of RVD.\nThis investigation provides the first population-based estimate of the prevalence of RVD among free-living, elderly black and white Americans. RVD was present in 6.8% of the study cohort. RVD showed no association with ethnicity. However, its presence was significantly and independently associated with increasing age, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and increasing systolic blood pressure.",

This study analyzes the natural history of 60% to 69% ACS according to ultrasonic plaque morphology and its implication on treatment.\nDuring a 2-year period, patients with 60% to 69% ACS entered into a protocol of carotid duplex scan surveillance/clinical examination every 6 months. The ultrasonic plaque morphology was classified as heterogeneous (group A, n = 162) or homogeneous (group B, n = 229) with HDI 3000/HDI 5000 systems (Advanced Technology Laboratories, Bothwell, Wash). CEA was done if lesion progressed to > or = 70% stenosis or became symptomatic.\nThree hundred eighty-two patients (391 arteries) were followed for a mean interval of 37 months. The clinical/demographic characteristics were similar for both groups. The incidence rate of future ipsilateral strokes was significantly higher in group A than in group B: 13.6% versus 3.1% (P =.0001; odds ratio [OR], 5). Similarly, the incidence rate of all neurologic events (stroke or transient ischemic attack [TIA]) was higher in group A than in group B: 27.8% versus 6.6% (P =.0001; OR, 5.5). Progression to > or = 70% stenosis was also higher in group A than in group B: 25.3% versus 6.1% (P =.0001; OR, 5.2).

    "abstract": "The role of intraluminal thrombus (ILT) on abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture is still not clear. Rupture of an aneurysm occurs when the wall stress exceeds the wall strength at any location on the wall. The purpose of this study was to address the hypothesis that the presence of ILT alters the wall stress distribution or wall stress magnitude in AAA.\nPatient-specific 3D AAA geometries were reconstructed from computed tomographic images. Two geometric features, ILT surface ratio (ILT surface area divided by the total AAA surface area) and ILT volume ratio (ILT volume divided by the total AAA volume), were calculated for each AAA. Two models were created for each patient: one with ILT and one without ILT. Systolic pressure measured at the time of computed tomographic imaging was applied to the internal surface of each model. A nonlinear large deformation algorithm was used to compute wall stress distribution with the finite element method. The Wilcoxon matched pairs test was used to compare the peak wall stress between the two models of each patient.\nFour patients were studied with ILT surface ratios that ranged from 0.29 to 0.72 and ILT volume ratios that ranged from 0.12 to 0.66. The peak wall stress was reduced (range, 6% to 38% reduction; P =.067) for all models with ILT included (range, 28 to 37 N/cm(2)) as compared with models with no ILT (range, 30 to 44 N/cm(2)). Visual inspection also revealed a marked effect of ILT on the wall stress distribution.\nThe presence of ILT alters the wall stress distribution and reduces the peak wall stress in AAA. For this reason, ILT should be included in all patient-specific models of AAA for evaluation of AAA wall stresses.",

    "abstract": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has proven to be effective in the prevention of stroke in patients with significant internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. However, whether increased cerebral blood flow after CEA improves the cerebral metabolism in patients with asymptomatic ICA flow lesions is unknown. Localized in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) has been used to measure the metabolic status of the human brain in a totally noninvasive manner. The aim of this study was to investigate the cerebral metabolism after CEA in patients with asymptomatic ICA flow lesions and no visible infarction on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nWe designed a prospective study to investigate the metabolic changes in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory with (1)H-MRS for 18 consecutive patients with asymptomatic severe stenosis of the ICA (>70% reduction in diameter) and for 16 healthy control subjects. The 18 patients with ICA flow lesion and no visible infarction on MRI who underwent CEA were evaluated before and 7 days after surgery (CEA group). The 16 control subjects had never had a cerebral event, and brain MRI and carotid duplex scan study results were normal in all (control group).\nPreoperative ICA volume flow was severely decreased to less than 150 mL/min in all 18 patients, in comparison with our laboratory normal value of matched age group of 250 to 300 mL/min. After CEA, ICA volume flow was increased to greater than 300 mL/min in all patients (P =.00). For patients in the CEA group, preoperative N-acetylaspartate/creatine and choline/creatine ratios in the MCA territory were slightly decreased compared with the healthy subjects in the control group but were within normal limits. However, the postoperative values of N-acetylaspartate/creatine and choline/creatine ratios in the ipsilateral MCA territory were significantly increased as compared with the preoperative values (P <.05). In the contralateral side, the postoperative increase of choline/creatine ratio and the decrease of myo-inositol/creatine ratio were statistically significant as compared with the preoperative values (P <.05).\nCEA seems to improve the cerebral metabolic status in patients with asymptomatic ICA flow lesions and no visible infarction on MRI.",

We describe a case report of WG complicated by subclavian artery aneurysm and review the literature on large-vessel and medium-vessel aneurysms in WG. The involved arteries included the aorta and the hepatic, renal, and left gastric arteries. In all but one case, abdominal pain was the presenting symptom. Treatment included medical and vascular interventions. In two patients, the involved vessel ruptured, leading to massive hemorrhage and death. We concluded that unexplained abdominal pain or extremity ischemia in patients with WG should alert the physician to the possibility of a large-vessel or medium-vessel aneurysm.",

The condition is considered a life-threatening emergency as a result of the complications associated with severe hypertension. Diagnosis is best made with angiography. Surgical bypass grafting is the optimal method of treatment and must be tailored depending on the distribution of disease.

Accurate localization and correction of the embolic source is paramount for the prevention of further episodes and for the preservation of long-term patency and limb salvage. Common well-recognized embolic sources include intracardiac thrombus or myxoma, and thrombus within arterial aneurysms or complex atherosclerotic plaques. Less common is thrombus arising de novo in an otherwise normal aorta, possibly as a result of prior trauma, occult arteriopathy, and/or hypercoagulability. Reported herein are three cases of peripheral or mesenteric embolization arising from large thrombi within the visceral aortic segment, with minimal evidence for atherosclerosis or other aortic pathology. Each patient was treated with visceral aortic thrombectomy using a direct surgical approach.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a significant risk factor for atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease. Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, as encountered in patients with type II diabetes, have been shown to stimulate vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, a paramount feature in atherosclerosis. Female sex hormones, such as estrogen, have been suggested to inhibit VSMC proliferation. However, the role of progesterone, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, has not been examined. Therefore, we studied the effect of progesterone on VSMCs exposed to various concentrations of glucose and insulin.\nHuman infragenicular VSMCs isolated from the tibial arteries of five male patients with diabetes undergoing lower extremity amputation were used. Immunocytochemical studies with confocal microscopy were performed for progesterone receptor identification in these VSMCs. Cells were grown to subconfluence, followed by exposure to deprived media with various glucose (100 and 200 mg/dL) and insulin (no insulin and 100 ng/mL) concentrations. Cells were then additionally exposed to physiologic progesterone (10 ng/mL, progesterone group) and compared with a no-progesterone group. Cell count and methyl-(3)H-thymidine incorporation were used to determine cellular proliferation. Cell count with hemocytometry was performed on day 6. DNA synthesis as reflected through methyl-(3)H-thymidine incorporation was measured at 24 hours.\nImmunocytochemical studies with confocal microscopy showed cytosolic progesterone receptors. The no-progesterone group showed a significant rise in cell count (P <.05) at all concentrations of glucose or insulin compared with the control group containing 100 mg/dL glucose concentration. The no-progesterone group also showed a significant rise in thymidine incorporation (P <.05) in the 100 mg/dL glucose-100 ng/mL insulin group and the 200 mg/dL glucose-100 ng/mL insulin group compared with the 100 mg/dL glucose group. In the cell count studies, progesterone significantly inhibited cellular proliferation in several settings. All cell groups cultured with insulin or an elevated glucose concentration showed a significant (P <.05) antiproliferative effect when exposed to progesterone. With thymidine incorporation, progesterone showed a similar antiproliferative effect in cells stimulated with glucose or insulin.\nSignificant reductions in cell proliferation as determined with both cell count and thymidine incorporation suggest that progesterone is an inhibitor of VSMC proliferation induced by our in vitro models of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Therefore, progesterone may have a protective role against the atherosclerotic changes associated with type II diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Neointimal hyperplasia remains a principal cause of vein graft failure. Genetic contributions to vein graft neointimal hyperplasia could be well studied in the mouse; however, surgical approaches to vein bypass surgery in the mouse have yet to replicate approaches commonly employed in human patients. Consequently, the goal of this study was to develop a murine interposition vein graft model that reproduces characteristics of human vein graft disease.\nUsing C57BL/6J mice, we excised inferior venae cavae (IVCs) from donor mice and grafted them, with end-to-side anastomosis, into the carotid circulation of recipients. IVC grafts were harvested from 3 to 56 days postoperatively, and analyzed for the development of neointima and media.\nThickening of both the vein graft neointima and media progressed rapidly between postoperative weeks 1 and 4, and reached steady state levels by approximately week four, with a graft-wall thickness of 91 +/- 4 microm (14 cell layers), a lumen area of 0.56 mm(2), an average neointima-media ratio of 0.4 to 0.6, and a predominance of alpha-smooth muscle actin-staining cells. Comprising predominately smooth muscle actin-expressing cells, the neointima was 50% thicker in the proximal than in the distal third of the grafts (P <.001), but proximal and distal vein graft anastomoses were widely patent.\nIn syngeneic murine carotid interposition IVC grafts implanted with end-to-side anastomoses, moderate, nonocclusive neointimal hyperplasia reaches steady state after the fourth postoperative week. This neointimal hyperplasia, like that of human grafts, predominates near vein graft anastomoses. This vein graft model should facilitate genetic analyses of the pathogenesis of neointimal hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "Cystic medial degeneration (CMD) is a histologic abnormality that is common in aortic diseases such as aortic dilation, aneurysm, or dissection. Although little is known about the mechanism underlying CMD, we have previously demonstrated that angiotensin II signaling via angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) plays a central role in apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) occurring in CMD associated with Marfan syndrome. The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of angiotensin II signaling in THE pathogenesis of aortic diseases associated with CMD.\nWe investigated the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), temocapril (n = 15), angiotensin II receptor type-1 (AT1R) blocker, CS-866 (n = 15), and vehicle control (n = 17) on 0.25% beta-aminopropionitrile monofumarate (BAPN)-induced aortic dissection and histopathologic findings in a rat model.\nTemocapril significantly prevented aortic dissection (P <.05), CMD (P <.01), and VSMC apoptosis (P <.01) compared with vehicle control in BAPN-fed rats. However, CS-866 did not show any preventive effect. Reversed transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that expression of both AT1R and AT2R was detected in control rat aortas, and that AT2R expression was significantly upregulated in the aortas of BAPN-fed rats (P <.01). Blood pressure was significantly and equally lowered in both temocapril and CS-866 groups compared with control.\nDifferential expression of angiotensin II receptors and AT2R signaling are involved in the pathogenesis of CMD and aortic dissection in BAPN-fed rats. ACEIs might be of clinical value for the prevention and treatment of aortic diseases related to CMD.",

Pressure transducers were inserted into the aneurysm. Group I (n = 4) underwent endovascular stent graft exclusion of the aneurysm. An attachment site failure was formed in group II (n = 5) before aneurysm exclusion. ASP measurements were obtained for 3 weeks, and the ratio of mean ASP to mean systemic blood pressure (ASP/BP) was calculated. Before explant, norepinephrine was administered and ASPs were recorded at varying systemic pressures. Stent graft cuff exclusion of the attachment site failure was performed in group II.\nIntraoperative arteriography and duplex ultrasonagraphy did not reveal an endoleak in either group. ASP/BP in group I was 0.39 +/- 0.02 compared with 1.01 +/- 0.02 in group II (P <.001). Mean systemic pressure varied from 55 to 177 mm Hg after norepinephrine administration. Within this interval, ASP/BP was 0.51 +/- 0.10 in group I compared with 0.91 +/- 0.10 in group II (P <.001). ASP/BP before cuff deployment in group II was 0.98 +/- 0.08 compared with 0.46 +/- 0.04 after cuff deployment (P <.001).\nSystemic pressure is transmitted to the aneurysm sac through an attachment site failure, despite no endoleak, resulting in endotension.

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional time-of-flight (3D TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is generally considered to overestimate the degree of stenosis in the internal carotid artery (ICA) in comparison with the reference standard intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA). We evaluated whether the degree of stenosis was more accurately assessed with 3D TOF MRA if corresponding projections on MRA and DSA were compared instead of comparison of maximal stenosis at MRA with maximal stenosis at DSA.\nFrom February 1997 to December 1999, we included 186 symptomatic and 17 asymptomatic consecutive patients suspected of having carotid artery stenosis on the basis of clinical presentation and screening with duplex ultrasound scan examination. All patients subsequently underwent DSA and MRA imaging. From each ICA, 12 maximum intensity projections with 3D TOF MRA and two or three projections with DSA were obtained. First, we compared the maximal stenosis at MRA with the maximal stenosis at DSA. Subsequently, we used the stenosis at MRA measured on the projection corresponding with the DSA projection that showed the maximal stenosis. For both strategies, the mean differences in stenosis and sensitivity and specificity for assessment of severe stenosis (70% to 99%) were calculated and compared.\nThe MRA and DSA images of 354 ICAs could be compared. The sensitivity and specificity of MRA with the projection that showed the maximal stenosis were 92.6% (95% CI, 85.3% to 97.0%) and 82.7% (95% CI, 78.1% to 87.3%), respectively.

The mean difference between maximal stenosis at MRA and DSA was 7.5% (95% CI, 5.2% to 9.9%). The mean difference between stenosis at MRA and DSA in corresponding projections was 0.4% (95% CI, -2.0% to 2.7%).\nIf corresponding MRA and intraarterial DSA projections are compared, 3D TOF MRA does not overestimate carotid stenosis.",

    "abstract": "Blood pressure instability after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been associated with a disturbance of the baroreflex control mechanism caused by the surgery in the carotid sinus region. The purpose of this study was to determine if a deterioration in carotid baroreceptors occurs during the surgery.\nHeart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were recorded continuously in 60 patients undergoing CEA as well as preoperatively and postoperatively at 2 days and 6 weeks. The baroreflex sensitivity was determined by cross-spectral analysis of HR and systolic blood pressure (SBP). During the surgery, three tests were used to assess the baroreflex response. The first test simulated a sudden fall in systemic blood pressure by clamping the common carotid artery. The second test simulated a rise in systemic blood pressure by applying pressure by using a rubbing action on the luminal surface of the carotid sinus region. The rub test was performed twice, once with the atheromatous plaque in situ and once when the plaque had been removed. The third test is clamp removal and restoration of blood flow through the carotid sinus.\nCarotid cross-clamping increased mean +/- standard error of the mean SBP from 117 +/- 3 mm Hg before clamping to 125 +/- 3 mm Hg (P <.05) at 30 beats after clamping. The first rub test with the plaque in situ decreased SBP from 121 +/- 3 mm Hg to 117 +/- 3 mm Hg (P <.01) at 10 beats after the rub test, indicating a functioning baroreceptor reflex. The second rub test increased SBP from 126 +/- 3 mm Hg to 128 +/- 3 mm Hg (P <.05). SBP dropped (P <.01) when unclamping suggesting a selective alteration of the baroreflex sensitivity. The baroreflex sensitivity was significantly reduced 2 days postoperatively when compared to preoperative values (P <.05).\nThese findings suggest that the act of plaque removal could be associated with a partial disruption of baroreceptor mechanism in the carotid artery. This could affect type I baroreceptors.",

Participants underwent a fat-tolerance test and carotid artery plaque evaluation with use of high-resolution B-mode ultrasound and computerized image analysis. By comparison, female cases with carotid stenosis >or=50% had higher fasting and postprandial triglyceride levels than did controls; however, this difference was not observed between male cases and controls. Fasting and postprandial very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and intermediate density liprotein (IDL) cholesterol levels were elevated; low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level was unchanged, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level was reduced in both female and male cases vs controls. Fasting and postprandial triglyceride levels were elevated in women with echolucent plaques vs controls, but not in women with echo-rich plaques, or in men with echolucent or echo-rich plaques. Fasting and postprandial VLDL and IDL cholesterol levels were elevated, LDL cholesterol level was unchanged, and HDL cholesterol level was reduced in both female and male patients with echolucent plaques vs controls.\nFasting and postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (but not LDLs) are elevated in patients with carotid artery stenosis of >or=50% compared with controls, and particularly identify echolucent, rupture-prone carotid plaques. These observations are more pronounced in women than in men.",

    "abstract": "Catheterizations and endovascular procedures in which the femoral artery is cannulated are sometimes complicated by iatrogenic pseudoaneuryms. Surgical repair of pseudoaneurysms was the treatment of choice until 1991 when compression was used in those that were small. A less uncomfortable technique involving the ultrasound scan-guided injection of thrombin (UGTI) has been used more recently. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound scan-guided thrombin injection (UGTI) as a treatment of iatrogenic femoral pseudoaneurysms.\nFrom December 1998 to December 2000, 3734 femoral artery catheterizations were performed, and from those, 32 consecutive patients with 33 femoral pseudoaneurysms (0.88%) of less than 8 cm were prospectively enrolled for UGTI. With sterile technique, a 21-gauge or 22-gauge spinal needle was used to access the pseudoaneurysm and thrombin (100 to 6000 international units [IU]) was slowly injected until thrombosis occurred.\nThe initial success rate was 100%. Thirty-one cases (93.9%) remained successfully thrombosed with a single injection at day 30. Recurrence of two pseudoaneurysms (6.1%) was seen at day 1 and day 8. One patient had groin cellulitis develop, and the other had a bleed into the thigh after discharge; both were treated with open surgical repair. Fifteen patients underwent UGTI on an outpatient basis with 100% successful ablation. More than half of the patients were on an inpatient basis (53.1%). Hospital stay was 1 to 9 days, with 88.2% of the patients released on day 1 or 2. However, two patients had a prolonged stay: one from open repair (day 9) and the other from a gastrointestinal bleed (day 8). Pseudoaneurysms ranged from 1.7 to 7.5 cm and lasted 1 to 17 days before UGTI. Twenty-one of the patients (65.7%) continued undergoing anticoagulant therapy at the time of injection. Ten of the last 11 cases needed less than 800 IU, and nearly half of the pseudoaneurysms (49%) successfully thrombosed with less than 600 IU. No procedural complications or mortality were noted. No statistical significance was found between occurrence of the pseudoaneurysm and sheath size (with chi(2) test, P value =.05) or between the size of the pseudoaneurysm and successful thrombosis (with chi(2) test: degrees of freedom, 6 - 1 = 5; P value =.227426). A mean follow-up period of 11.8 months was documented (range, 71 to 24 months). Seven patients were lost to follow-up at less than 30 days.\nPercutaneous thrombin injection of iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms is an effective treatment. Not only is it minimally painful, but it can be done as an outpatient procedure and anticoagulation therapy does not hinder the success. Minimal thrombin seems necessary to successfully treat pseudoaneurysms that may further limit procedure-related complications.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy of a modification of the composite sequential femorocrural bypass graft that we adopted in 1985, a retrospective case-note study was undertaken. The grafts combined a prosthetic femoropopliteal section with a popliteal to crural section with autologous vein, linked via a common intermediate anastomosis sited on the above-knee popliteal artery.\nBetween 1985 and 2000, 68 grafts of this type were constructed in 65 patients with critical ischemia of the lower limb and insufficient autologous vein for construction of an all venous bypass. Reasons for insufficient long saphenous vein included previous lower limb bypass in 33 cases, phlebitis in 16 cases, venous hypoplasia in eight cases, and previous varicose vein surgery in seven cases. Distal anastomoses were carried out to the peroneal artery in 26 cases, the anterior tibial artery in 17 cases, the posterior tibial artery in 17 cases, and the pedal arteries in eight cases. Sources of vein included the long saphenous vein in 26 cases, the arm vein in 38 cases, and the short saphenous vein in two cases. In 22 limbs (32%), angiography had shown an occluded segment of above-knee popliteal artery, and in these cases, local popliteal disobliteration was performed to receive the composite anastomosis and to provide additional outflow.\nThe 2-year cumulative primary patency, secondary patency, and limb salvage rates were 68%, 73%, and 75%, respectively. Localized popliteal disobliteration did not compromise graft patency (P =.07, with log-rank test).\nIn the absence of sufficient autologous vein, patients needing bypass to crural arteries can be offered reconstruction with composite sequential grafting with satisfactory results. Furthermore, an occluded above-knee popliteal segment is not a contraindication for composite sequential bypass reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "As yet, there is no patient-assessed, condition-specific instrument for the assessment of health-related quality of life in intermittent claudication. We evaluated the intermittent claudication questionnaire (ICQ) for properties required of a measure of health outcome.\nInterviews with patients with intermittent claudication and vascular specialist opinion produced a pool of statements used to itemize a self-completed ICQ. This was piloted in 20 patients for practicality and then administered to 124 stable claudicants. Reliability was assessed through a retest in 63 (51%) patients at 14 days and analysis of Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to assess construct validity in comparisons between the ICQ and ankle brachial pressure index, treadmill-walking distances, the walking impairment questionnaire, the EuroQol, and the Short Form-36. Responsiveness of the ICQ to changes in health was assessed in 60 patients treated conservatively and 40 patients undergoing angioplasty. The standardized response mean was used to identify the most responsive instrument in the study. A 16-item ICQ with a test-retest intraclass correlation of 0.95 and Cronbach's alpha of.94 was produced. One hundred twenty-one (98%) patients completed the ICQ (mean time, 3.7 minutes). The ICQ correlated better with the EuroQol (r = 0.58) and 7 out of 8 subscales of the Short Form-36 (r = 0.33-0.68) compared with the walking impairment questionnaire. The ICQ demonstrated the largest standardized response mean in relation to health transition compared with the other instruments.\nThe patient-assessed ICQ is a practical, reliable, valid, and responsive measure of patient health-related quality of life in intermittent claudication.",

STUDY DESIGN, SETTINGS AND METHODS: Data on present medication, smoking status, and medical history of participants in two population-based aneurysm screening programs in the United Kingdom were collected by use of questionnaire. Aortic elasticity was measured by M-mode ultrasound scanning. A serum radioimmunoassay of the amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen was used to assess collagen turnover in one of the patient series.\nData from 438 cases with an AAA >29 mm and 5373 controls were analyzed. Calcium-channel blockers were independently associated with AAA. The odds ratio of having an AAA was 2.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-4.2) after adjusting for all relevant confounders. Other antihypertensive drugs showed no increased risk. No significant differences in growth rates were found in cases exposed to any of the main antihypertensive drugs. An increased collagen turnover was found in subjects receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: 4.26 mg/L (95% CI, 3.73-4.79) compared with 3.62 mg/L (95% CI, 3.49-3.76) for subjects not receiving ACE inhibitors. No differences in type III collagen turnover was found with use of any other antihypertensive drug. The mean aortic wall stiffness was greater for all subjects exposed to calcium-channel blockers, whether with AAA or not: 25.1 arbitrary units (95% CI, 20.0-30.2) vs 19.3 (95% CI, 18.1-20.4)(P =.002). By contrast, the mean stiffness for cases receiving ACE inhibitors was smaller than for those not receiving ACE inhibitors: 19.0 (95% CI, 13.9-24.0) vs 25.2 (95% CI, 23.0-27.4).\nCalcium-channel blockers were an independent risk factor for the presence of an AAA and were associated with an increased arterial aortic wall stiffness. ACE inhibitors were associated with decreased stiffness and greater collagen turnover. No significant effects on the growth rate of small aneurysms were detected.",

    "abstract": "In aortic dissection, visceral complications that result from aortic branch compromise have been described extensively, whereas intestinal ischemia not associated with the false lumen anatomy has rarely been discussed. The aim of this report is to identify clinical factors that may contribute to the development of this form of acute mesenteric ischemia, to profile the patients at greatest risk, and to review diagnostic and treatment methods that emerged from our experience.\nWith a computerized database, we identified 371 patients who underwent treatment in our institution with a diagnosis of aortic dissection between July 15, 1985, and January 10, 2001. Mesenteric ischemia was present in 73 patients (19%). In 36 patients (9%), bowel ischemia was not associated with a false lumen anatomy or an extension of the dissection process. From a general analysis of the determinants of mesenteric ischemia in aortic dissection, we investigated, with univariate and multivariate analysis, the specific characteristics of these patients with nonocclusive ischemia.

    "abstract": "This report describes the authors' initial experience with the Excluder thoracic endoprosthesis (W. L. Gore and Associates, Inc, Flagstaff, Ariz) and the thoracic Talent endoprosthesis (Medtronic AVE, Sunrise, Fla) and their safety and efficacy in the primary endovascular repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs). In addition, comparison with a historic nonrandomized cohort of patients that had undergone open repair of descending TAAs is reported.\nRepair of TAA (mean diameter, 68 +/- 22 mm) was attempted in 19 patients with the Excluder (n = 14) and the Talent (n = 5) endoprostheses between March 1999 and January 2000. This group was compared with a historic nonrandomized cohort of 10 patients that had undergone open repair of anatomically similar descending TAA (mean diameter, 74 +/- 22 mm) between January 1996 and January 1998. The mean age in the endovascular group was 70.6 +/- 5.3 years versus 70.1 +/- 4.5 years in the historic open group. All the procedures were performed in a standard operating room with angiographic capabilities. In the historic open group, each standard tube graft repair of descending TAA was performed by one of three staff surgeons.\nEndograft deployment was successful in 18 patients (95%). The procedure was aborted in one patient (Excluder) because of small iliac arteries and access difficulty. The average operative time was 155 +/- 62 minutes, with a mean blood loss of 325 +/- 353 mL (versus 256 +/- 102 minutes and 1205 +/- 1493 mL, respectively, in the open group). Eight patients needed the planned use of more than one component for enhanced sealing or additional length in the endovascular group. No type I endoleaks were identified on the intraoperative completion angiography. One perioperative mortality occurred in the endovascular group and the open group. In the endovascular group, other complications included retroperitoneal hematoma and external iliac artery dissection (n = 1), lymphocele (n = 1), and common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (n = 1). In the open group, other complications included ischemic colitis (n = 1), severe renal insufficiency (n = 2), wound infection (n = 1), and stroke (n = 1). In the endovascular group, the length of stay was 6.2 +/- 3.3 days (range, 1 to 13 days), with only nine patients needing intensive care, whereas in the open group, the length of stay was 16.3 +/- 6.7 days, with all patients needing intensive care. Endoleaks, graft migrations, or ruptures were not seen on the 1-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up computed tomographic scans in the endovascular group. On the average, aneurysm size decreased from 68 +/- 22 mm to 58 +/- 13 mm, to 51 +/- 14 mm, and to 49 +/- 12 mm at 1, 6, and 12 months after endovascular repair, respectively. No spinal cord ischemia was seen in either group.\nThe endoluminal repair was effective in exclusion of descending TAAs from the systemic circulation in this selected group of patients. In this short-term follow-up, compared with the nonrandomized historic cohort of open descending TAA repair, the endovascular group had significantly shorter operating times and hospital and intensive care unit stays and lower operative blood loss. Further follow-up and continued assessment of the long-term durability of these devices in elective and emergency circumstances are warranted.",

    "abstract": "To report our initial experience with endovascular stent-graft repair of complicated penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers as an alternative to surgery in patients with increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality.\nDuring a 2-year period, eight patients with complicated penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers of the descending thoracic aorta were treated with the Gore Excluder stent-graft. Patients (mean age, 70.6 years) presented with two to five comorbid conditions causing an increased risk for surgical repair. In addition to painful events, three patients presented with severe hemoptysis, one patient with shortness of breath, and one patient with dysphagia. All patients underwent emergency computed tomography, and diagnosis of contained rupture was confirmed in five patients. Computed tomographic findings included one to three penetrating ulcers per patient (n = 4), pseudoaneurysms (n = 5), additional intramural hematomas (n = 4), mediastinal bleeding (n = 2), and hematothoraces (n = 4). Through an iliac or femoral access site, a total of 11 stent-grafts were implanted under general (n = 5), epidural (n = 2), or spinal (n = 1) anesthesia.\nDeployment of stent-grafts was successful in all patients, and all sites of hemorrhage were sealed. The intramural hematoma resolved completely in three cases, and two pseudoaneurysms decreased in size. Intentional occlusion of the origin of left subclavian artery with the stent-graft in one patient was tolerated without left arm or cerebral symptoms. One patient experienced permanent paraplegia immediately after endovascular repair. There were no deaths during the hospital stay (range, 7-35 days; mean, 14.5 days).

The appropriate indications and the efficacy of surgical thrombectomy, thrombolysis, and systemic anticoagulation remain controversial.\nThis study, set in an academic medical center, was a retrospective review of five patients with AMT in the absence of aortic disease who underwent treatment between 1997 and 2001. The main outcome measures were morbidity, mortality, and treatment outcome.\nThree patients were women, and ages ranged from 40 to 77 years. On admission, all patients had symptoms related to thrombus embolization (extremity pain or abdominal pain). Two patients had a history of venous thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis). Four patients had biochemical evidence of hypercoaguability, and the fifth had malignant disease. Coagulation disorders included increased homocysteine (n = 2) and factor VIII (n = 1), antithrombin III (n = 1) and protein C deficiency (n = 1), and familial dysfibrinogenemia (n = 1). AMT were located in the infrarenal (n = 1), suprarenal (n = 3), and descending thoracic (n = 1) aorta. One patient needed exploratory laparotomy and one needed lower extremity vascular procedures for visceral and limb-threatening ischemia, respectively. Treatment with systemic anticoagulation therapy resulted in complete resolution on follow-up computed tomographic scan or angiogram of the AMT at a median of 60 days.\nMost patients in whom AMT develops in the absence of underlying aortic disease have underlying coagulation disorders. Anticoagulation therapy alone allows resolution of AMT, with surgical intervention reserved for management of end organ ischemia from thrombus embolization.",

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing treatment for cancer have a high risk and prevalence of venous thrombosis and frequent contraindications to anticoagulation therapy that lead to placement of caval filters. We questioned whether the increasing frequency of this intervention has clinical benefit.\nBetween 1993 and 2000, 116 patients undergoing active treatment for malignant disease underwent filter placement at our institution. Outcome was retrospectively assessed with regard to procedural complications, recurrent thrombotic events, and patient survival.\nPrimary tumors were gastrointestinal (n = 25), lung (n = 24), breast (n = 14), gynecologic (n = 14), prostate (n = 12), hematologic (n = 8), urologic (n = 4) or other (n = 15). Indications for filter were contraindication to anticoagulation therapy for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE; bleeding, n = 33; surgery, n = 29), recurrent or propagating DVT or recurrent PE during anticoagulation therapy (n = 17), right heart failure (n = 15), intracerebral malignancy (n = 7), and other indications (n = 18). Procedural complications were five localized hematomas, none necessitating surgery. Two patients had progressive DVT and three had clinical recurrent PE after filter placement.

    "abstract": "Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair is a durable procedure performed with reasonable perioperative mortality and morbidity in patients with atherosclerotic aortic disease. However, the long-term outcome and durability of TAAA repair performed in patients with a connective tissue disorder (CTD) is not well known.\nThe records of 257 patients who underwent TAAA repair at the Johns Hopkins Hospital between January 1992 and December 2001 were reviewed. Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier analysis, and subgroups were compared with the log-rank test. Multivariable analysis was performed with the Cox proportional hazards model and logistic regression.\nPatients with CTD (n = 31) were seen earlier (mean age, 48.6 +/- 2.9 years) than patients without CTD (mean age, 69.1 +/- 0.6 years; P <.0001, Mann-Whitney U test) and had a greater incidence rate of aortic dissection (52% versus 19%; P <.0001, chi(2) test) and extent I or II aneurysm (77% versus 64%; P =.04). The perioperative (30-day) mortality rate was 6.5% in patients with CTD, which was similar to the rest of the cohort (P =.39, Fisher exact test). The incidence rate of paraparesis/paraplegia was 12.9%/6.5% in patients with CTD, and CTD was the only factor predictive of paraparesis (P =.03; odds ratio, 9.3; logistic regression). The cumulative survival rate among the entire cohort was 53.4% +/- 4.4% at 5 years (Kaplan-Meier), and no difference was seen among patients with or without CTD (P =.16, log-rank test) or among different Crawford extents (P =.29). Of the two late (>6 months) deaths in patients with CTD, none were from aortic rupture or dissection, compared with two of 31 late deaths in patients without CTD. Multivariable analysis confirmed that postoperative renal failure (P =.03) predicted mortality but neither CTD (P =.93), nor Crawford extent (P =.21, Cox regression) predicted mortality. Among survivors, no mean difference was found in largest aortic diameter on follow-up imaging in patients with or without CTD (4.7 +/- 0.3 cm versus 4.4 +/- 0.3 cm; P =.47, Mann-Whitney U test). The cumulative graft patency rate, representing long-term graft stability and with death, rupture, dissection, or recurrent aneurysm as endpoints, was 47.5% +/- 4.6% at 5 years (Kaplan-Meier) and was similar in patients with or without CTD (P =.10, log-rank test).\nTAAA repair appears to be a durable operation, with a reasonable 5-year patient survival rate and a low risk of postoperative paraplegia or additional aortic events. Patients with CTD can expect their outcome, including long-term survival and aortic stability, to be similar to patients without CTD.",

    "abstract": "Graft limb occlusion may complicate endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The precise etiologic factors that contribute to the development of these graft limb thromboses have not been defined. We evaluated our experience with bifurcated aortic endografts to determine factors that may predict subsequent limb thrombosis. The management of the thrombosed limbs and the results after treatment were also investigated.\nDuring a 4-year period, 351 patients with aortic aneurysms underwent treatment with bifurcated endografts (702 graft limbs at risk). These 351 bifurcated devices included AneuRx (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn; n = 35), Ancure (Guidant, Menlo Park, Calif; n = 8), Gore (W.L. Gore & Associates, Sunnyvale, Calif; n = 25), Talent (World Medical, Sunrise, Fla; n = 255), Teramed (Teramed, Minneapolis, Minn; n = 10), and Vanguard (Boston Scientific Vascular, Natick, Mass; n = 18). Details regarding the type of device, mechanism of deployment, and aortoiliac artery anatomy were collected prospectively and analyzed. Graft limbs were analyzed for diameter, use of additional endograft iliac extensions, deployment in the external iliac artery, and endograft to vessel oversizing. Follow-up included physical examination, duplex ultrasonography, and spiral computed tomographic scans at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months and annually thereafter. The follow-up period ranged from 2 to 54 months, with a mean follow-up period of 20 months.\nTwenty-six of 702 limbs (3.7%) had an occlusion develop. The risk of limb thrombosis was associated with a smaller limb diameter. Mean graft limb diameter was 14 mm in the occluded population, and patent limbs had a mean diameter of 16 mm. Thrombosis occurred in 16 of 291 limbs (5.5%) that were 14 mm or less and in 10 of 411 limbs (2.4%) that were greater than 14 mm (P =.03). Extension of a graft to the external iliac artery was performed in 96 of the 702 limbs. Eight of these 96 limbs (8.3%) had thrombosis develop as compared with 18 of 606 (3.0%) that extended to the common iliac artery (P =.01). No significant association was present between limb thrombosis and the contralateral or ipsilateral side of a device, the configuration of the iliac graft limb end (closed web, open web, or bare spring), or the degree of iliac graft limb oversizing. AneuRx, Ancure, Vanguard, and Talent grafts each sustained limb occlusions, with no occlusions seen among the Gore and Teramed devices.

    "abstract": "The endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms has become increasingly common during the past decade. Despite aggressive attempts to treat endoleak and graft failure with endovascular salvage procedures, some grafts necessitate surgical removal. We reviewed our experience with late endograft explantation in an effort to identify technical maneuvers critical for success.\nOf 110 patients treated with aortic abdominal endografts at the University of Rochester Medical Center between August 1997 and June 2001, five (4.5%) needed late graft removal. Medical records, radiographic files, and case report forms were retrospectively reviewed.\nOne Talent (Medtronic AVE, Santa Rosa, Calif) and four Vanguard (Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass) grafts were removed at a mean of 32.7 months (range, 18 to 44 months) after implantation. One patient underwent conversion for rupture, three for endoleaks (one each with types I, II, and III), and one for stent separation from the graft material without endoleak or aneurysm expansion. Three cases were approached via the midline, one through a bilateral subcostal incision, and one through a retroperitoneal incision. Supraceliac aortic control was used in all patients. Removal of two of the Vanguard grafts necessitated extension of the aortotomy above the level of the renal orifices. One perioperative death occurred. The mean operative blood loss was 4700 mL (range, 1850 to 9000 mL), and length of stay was 19.8 days (range, 7 to 42 days).\nThe morbidity and mortality rates associated with late removal of endografts are significant. Removal of Vanguard devices can necessitate extension of the aortotomy above the renal arteries. We believe that control of the aorta well above the proximal fixation site is the key to removal and that continuous aortic exposure via retroperitoneal exposure is the best option in this situation.",

    "abstract": "Total occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery has often been considered to be a predictor of poor outcome after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) of ipsilateral carotid stenosis. Data from both the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study have suggested this to be true. However, each of these trials had relatively few patients with contralateral occlusion in the surgical arms of the studies. Recently, advocates of carotid angioplasty and stenting have suggested that this technique may be preferable in patients with a contralateral occlusion because of the perceived poor outcome with surgery. The purpose of this study was to review a large series of CEAs performed in patients with contralateral occlusion to see whether results differed from patients with patent contralateral arteries and to determine whether the presence of preoperative symptoms was an important factor in outcome in these cases.\nA review was conducted of a prospectively compiled database of all primary CEAs performed at our institution from 1985 to 1999. Surgery was performed on 2420 patients, of whom 338 (14.0%) had contralateral total occlusion.\nPatients with contralateral total occlusion were more likely to be symptomatic (65.7% versus 60.1%; P =.1), male (70.9% versus 58%; P <.001), and hypertensive (63.9% versus 58.4%; P =.07) with a positive smoking history (42.6% versus 31.4%; P <.001) than patients with patent contralateral carotid artery. No significant difference was seen in the rates of perioperative neurologic events between patients with contralateral occlusion (3.0%) and those without (2.1%; P =.34). Among the total of 913 asymptomatic patients, of whom 115 had contralateral occlusion, no difference was seen in the rate of perioperative neurologic events (1.8% for contralateral occlusion cases; 1.9% for cases without contralateral occlusion). Among the total of 1507 symptomatic patients, of whom 223 had contralateral occlusion, no significant difference was seen in the rate of perioperative neurologic events (3.7% for contralateral occlusion cases; 2.2% for cases without contralateral occlusion; P =.2).\nThe presence of contralateral occlusion does not appear to increase the perioperative risk of CEA. Although the risk of CEA in symptomatic patients with contralateral occlusion may be slightly increased, this must be weighed against the risk with medical treatment alone. CEA can be performed safely in patients with contralateral occlusion, which should not necessarily be considered a high-risk condition for surgery in favor of angioplasty and stenting.",

Of the original number identified, 137 carotid endarterectomies (CEs) were performed in 123 patients (OP group) and 59 carotid arteries in 57 patients were managed nonoperatively (NOM group.) The NOM group was further subdivided into those patients who refused care (NOM-R group; n = 21; 36.8%) versus those who were not offered CE on the basis of comorbid conditions (NOM-C group; n = 36; 63.2%). Clinical follow-up was obtained to determine rates of neurologic events, patient survival, and progression to occlusion.\nDuring the follow-up period, a total of 13 ipsilateral neurologic events occurred: two amaurosis fugax (15.4%), two transient ischemic attacks (15.4%), and nine strokes (69.2%). The NOM-R group had a significantly lower ipsilateral neurologic event-free rate when compared with the OP group at both 18 months (81% +/- 9.8% versus 96% +/- 1.8%; P <.02) and 2 years (81% +/- 10.6% versus 95% +/- 2.1%; P <.04.)

All had a positive blood or tissue culture; 89% were febrile, 89% had leukocytosis, and 32% were hemodynamically unstable. The most common responsible pathogens were Salmonella organisms (74%) followed by Streptococcus species (11%). Nine of 10 infrarenal infections were caused by Salmonella organisms. Both infrarenal and suprarenal infections were treated with wide d\u00e9bridement of infected aorta, in situ prosthetic graft or patch repair, and prolonged intravenous antibiotics. Hospital survival rate was 95%: 100% for infrarenal and 89% for suprarenal infections. There was no perioperative intestinal ischemia or perioperative limb loss. Acute renal failure occurred in two patients with suprarenal infection. Late deaths have occurred in three patients with one early graft infection (5%) resulting in the only one in-hospital death at 4 months. Sixteen patients remain alive at mean follow-up of 17.8 months (range, 4-47 months). There have been no late aortic or graft infections. During the same period, there were five unoperated patients, four of whom died of shock during hospitalization.\nInfected aortic aneurysm is common in Taiwan, and Salmonella species were the most common responsible microorganisms. With surgical intervention and prolonged intravenous antibiotics, in situ graft replacement provided a good outcome. The incidence of prosthetic graft infection was low, even in patients with infections due to Salmonella species and with in situ graft replacement.",

All had a positive blood or tissue culture; 89% were febrile, 89% had leukocytosis, and 32% were hemodynamically unstable. The most common responsible pathogens were Salmonella organisms (74%) followed by Streptococcus species (11%). Nine of 10 infrarenal infections were caused by Salmonella organisms. Both infrarenal and suprarenal infections were treated with wide d\u00e9bridement of infected aorta, in situ prosthetic graft or patch repair, and prolonged intravenous antibiotics. Hospital survival rate was 95%: 100% for infrarenal and 89% for suprarenal infections. There was no perioperative intestinal ischemia or perioperative limb loss. Acute renal failure occurred in two patients with suprarenal infection. Late deaths have occurred in three patients with one early graft infection (5%) resulting in the only one in-hospital death at 4 months. Sixteen patients remain alive at mean follow-up of 17.8 months (range, 4-47 months). There have been no late aortic or graft infections. During the same period, there were five unoperated patients, four of whom died of shock during hospitalization.",

    "abstract": "Methods used for evaluation of cardiac risk before noncardiac surgery vary widely. We evaluated the effect over time on practice and resource utilization of implementing the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines on Preoperative Risk Assessment.\nWe compared 102 historical control patients who underwent elective abdominal aortic surgery (from January 1993 to December 1994) with 94 consecutive patients after guideline implementation (from July 1995 to December 1996) and 104 patients in a late after guideline implementation (from July 1, 1997, to September 30, 1998). Resource use (testing, revascularization, and costs) and outcomes (perioperative death and myocardial infarction) were examined. Patients with and without clinical markers of risk for perioperative cardiac complications were compared.\nThe use of preoperative stress testing (88% to 47%; P <.00001), cardiac catheterization (24% to 11%; P <.05), and coronary revascularization (25% to 2%; P <.00001) decreased between control and postguideline groups, respectively. These changes persisted in the late postguideline group. Mean preoperative evaluation costs also fell ($1087 versus $171; P <.0001). Outcomes of death (4% versus 3% versus 2%) and myocardial infarction (7% versus 3% versus 5%) were not significantly different between control, postguideline, and late postguideline groups, respectively. Stress test rates were similar for patients at low risk versus high risk in the historical control group (84% versus 91%; P =.29) but lower for patients at low risk after guideline implementation (31% versus 61%; P =.003).\nImplementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cardiac risk assessment guidelines appropriately reduced resource use and costs in patients who underwent elective aortic surgery without affecting outcomes. This effect was sustained 2 years after guideline implementation.",

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether patients with asymptomatic stenosis of the ICA have a better collateral ability of the circle of Willis when compared with patients with symptomatic ICA stenosis.\nMagnetic resonance angiography consisting of the circle of Willis was performed in 19 patients with severe asymptomatic ICA stenosis and in 21 patients with severe symptomatic ICA stenosis prior to carotid endarterectomy and in 53 control subjects. Between group comparisons were made for function (directional flow) and anatomy (diameter).\nIn patients with asymptomatic ICA stenosis, the prevalence of collateral flow via the anterior communicating artery was significantly increased (37%, 7 of 19) compared with symptomatic patients (10%, 2 of 21) and control subjects (0%; P <.001). Patients with asymptomatic ICA stenosis demonstrated the largest mean diameter of the anterior communicating artery (1.33 +/- 0.18 mm) compared with patients with symptomatic ICA stenosis (1.22 +/- 0.18 mm) and control subjects (1.06 +/- 0.10 mm, P <.05). No differences in collateral flow pattern or diameter were found for the posterior communicating artery between the groups.\nThe present cross-sectional study demonstrates the importance of an adequate hemodynamic compensation via the circle of Willis in patients with ICA stenosis. Whether differences in collateral compensation can be used to select patients for CEA has yet to be determined.",

    "abstract": "Decreased federal monies for graduate medical education, increased clinical training demands, and a decreased pool of general surgery trainees applying to vascular surgery fellowships have brought into question the relevance of the fellowship research experience. This study sought to describe the recent laboratory experience of the fellows, the value of this experience to program directors (PDs) and the trainees, and what factors related to this experience contributed to the trainee entering an academic career versus a private practice career.\nA survey regarding the relevance of research experience during fellowship training was mailed in 2001 to all Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-approved vascular surgery fellowship PDs and vascular surgery fellows (VSFs) from 1988 to 2000 applying for the American Board of Surgery Certificate of Added Qualification in General Vascular Surgery.\nSurvey responses were received from 89% of the PDs (74/83) and 69% of the VSFs (259/378). Among the PDs, 70% had completed an approved fellowship, and current bench research was performed by 46%. The PDs afforded protected research time to 69% of the VSFs (with a mean duration of 12 months). This research was in the basic science laboratory 34% of the time. Only 42% of the PDs considered basic laboratory research to be an important part of the fellowship, whereas 99% believed that clinical research was important. Among the PDs, 42% believed that more practice-oriented fellowships with no basic research were needed, whereas 35% believed that basic research should remain an integral component of the fellowship. VSF basic science productivity was significantly greater from those programs that offered protected research time as compared with those that did not (mean basic science paper published, 1.7 +/- 0.1 versus 0.3 +/- 0.6 per VSF; P <.001). At the time of the survey, 99 VSFs had entered academic careers and 136 were in private practice. Basic science research had been undertaken by 56% of the VSFs during medical school and by 53% during general surgery residency. Research during the fellowship was performed by 65% of the VSFs. This experience was considered helpful in choosing an academic or private practice career by 44% of the VSFs. A greater proportion of academic surgeons had research experience as VSFs when compared with VSFs who became private practitioners (71% versus 57%; P <.05). VSFs who entered academic careers had a more productive publication record in fellowship than did those who chose private practice (mean paper, 2.4 versus 1.5; P <.05). Overall, 78% of the VSFs believed that their research experience was maturing beyond the technical skills learned.\nThis report provides a benchmark of the vascular surgery fellowship research experience. Most VSFs considered the research experience as it now exists to be worthwhile, and less than half of the PDs believed that it should remain as it is. Research experience in fellowship seemed more influential than that in medical school or general surgical residency in promoting an academic career.",

In two patients with disabling intermittent claudication on the basis of severe aortoiliac occlusive disease, laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass grafting was performed with a proximal end-to-side anastomosis constructed with robotic arms that had been mounted on the operating table and were controlled from a separate console. No complications occurred. Operating times were 290 and 260 minutes, and aortic anastomosis times were 48 and 37 minutes, respectively. Blood loss was less than 200 mL in both cases. A normal diet was resumed on the second postoperative day, and the patients were discharged home on postoperative days 4 and 6. To our knowledge, this is the first report on robot-assisted laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass in the world literature.",

    "abstract": "We report an unusual case of a patient with diminished cardiac output caused by systemic venous occlusions of unclear etiology with a history of idiopathic fibrosing mediastinitis and retroperitoneal fibrosis. On thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic venograms, the patient was previously known to have superior vena caval and infrarenal inferior vena caval occlusions. Subsequent studies revealed retrograde flow through the azygous and hemiazygous veins and numerous caval-portal anastomoses providing venous return from the upper and lower extremities. After an extensive hypercoagulable state work-up, no abnormalities were found. To relieve the symptoms, the patient underwent an elective right thoracotomy with azygous vein to right atrial bypass graft. The patient has had complete amelioration of the disabling symptoms and participates in many activities that he could not tolerate previously. Because this condition and procedure are unreported, we present a novel surgical treatment option to palliate symptoms caused by concurrent superior and inferior caval obstructions by improving venous return to the heart.",

    "abstract": "We describe the case of a 40-year-old man with an acquired renal arteriovenous fistula (AVF) treated with endovascular placement of a homemade polytetrafluoroethylene covered Palmaz stent (Johnson & Johnson, Warren, NJ). The patient was seen with a abdominal bruit 5 years after exploratory laparotomy for multiple knife stab wounds. An abdominal computed tomographic scan showed an atrophic right kidney and enlarged right renal vein and inferior vena cava. Arteriography confirmed a 5-mm to 7-mm AVF between the right renal artery and vein. In November 1999, the patient was taken to the operating room where a Palmaz 308 polytetrafluoroethylene covered stent was placed within the renal artery at the site of the fistula. Exclusion of the fistula was confirmed with arteriogram. To our knowledge, this is one of the earliest reports and the longest follow-up of the endovascular placement of a covered stent for treatment of an acquired renal AVF. Continued application of covered stent treatment for renal AVFs should prove less expensive with improved renal preservation and, with prefabricated stent grafts, prove less cumbersome and time consuming than coil embolization.",

Multiple atheroemboli were found with the histopathologic examination of the excised prepuce. Atheroembolization is a rare complication of therapeutic IIA occlusion, and the ischemic sequels can be severe because of the coincidence of atheroembolization and occlusion of the main supplying artery.",

Vein grafts are uniquely amenable to intraoperative genetic modification because of the ability to manipulate the tissue ex vivo with controlled conditions. Although the pathophysiology of vein graft failure is incompletely understood, numerous relevant molecular targets have been elucidated. Interventions designed to influence cell proliferation, thrombosis, inflammation, and matrix remodeling at the genetic level have been described, and many have been tested in animal models. Both gene delivery and gene blockade strategies have been investigated, with the latter now reaching the stage of advanced clinical trials. This review describes the basic and translational science of genetic interventions for vein graft disease and the current state of application in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Although intravascular stents have received widespread application, significant limitations remain. In stent restenosis, the most pervasive problem affecting stents, is related in part to technical aspects of the device. Design features of the stent that influence outcome have been identified and optimized for improved performance. The influence of stent materials on critical aspects of healing, such as thrombotic, inflammatory, and hyperplastic responses, are less well understood. For this reason, significant progress in this area is lacking. Current stents have significant contamination with industrial impurities on the surface and in the bulk. This fact adds to the difficulties in interpreting the biologic reaction of the host to the device. Better understanding of the basic biologic interactions is the path to significant improvement.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation and elastinolysis are observed in the media of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) where vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) density is decreased. In contrast, elastin and VSMCs are preserved in the noninflammatory media of stenotic atherosclerotic lesions. We have tested the hypothesis that VSMCs exert a protective effect against inflammation and proteolysis in a model of AAA in rats, in which medial elastin degradation is driven by inflammation and matrix metalloproteinases.\nDecellularized guinea pig aortas (xenografts) were implanted orthotopically into Fischer-344 rats and seeded with a suspension of rat VSMCs syngeneic to the rat recipient, or were infused with culture medium as a control. Diameter and elastin in the media were quantified 8 weeks after implantation. Inflammation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP) expression were analyzed 1 and 2 weeks after implantation.\nVSMC addition prevented AAA formation (mean +/- standard deviation diameter increase: 198.2% +/- 106.6% vs 35.3% +/- 17.8%, P =.009), elastin degradation, and decreased infiltration by monocyte-macrophages. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, zymography and reverse zymography for MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and TIMP-3 demonstrated a shift of the proteolytic-antiproteolytic balance upon addition of VSMCs. Transcriptional changes were observed in the adventitia, although seeded VSMCs remained located in the intima.\nVSMCs exert a paracrine effect on the adventitia that participate in artery wall homeostasis against inflammation and proteolysis. Failure of this protective mechanism results in AAA formation. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying VSMC protective effect may represent a new approach in the treatment of aneurysm and plaque rupture.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Chlamydia pneumoniae (live, antigens, or polysaccharide) cause abdominal aortic aneurysm in a susceptible animal host with appropriate drug reversal.\nAt laparotomy, preparations of C pneumoniae (live, formalin-inactivated, and heat-inactivated) in calcium chloride were applied to the adventitial surface of the abdominal aorta of rabbits fed a cholesterol-enriched diet. Aortic diameter was measured with ultrasonography. After 3 weeks, immunohistochemistry was used to detect aortic C pneumoniae and macrophages. Presence of C pneumoniae DNA also was assessed.\nAt high doses (5 x 10(7) organisms) periaortic application of both live and formalin-inactivated preparations resulted in doubling of aortic diameter after 3 weeks, from 2.0 +/- 0.5 mm to 4.3 +/- 1.3 mm (P <.02). C pneumoniae DNA and antigens, together with a heavy macrophage infiltrate, were detected in the dilated aorta. In contrast, periaortic application of heat-inactivated preparations resulted in minimal macrophage influx and aortic dilatation. Treatment of rabbits with azithromycin or carprofen for 10 days after laparotomy abolished the effects of formalin-inactivated C pneumoniae on aortic dilatation. Azithromycin reduced the number of macrophages in the aortic wall more effectively than carprofen.\nBecause membrane antigenicity is retained in formalin-inactivated but not heat-inactivated organisms, in this experimental model, chlamydial membrane antigens (rather than live organisms) appear to cause the aneurysmal dilatation and associated macrophage recruitment. Azithromycin is likely to reverse these effects with an antiinflammatory mechanism.",

In addition, comparison of lipid levels after surgery was made with 287 healthy and 283 ischemic heart disease controls from The Copenhagen City Heart Study.\nTotal, low density lipoprotein, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were found to be significantly lower before surgery than 3 months after surgery (P <.001). In contrast, C-reactive protein was higher before surgery and decreased after 3 months (P <.0001). An inverse linear correlation was found between total cholesterol/low density lipoprotein cholesterol and C-reactive protein (P <.001 and P <.04, respectively). Comparison with controls showed that cholesterol levels 3 months after surgery were significantly lower (P <.009).\nSerum cholesterol levels are not reliable in the preoperative period and should therefore be measured at least 3 months after surgery when they seem to approach a more representative level.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the safety of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) within 6 weeks after a nondisabling carotid-related ischemic stroke. Endpoints were the perioperative stroke or mortality rate and the incidence rate of cerebral bleedings.\nThis prospective observational multicenter trial was performed in community and university centers. One hundred sixty-four hospitalized patients with nondisabling carotid-related ischemic stroke were included. The patients were identified clinically with the modified Rankin scale (initial neurologic deficit grade >/= 2, n = 160). Four patients with evidence of ischemic territorial infarction on cerebral computed tomographic (CT) scan but no persisting functional deficit were also included. CEA was performed within 6 weeks after stroke. Neurologic examinations were performed initially, before surgery, 3 days after surgery, and 6 weeks after CEA. Worsening of more than 1 grade on the Rankin scale was considered as a new stroke or stroke extension. Unenhanced CT scans of the brain were performed before and after surgery. CT scans were evaluated blind to clinical patient data. Statistical analysis included univariate and multivariate analysis.\nThe combined stroke or mortality rate within 30 days after CEA was 6.7%. Ten patients had a new ipsilateral stroke or stroke extension, and one patient died after surgery of a myocardial infarction. One patient (0.6%) had parenchymatous cerebral bleeding, and in 10 patients, hemorrhagic transformation within the preexisting ischemic infarction was detected but no infarct extension was observed. In the multivariate analysis, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) grades III and IV and decreasing age were significant predictors for an increased perioperative risk. Patients with a higher risk profile (ASA classification grades III and IV) had a high perioperative risk when CEA was performed within the first 3 weeks (14.6% versus 4.8% beyond 3 weeks). Patients without severe concomitant diseases (ASA grades I/II) had a low perioperative risk of 3.4% if CEA was performed within the first 3 weeks.\nEarly CEA within 6 weeks after a carotid-related ischemic stroke can be performed with a perioperative stroke or mortality rate comparable with the results reported in the European Carotid Surgery Trial and the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. The risk of parenchymatous bleeding is low. ASA grades III and IV and decreasing age were predictive of an increased perioperative risk, especially if CEA was performed within the first 3 weeks. Patients at low risk can undergo operation safely within the first 3 weeks. Individual patient selection in an interdisciplinary approach between neurologists, anesthesiologists, and vascular surgeons remains mandatory in these patients.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was determination of the expansion rates relative to the size of the common iliac artery (CIA) after elective placement of a straight aortic tube graft for an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nBetween January 1993 and December 1997, 74 men (mean age, 69 years) with AAA underwent surgical repair with a straight tube graft. All patients underwent preoperative and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans. The mean follow-up period was 68.3 months. The preoperative CT scan revealed a dilatation of at least one of the two CIAs in 32 patients (43.2%; group A). Within this group, the CIA was ectatic (12 mm < diameter < 18 mm) in 13 patients (subgroup A1) and aneurysmal (diameter >/=18 mm) in 19 patients (subgroup A2). The diameters of both CIAs were normal (diameter </=12 mm) in the other 42 patients (56.8%; group B).\nTwo patients (2.7%) in group A2 needed reoperation because of expansion of the diameter of the CIA; the preoperative diameter of the CIA in both patients was 30 mm. The diameters of the CIA aneurysms in the 17 other patients in subgroup A2 were smaller than 30 mm on the preoperative CT scan. After aortic surgery, the sizes of these aneurysms remained stable the first 5 years and reached a diameter of 30 mm on the CT scans obtained 7 to 8 years after surgery. Overall, 10 of the 74 patients (13.5%) had a CIA aneurysm develop that was smaller than 30 mm in diameter (mean diameter, 19.2 mm) 7 to 8 years after aortic surgery. The presence of a celiac aorta dilatation greater than or equal to 25 mm was the only statistically significant factor predictive of postoperative expansion of a CIA dilatation (P =.03).\nStraight aortoaortic tube grafts are indicated for CIAs with diameters smaller than 18 mm. Aorta biiliac bifurcated grafts are justified when the CIA diameter is between 18 and 30 mm, when the patient's life expectancy is longer than 8 years, or when the diameter of the celiac aorta is greater than or equal to 25 mm. A CIA aneurysm greater than or equal to 30 mm should be repaired during the same operative session as the AAA with placement of an aorta biiliac bifurcated graft.",

The diameters of the CIA aneurysms in the 17 other patients in subgroup A2 were smaller than 30 mm on the preoperative CT scan. After aortic surgery, the sizes of these aneurysms remained stable the first 5 years and reached a diameter of 30 mm on the CT scans obtained 7 to 8 years after surgery. Overall, 10 of the 74 patients (13.5%) had a CIA aneurysm develop that was smaller than 30 mm in diameter (mean diameter, 19.2 mm) 7 to 8 years after aortic surgery. The presence of a celiac aorta dilatation greater than or equal to 25 mm was the only statistically significant factor predictive of postoperative expansion of a CIA dilatation (P =.03).",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine intraoperative hemodynamic parameters that predict early failure of infragenicular vein grafts with intraoperative completion duplex ultrasound scan.\nWe reviewed the results of intraoperative duplex scans that were selectively performed after completion of 45 tibial/pedal vein bypass grafts at high risk for failure. Bypass was performed for rest pain (39%) or tissue loss (61%), and 60% of the cases were disadvantaged because of compromised vein quality or poor arterial outflow. A 10-MHz low-profile transducer was used to scan the entire graft at bypass completion. All grafts were determined to be technically adequate (absence of retained valves, arteriovenous fistulas, or localized velocity increases and the presence of bypass-dependent distal pulses). Peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end diastolic velocity (EDV) were also measured at each anastomosis, in the outflow artery and in the proximal and distal portions of each graft. Resistive indices (RI) were calculated at each measurement point (PSV-EDV/PSV). Statistical analysis was performed with unpaired t test, chi(2) test, and multivariate analyses.\nTwenty infragenicular vein bypass grafts (44%) thrombosed within 12 months. Intraoperative hemodynamic parameters were significantly different between grafts that remained patent or thrombosed. EDV was lower (5 +/- 1 cm/s versus 13 +/- 3 cm/s; P =.02) and RI was higher (0.90 versus 0.81; P <.01) in the proximal portions of grafts that thrombosed within 12 months. Distal EDV was also lower (6 +/- 1 cm/s versus 15 +/- 2 cm/s; P <.01) and distal RI was higher (0.89 versus 0.78; P <.01) in grafts that thrombosed. With multivariate analysis, only low distal EDV was predictive of early graft failure (P <.05). Distal bypass EDV of less than 8 cm/s predicated early graft thrombosis with 76% sensitivity and 75% specificity (positive predictive value, 71%; negative predictive value, 78%). Absence of diastolic flow (EDV of 0 cm/s) predicted early graft failure with 100% specificity and 100% positive predictive value.\nIn this initial experience, low EDV measured with intraoperative duplex scan was associated with early thrombosis of tibial level vein grafts. When such values are observed, measures should be taken to improve graft hemodynamic parameters. Prospective study of infragenicular vein bypass grafts may better define hemodynamic parameters predictive of early graft thrombosis.",

We herein present the largest series to date of a 10-year single-institution experience with LE bypass in patients with dialysis dependence.\nWith prospectively entered data from a university teaching hospital's vascular registry, we reviewed the records of all patients with dialysis dependence who underwent LE arterial bypass between January 1, 1990, and May 31, 1999.\nA total of 146 consecutive patients (177 limbs) underwent infrainguinal revascularization, of whom nearly all (92%) had diabetes and tissue loss (91%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 3% (five patients). The rates for perioperative congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and wound infection were 2%, 3%, 5%, and 10%, respectively. The actuarial graft primary and secondary patency rates at 1 and 3 years were 84% and 85%, and 64% and 68%, respectively. The limb salvage rates were 80% and 80% at 1 and 3 years. The 1-year and 3-year cumulative survival rates were 60% and 18%, respectively. At 5 years, survival was poor with only 5% of the entire cohort of 146 patients still alive. Multivariate logistic regression analysis at 6 months identified age (odds ratio, 0.96, 0.91) and number of years on dialysis (odds ratio, 0.79, 0.74) as significant (P <.05) negative predictors of both limb salvage and survival, respectively.\nInfrainguinal arterial reconstruction can be performed on patients with dialysis dependence with acceptable rates of limb salvage given the high incidence rate of perioperative complications and poor longevity of this patient group. Advanced age and number of years on dialysis seem to correlate with poorer outcome.",

    "abstract": "External pneumatic compression devices (EPC) prevent deep venous thrombosis (DVT) by reducing lower extremity venous stasis. Early studies suggested they also enhance fibrinolytic activity; however, in a recent study, EPC had no effect on systemic fibrinolysis in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. The hypothesis of this study was that EPCs enhance regional fibrinolysis in these subjects.\nForty-five patients (44 male, one female; mean age, 67 years) undergoing major abdominal surgery (35 bowel procedures, 10 aortic reconstructions) were prospectively randomized to one of three groups for DVT prophylaxis: subcutaneous heparin injections (HEP), thigh-length sequential EPC devices (EPC), or both (HEP+EPC). Prophylaxis was begun immediately before surgical incision and continued until postoperative day 5 or patient discharge. Venous blood samples were collected from the common femoral vein for measurement of regional fibrinolysis after induction of anesthesia but before initiation of prophylaxis, and on postoperative days 1, 3, and 5. A baseline sample was collected the day before surgery. Fibrinolysis was quantified with measurement of the activities of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; the activator of fibrinolysis) and its inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) with amidolytic technique.\ntPA activity in all groups was normal at baseline; baseline PAI-1 activity was elevated. Within each prophylaxis group, no significant changes occurred in either tPA or PAI-1 activities after induction of anesthesia or after surgery compared with before surgery (P >.05, analysis of variance with repeated measures). No changes occurred between postoperative samples and after anesthesia within each group. No significant enhancement of fibrinolysis, manifested as either increased tPA activity or decreased PAI-1 activity, occurred in either EPC group compared with the HEP group at any time point (P >.05, analysis of variance with repeated measures). No differences were noted when surgery was performed for malignant disease versus nonmalignant disease.\nIn this study, enhanced regional fibrinolysis in the lower extremities could not be detected with the use of EPCs, as measured with tPA and PAI-1 activity in common femoral venous blood samples. EPC devices do not appear to prevent DVT with fibrinolytic enhancement; effective and safe prophylaxis is provided only when the devices are used in a manner that reduces lower extremity venous stasis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of P-selectin inhibition with standard anticoagulant and thrombolytic therapy in a rodent model of established deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\nRats underwent temporary inferior vena cava (IVC) ligation for 2 days to create a stasis-induced thrombosis. On day 2, the animals had the IVC ligature removed and received either recombinant P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-Ig (rPSGL-Ig; 4 mg/kg) intravenously, low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH; 450 IU/kg) subcutaneously, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; 0.5 mg/kg) intravenously, combination rPSGL-Ig plus tPA, or saline vehicle. IVC segments were harvested from rats at 4 (n = 8) and 7 (n = 3) days after treatment. All treatments were given as a single dose except for daily LMWH. Evaluation included contrast venography with computer image analysis, thrombus weight/length (mass), vein wall leukocyte counts, cytokine and tissue factor analysis with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and (ED1) monocyte immunohistochemical staining. Collagen was estimated with a quantitative assay.\nContrast venography revealed that rats with both rPSGL-Ig and tPA treatment had significantly smaller thrombi as compared with controls at day 7 (0.34 +/- 0.07 cm(2) and 0.34 +/- 0.05 cm(2) versus 0.68 +/- 0.13 cm(2); P <.05). LMWH and tPA groups had significantly decreased thrombus mass at harvest compared with controls on day 4 (0.06 +/- 0.009 g/cm and 0.08 +/- 0.01 g/cm versus 0.1 +/- 0.005 g/cm; P <.05), and rPSGL-Ig showed a similar trend (P =.072). Vein wall, but not thrombus, monocytes were more numerous in those rats receiving rPSGL-Ig versus controls at day 4 (30 +/- 4 cells/5 high power fields [HPFs] versus 19 +/- 2 cells/5 HPFs; P <.05) and at day 7 (32 +/- 2 cells/5 HPFs versus 20 +/- 3 cells/5 HPFs; P <.05). rPSGL-Ig treatment was associated with significantly reduced vein wall collagen at day 7 versus controls (1.3 +/- 0.6 pg/mg versus 3.7 +/- 0.5 pg/mg; P <.05) and a trend toward lower tissue factor levels.\nrPSGL-Ig, LMWH, and tPA showed equal DVT resolution efficacy over 7 days. However, only rPSGL-Ig was associated with a decrease in vein wall fibrosis, suggesting that purely accelerating DVT resolution may not decrease long-term vein scarring.",

    "abstract": "The indications for deep venous valvuloplasty remain controversial in patients with incompetent deep vein valves associated with primary varicose veins. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of external femoral valvuloplasty performed simultaneously with varicose vein surgery from the standpoint of venous function determined with air plethysmography.\nThirty-one limbs of 25 patients (12 men, 13 women; mean age, 56.3 years; range, 33 to 80 years) with chronic venous insufficiency caused by valvular incompetence of both deep veins and saphenous veins were studied in a prospective, nonrandomized fashion. Descending phlebography showed moderate to severe reflux of grade 3 or 4 with Herman and Kistner classifications. Clinical severity of disease was CEAP classification 2S (in six limbs), classification 3 (in three limbs), classification 4 (in 16 limbs), classification 5 (in two limbs), and classification 6 (in four limbs). We performed superficial venous surgery alone in 14 limbs (control group), which consisted of stripping or ligation of incompetent saphenous veins and ligation of all incompetent perforators. In the remaining 17 limbs (study group), we performed superficial venous surgery simultaneously with external valvuloplasty of the femoral vein with intraoperative endoscopic observation. Venous reflux of the limbs was evaluated with air plethysmographic examination before surgery and at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery in both groups.\nPreoperative venous filling index (mean +/- standard deviation) in the control and study groups was 9.4 +/- 3.8 mL/min and 8.8 +/- 3.5 mL/min, respectively (not significant), and it decreased to 7.0 +/- 3.6 mL/min (P <.01) and 2.8 +/- 1.0 mL/min (P <.01), respectively, 1 month after surgery. Postoperative index values in the study group were significantly lower than values in the control group (P <.01), and this difference continued for more than 2 years after surgery (P <.05). After a follow-up period of 12 to 37 months (average, 25 months), the venous clinical severity score was higher in the control group (3.4 +/- 1.7) than in the study group (2.1 +/- 0.3; P <.05), and the venous disability score was higher in the control group (1.4 +/- 0.6) than in the study group (0.8 +/- 0.8; P <.05).\nAlthough further follow-up study is necessary, these results point to the functional and clinical usefulness of femoral valvuloplasty performed simultaneously with varicose vein surgery in patients with moderate to severe deep venous reflux. The venous filling index obtained with air plethysmography is an excellent predictor of the clinical severity of the disease and of postoperative clinical results.",

    "abstract": "External pneumatic compression (EPC) devices prevent lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) by reducing stasis. There is a widely held belief that they also enhance endogenous fibrinolysis; however, recent studies of tissue plasminogen activator (the primary activator of fibrinolysis) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (the primary inhibitor of fibrinolysis) failed to confirm this. The hypothesis of this study was that EPC devices increase the level of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), a second activator of fibrinolysis. This was a prospective trial in which 44 subjects who underwent major abdominal surgery were randomized to receive unfractionated heparin injections, thigh-length sequential EPC devices, or both for DVT prophylaxis. Prophylaxis was begun immediately before surgical incision and continued until postoperative day 5 or discharge. Venous blood samples were collected from an antecubital vein for measurement of systemic uPA levels and from the common femoral vein for measurement of regional uPA levels. Samples were collected the day before surgery, after induction of anesthesia but before surgical incision, and on postoperative days 1, 3, and 5. uPA levels (ng/mL) were measured with an enzyme-linked immunoassay. Baseline uPA levels (0.41 to 0.56 ng/mL; P >.05, analysis of variance with repeated measures) were similar among the three groups. uPA levels did not change after surgery in systemic or regional blood samples in any group. There were no significant differences in systemic or regional uPA levels in the groups treated with EPC devices relative to those treated with heparin at any time point (P >.05, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Enhancement of fibrinolysis with EPC devices remains unproven; the findings reported here suggest that effective DVT prophylaxis can only be assured when the devices are used in a manner that reduces venous stasis.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to define the incidence of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) after endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Because aortic endograft placement requires prolonged femoral vessel instrumentation, it may be hypothesized that these patients are at increased risk for development of an acute DVT.\nFifty consecutive patients (42 men, eight women) ranging in age from 48 to 85 years (mean, 72 years) underwent endovascular treatment of an AAA from January 2000 to August 2001. Clinical examination and bilateral lower extremity duplex ultrasonography for DVT were performed on the first postoperative day and at the 1-month follow-up visit. No patient had a prior DVT or identifiable hypercoagulable state. Seven patients (14%) had concurrent malignant disease. Preoperative antiplatelet agents were administered in 26 patients (52%), and nine (18%) were on warfarin sodium therapy before surgery. No new DVT prophylaxis was initiated perioperatively. Epidural anesthesia was used in 60% of the patients, with general endotracheal anesthesia used in the remainder. Risk factors for DVT were evaluated with univariate statistical analysis.\nThree patients (6%) had an acute postoperative DVT develop. Two occurred in the femoral veins, and one occurred in the popliteal vein. Of these patients, one had been continued on perioperative anticoagulation therapy, and the remaining two were started on low-molecular weight heparin and warfarin sodium therapy on recognition of the DVT. One patient had an intraoperative injury of the affected common femoral vein, and this individual was the only one to have clinical signs of a DVT. The mean follow-up period was 8 +/- 0.8 months. In this experience, factors that may have placed patients at increased risk for an acute DVT were not identified.\nSix percent of patients undergoing endovascular repair of AAAs had postoperative DVT develop. These patients had a number of risk factors for the development of a DVT; however, no specific factor was identified that predisposed to DVT.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to report our experience with percutaneous recanalization of totally occluded iliac veins and inferior vena cava.\nRecanalization of the iliac vein was performed in 38 limbs. In nine limbs, recanalization of the inferior vena cava was also necessary (two with filter). In 28 of 38 limbs, the stent was extended below the groin crease into the common femoral vein segment. Large-caliber (14 or 16 mm for iliac vein) flexible self-expanding stents were used. Stents were routinely extended for a short distance into the inferior vena cava to forestall development of iliocaval stenosis. Intravascular ultrasound scan was a valuable tool in the procedure. The median length of the recanalized segment was long (22 cm), and multiple stents (median, n = 3) were necessary in most patients. Forty-five percent of the patients had coagulation abnormalities.\nNo morbidity or mortality was seen. Actuarial primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency rates of the stents at 24 months were 49%, 62%, and 76%, respectively. Median pain level decreased significantly (level 4 to level 0; P <.0001) after stent placement, and more than two thirds of the patients became totally pain free after the procedure. Swelling also improved significantly, and a third of the patients became totally free of any swelling after stent placement. Sixty-six percent of cases with stasis ulcers/dermatitis (n = 14) were resolved (actuarial, 1 year), although uncorrected reflux persisted in many of these limbs.\nPercutaneous recanalization of the occluded iliac vein with stent placement appears to be successful in the short term, with good patency, significant symptom resolution, and minimal morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Superficial venous surgery for CEAP 2 disease leads to an improvement in disease-specific quality of life (QoL) in the short term. However, which factors influence the magnitude of this improvement, how surgery affects QoL in patients with CEAP 4 to 6 disease, and whether this improvement is durable are not known. The objective of this study was to identify patient, operative, and surgeon factors that might influence the change in disease-specific QoL in the 2 years after superficial venous surgery.\nThis prospective study was comprised of 203 unselected, consecutive patients with CEAP 2 to 6 disease who underwent saphenous with or without subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery and who completed the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Symptoms Severity Score (AVVSSS) before surgery and at 4 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years after surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.\nAt baseline, recurrent and ulcer (CEAP 5 and 6) diseases were associated with a higher (worse) AVVSSS. Surgery was associated with a significant improvement in median (interquartile range [IQR]) AVVSSS: baseline, 17.8 (11.8 to 27.2); 4 weeks, 13.8 (7.9 to 21.3); 6 months, 9.6 (4.2 to 15.8); and 2 years, 8.1 (4.0 to 14.7). One hundred seventy-five patients (86%) at 6 months and 177 patients (87%) at 2 years reported an improvement in AVVSSS. Postoperative AVVSSS at both 6 months and 2 years was most significantly influenced by preoperative score (P <.0001). After adjustment for baseline AVVSSS, the following factors were identified in multivariate analysis as having a significant and independent positive (+) or negative (-) impact on AVVSSS: at 6 months, (-) recurrent disease (P =.009), (-) CEAP 4 disease (P =.026); and at 2 years, (+) long saphenous surgery (P =.02), (-) CEAP 5 disease (P =.030).\nIn this unselected series, saphenous surgery with or without subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery led to an improvement in disease-specific QoL in 87% of patients out to 2 years. Although univariate analysis results suggested that many baseline factors might be associated with outcome, multivariate analysis results suggested that only surgery for recurrent disease and for CEAP 4/5 disease remained as significant negative, and only long saphenous surgery as significant positive, independent prognostic factors. These data provide evidence of the medium-term clinical effectiveness of venous surgery across the full spectrum of CEAP clinical grades, show the importance of multivariate analysis, and reemphasize the importance of minimization of recurrence.",

    "abstract": "The pelvic venous syndromes comprise a group of poorly understood disorders of the pelvic and gonadal venous circulation. The objective of this paper was to review our experience with the pelvic venous syndromes and, in the light of the current literature, make management recommendations.\nFifty-seven female patients (age range, 24 to 48 years; mean, 34 years) with symptoms of pelvic pain, dysuria, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and the presence of vulval and pelvic varices were studied. Diagnosis included physical examination, Doppler scan, duplex ultrasound scan, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and retrograde cinevideoangiography. The symptoms were classified as: 1, mild (n = 15); 2, moderately severe (n = 19); and 3, severe (n = 23). Group 1 was treated with sclerotherapy/local excision of vulval varices. Group 2 had gonadal vein resection (GVR; n = 12) and sclerotherapy or gonadal vein coil embolization (GVE; n = 7) and sclerotherapy. Only the incompetent side was treated. Patients in group 3 with isolated hypogastric vein tributary reflux were treated either with hypogastric vein tributaries division (HVTD) or with embolization (HVTE) as the only procedure. Those with combined gonadal and hypogastric vein reflux were treated with HVTE followed by GVR. The follow-up period ranged from 2.5 to 24 years (mean GVR/HVTD, 12.4 years; mean GVE/HVTE, 2.3 years). Pain improvement was assessed with a visual analog scale and through mailed questionnaires (response rate, 100%). Patient results were classified as excellent (asymptomatic), moderate (mild discomfort), or no improvement.\nIn group 1, 12 patients had excellent results and three had moderate results. In group 2, 10 patients treated with GVR had excellent results, one had moderate results, and one had no improvement. Three patients treated with GVE were asymptomatic, and four had no improvement. In group 3, three patients treated with HVTD were asymptomatic and two had no improvement. Five patients treated with HVTE were asymptomatic, and one had no improvement. Of the 12 patients treated with HVTE and GVR, 10 were asymptomatic, one had moderate results, and one had no improvement.\nLocal excision of vulval varices and sclerotherapy were sufficient in patients with mild symptoms. Gonadal vein excision produced better results than GVE. In patients with isolated hypogastric vein reflux, embolization was a better option than surgical treatment. GVR preceded by embolization of the incompetent tributaries of the internal iliac vein was indicated in patients with combined reflux and severe symptoms. Supplemental sclerotherapy of vulval varices is recommended after control of the intrapelvic reflux.",

Patients undergoing lower extremity venous ultrasound scan for suspected pulmonary embolism or already on anticoagulant therapy were excluded from the study. Data were analyzed to assess the optimal combination of characteristics to include and exclude proximal DVT.\nOne hundred fifty-six outpatients met inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. Elevated levels of D-dimer of 0.5 ng/mL or more were noted in 21 of 22 patients diagnosed with DVT, yielding a sensitivity of 95% and negative predictive value of 99%. Subjective symptoms of swelling or pain were present in 94% of all outpatients. Asymmetric calf swelling of more than 2.0 cm was noted in 14 of 22 patients (64%) with proximal DVT compared with 22 of 134 patients (16%) without DVT (P <.003). No single clinical history variable was significant on multivariate analysis. All outpatients with proximal DVT had either leg swelling of more than 2 cm or a positive D-dimer.\nA combination of a second-generation quantitative D-dimer and calf measurement provides an easy and effective means of excluding proximal DVT when screening outpatients. Patients with calf circumference 2.0 cm or less and a negative D-dimer may undergo nonemergent DU.

    "abstract": "The achievement and maintenance of access sites for hemodialysis is a persistent challenge for both the vascular surgeon and the clinical nephrologist. The advent of improved interventional, endovascular, and pharmacomechanical techniques for the treatment of thrombosis has raised questions as to whether surgical thrombectomy is the most effective treatment.\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the role of surgical thrombectomy as the standard of care for the patient with end-stage renal disease and a thrombosed/stenosed arteriovenous graft (AVG).\nThe study was designed as a metaanalysis. All publications that directly or indirectly described randomized controlled trials for the treatment of thrombosed dialysis grafts in patients with end-stage renal disease and AVG were searched. Relative risk (RR) and risk difference were used as the measure of effect for each dichotomous outcome. All of the studies that met the inclusion criteria were limited to prosthetic AVGs.\nThe overall results suggested a clear superiority of surgery over endovascular procedures at 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, and 1 year. The RRs (95% CI) at these time points were 1.32 (1.07, 1.60), 1.34 (1.13, 1.58), 1.22 (1.05, 1.40), and 1.22 (1.07, 140), respectively, and favored surgery in all cases (30 days, P =.010; 60 days, P =.0007; 90 days, P =.007; and 1 year P =.003). The number needed to treat to prevent one endovascular occlusion after thrombectomy was 8 at 30 days, 6 at 60 days, 8 at 90 days, and 7 at 1 year. The rates of technical failure were significantly greater in the endovascular group compared with the surgical group (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.32, 2.73; P =.0005), which generated an absolute risk reduction of 16% (P =.0002). No significant difference was seen in the complication rates between the two groups.\nThe analysis of all currently available randomized controlled trials clearly supports the use of surgical thrombectomy for the treatment of thrombosed prosthetic vascular access grafts. The use of endovascular techniques has been found to be inferior to surgery in terms of both primary patency and technical failure rates.",

The rates of technical failure were significantly greater in the endovascular group compared with the surgical group (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.32, 2.73; P =.0005), which generated an absolute risk reduction of 16% (P =.0002).

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the hemodynamic effects of thigh compression in patients with deep venous incompetence.\nThis diagnostic test study was set in a municipal general hospital. Twelve patients with venous leg ulcers (CEAP classification, C6 Es Ad Pr; four men and eight women), with a mean age of 56.5 +/- 16.8 years, with popliteal venous reflux of more than 1 second detected with duplex scan, underwent investigation with the following methods: 1, the pressure exerted under thigh-length compression stockings class II and short-stretch adhesive compression bandages was measured with an MST tester (Salzmann, Switzerland) and a CCS 1000 device (Juzo, Germany), respectively; 2, the great saphenous vein and the femoral vein on the thigh were compressed with a pneumatic cuff (0, 20, 40, and 60 mm Hg) containing a window through which the diameters of these veins could be measured with duplex ultrasonography; and 3, with the same thigh-cuff occlusion procedure, the venous filling index (VFI) for each experiment was measured with air plethysmography. These values reflected the presence and extent of venous reflux in each experiment depending on the degree of venous narrowing.\nThe mean pressure of a class II compression stocking was about 15 mm Hg at the thigh level, and adhesive bandages achieved a pressure of more than 40 mm Hg in the same location. A statistically significant reduction of the diameters of the great saphenous vein and the femoral vein could be obtained only when the cuff pressure on the thigh was equal to or higher than 40 mm Hg (P <.001). A reduction of the venous reflux (VFI) was achieved only with a thigh pressure of 60 mm Hg (P <.001). No significant reduction was seen of VFI with a thigh pressure in the range of the class II stockings. Previous investigations have shown that, in patients with deep venous incompetence, a pressure cuff on the thigh with 60 to 80 mm Hg is able to reduce ambulatory venous hypertension.\nThigh compression as exerted with class II thigh-length compression stockings is not able to significantly reduce venous diameter or venous reflux. However, with a pressure of 40 to 60 mm Hg on the thigh that can be achieved with strongly applied short-stretch bandages, considerable hemodynamic improvement, including reduced venous reflux, can be obtained in patients with severe stages of chronic venous insufficiency from deep vein incompetence. The practical value of these preliminary findings should be investigated with further clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical and hemodynamic outcomes after isolated first-time calf deep venous thrombosis (cDVT).\nThis retrospective clinical study was set in an academic referral center. From 1990 to 1994, 617 patients were seen with acute DVT. This number included 82 patients with phlebographically confirmed cDVT. Of those patients, 50 attended the clinical assessment 6 to 10 years (mean, 8.4 years) after the acute event. All patients with cDVT underwent treatment with anticoagulant therapy (96% heparin and warfarin, 4% only warfarin). The duration of the heparin treatment was 4.0 to 8.0 days (mean, 6.4 days), and warfarin was given for 2.0 to 7.5 months (mean, 3.4 months). Compression stockings were used regularly (mean, 9.2 months; range, 0.25 to 64 months) in 30% of the patients after acute cDVT. The initial ipsilateral phlebograms were reevaluated to confirm the diagnosis of cDVT without popliteal involvement. The clinical assessment included evaluation of both legs according to CEAP clinical classification C0-6. Bilateral color-flow duplex scan imaging was performed to assess reflux in deep popliteal segments. Photoplethysmographic measurement of venous refilling time was conducted in both legs to observe deep reflux.\nThe mean age was 57 years (range, 30 to 76 years) at the time of the clinical assessment. Cause of acute cDVT was idiopathy in 52%, coagulopathy in 2%, trauma in 10%, immobilization in 22%, and postoperative in 14% of the cases. During the follow-up period, seven recurrent DVTs (14%) were seen. In the clinical assessment, 17 legs (34%) with previous cDVT had skin changes (CEAP C4-6). No active ulcers were found. Contralaterally, the frequency of C4-6 was 10% (n = 5; P <.05). After exclusion of recurrent DVTs, the distribution of the clinical classification still remained the same. Deep popliteal reflux was detected in 20 legs (40%) with previous cDVT. Contralaterally, popliteal reflux was seen in nine cases (18%; P <.05). Plethysmography showed deep reflux in 16 legs (33%) with cDVT and in nine cases (18%) contralaterally (P >.05). A significant association was found between deep popliteal reflux and skin changes (P <.05).\nIn the long-term follow-up, cDVT may lead to significant postthrombotic disease. Reflux in the primarily uninvolved popliteal vein is frequent and may be associated with more severe disease.",

Graft infections were established in the back subcutaneous tissue of rats with implantation of 1-cm(2) sterile Dacron grafts followed by topical inoculation with 2 x 10(7) colony-forming units of S epidermidis. The study for each staphylococcal strain included: one control group (no graft contamination), one contaminated group that did not receive any antibiotic prophylaxis, one contaminated group that received temporin A-soaked graft, two contaminated groups that received perioperative intraperitoneal cefazolin (30 mg/kg) or vancomycin hydrochloride prophylaxis (10 mg/kg), and two contaminated groups that received temporin A-soaked graft and perioperative intraperitoneal cefazolin (30 mg/kg) or vancomycin hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) prophylaxis. All grafts were explanted at 7 days after implantation. The main outcome measure was quantification of bacterial contamination.\nOverall, the perioperative prophylaxis based on soaked grafts was not significantly different to that of parenteral vancomycin hydrochloride. Only the combination between temporin A and vancomycin hydrochloride produced a complete bacterial inhibition for both strains.\nTemporin A showed a similar antibacterial in vitro activity against the two different strains. The in vivo results suggest its potential use in providing prophylaxis to direct graft contamination when used in combination with parenteral vancomycin hydrochloride.",

The vascular section database was queried for patients who needed secondary procedures after the original EAR. The mean time from EAR to the termination of the study was 27.0 +/- 16.7 months. Type I or III endoleaks were treated aggressively. Type II endoleaks were treated only in the presence of aneurysm expansion.\nThirty-five (35/179; 19.6%) secondary procedures were performed in 32 patients. Indications for secondary procedures included 14 limb occlusions or stenoses (40.0%), 13 endoleaks (37.1%), six endograft migrations (17.1%), one delayed aneurysm rupture (2.8%), and one device malfunction (2.8%). Seven of the 10 early (<90 days) limb failures (70%) occurred within the first 60 patients. At that time, a protocol with aggressive external iliac artery evaluation was adopted. In the next 125 patients, the rate of early limb occlusion or stenosis was 2.4% (P =.025, with Fisher exact test). Distribution of secondary procedures included 23 endoluminal interventions (65.7%; angioplasty +/- stent placement, thrombolysis, endocuff placement, embolization), eight traditional peripheral procedures (22.9%; femoral-femoral bypass, thrombectomy), two laparoscopic interventions (5.7%; inferior mesenteric artery ligation), and two laparotomies (5.7%; delayed conversions). Interventions for limb occlusion or stenosis occurred earliest (3.5 +/- 5.4 months; P <.05, with analysis of variance), followed by treatment of endoleaks (14.3 +/- 12.9 months) and migration (27.5 +/- 10.4 months). The one delayed rupture occurred at 15.3 months.\nSecondary procedures after EAR are common. Reinterventions can be grouped temporally on the basis of indication.

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis that is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular mortality and significant limitation in function because of limb ischemia. Patients with PAD should be considered to have significant coronary and cerebral arterial disease that requires aggressive risk factor management, including the prescription of antiplatelet drugs, to lower the subsequent risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. In the population with PAD, level 1 and level 2 evidence supports the use of statin drugs for lipid management, angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 inhibitors for blood pressure control, and aspirin or clopidogrel as antiplatelet agents. Once this is accomplished, the severity of limb symptoms should be assessed, and a structured exercise program or the selected use of drugs such as cilostazol to treat claudication should be prescribed. In patients primarily considered for surgical treatment, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drug therapy can be used as a means of promoting graft patency, and beta-adrenergic blockers can be used as a means of reducing the perioperative risks associated with vascular surgery.",

The operative procedure consisted of the following steps: laparoscopic exposure of the aorta, clipping of lumbar arteries and of the inferior mesenteric artery, incision of the sac of the aneurysm without clamping the aorta, and removal of thrombus material. Laparoscopic sutures were placed externally to attach the endograft to the aortic neck. Laparoscopy was performed a mean interval of 20.2 months after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in four cases and immediately after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm exclusion in eight consecutive patients. We have yet to prove whether this combined approach is superior to a purely endovascular technique.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular techniques with coil embolization have been used in certain visceral aneurysm cases, often resulting in sacrifice of the involved visceral vessel and end-organ thrombosis. We describe two cases in which stent grafts were used to treat these aneurysms, allowing preservation of visceral artery and end-organ flow while completely excluding the aneurysm. Case 1 was a 50-year-old morbidly obese woman with a history of multiple abdominal operations for renal cell carcinoma who was found to have a large splenic artery aneurysm. A 12-mm x 50-mm Wallgraft endoprosthesis (Boston Scientific, Watertown, Mass) was placed across the aneurysm from a femoral approach. The aneurysm was completely excluded, and splenic artery flow was preserved. A subsequent computed tomographic scan showed complete aneurysm exclusion and preserved flow to the spleen. Case 2 was a 73-year-old man with hypertension with back pain who was found with computed tomographic scan to have an 8-cm hepatic artery aneurysm. Arteriography showed a large saccular aneurysm arising from the mid portion of the common hepatic artery. Two 5-mm x 26-mm Jostent stent grafts (Jomed, Alpharetta, Ga) were placed across the aneurysm neck, completely excluding the aneurysm and preserving hepatic artery flow. The patient became pain free, and subsequent duplex ultrasound scan showed a thrombosed aneurysm with normal hepatic artery flow. Stent graft techniques show early promise as a safe and effective treatment of visceral artery aneurysms in selected patients at high risk. Endografts, unlike coil embolization, exclude the aneurysm and preserve end organ perfusion. Determining the durability of this type of therapy will require further study.",

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that baboon grafts subjected to elevated shear stress exhibit an increase in luminal area through atrophy of the neointimal layer. This study was designed to investigate the smooth muscle cell (SMC) growth kinetics during early regression and evaluate the influence of nitric oxide (NO) in the regulation of this process.\nSixteen baboons underwent bilateral polytetrafluorethylene aortoiliac graft placement. After development of a neointima over an 8-week period, blood flow through one graft was increased with placement of a downstream arteriovenous fistula. Grafts were harvested at 4 (n = 6), 7 (n = 5), and 14 (n = 5) days and assessed for neointimal cross-sectional area, SMC proliferation and apoptosis, and macrophage infiltration. High-flow grafts were compared with contralateral normal-flow controls. Eleven baboons underwent an identical experimental preparation to evaluate the effect of NO inhibition. Eight weeks after graft implantation, the animals were treated with an initial bolus (100 mg/kg) followed by continuous infusion (60 mg/kg/d) of either N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; n = 6) or the inactive stereoisomer N(G)-nitro-D-arginine methyl ester (n = 5). Grafts were harvested at 7 days and evaluated with the experimental endpoints detailed previously.\nDistal fistula placement resulted in a 3.8-fold increase in mean centerline velocity and wall shear stress. Grafts harvested during the initial 14 days after flow manipulation showed a progressive reduction in neointimal cross-sectional area. This change was associated with a decrease in subendothelial SMC proliferation and an increase in neointimal SMC apoptosis, the latter being in the region adjacent to the graft. Animals treated with L-NAME showed a 20% reduction in platelet cyclic guanosine monophosphate and a 17% reduction in serum nitrate/nitrite concentrations. Despite this inhibition of NO production, no effect on the flow-dependent changes in neointimal area, cell proliferation, or apoptosis was observed in the L-NAME-treated baboons.\nThe local hemodynamic environment within healing prosthetic grafts modulates neointimal SMC proliferation and apoptosis. An increase in graft flow leads to atrophy of the neointima.",

    "abstract": "One of the most life-threatening vascular diseases is rupture of an abdominal aneurysm. The conventional treatment is based on surgical reconstruction. An alternative treatment is endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Despite many advantages, one of the problems of EVAR is endoleakage from deficient healing between the aortic neck and the fabric of the endograft. We hypothesize that better healing, achieved with induction of vascular cell ingrowth into the graft material, would lead to better graft healing.\nBoth pig aorta and human normal and aneurysmal aortic wall were used for organ cultures. Various growth factors were evaluated for the potential to induce intimal hyperplasia (ie, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF]). After the most potent growth factor had been selected, a vascular prosthetic material (Dacron fabric) impregnated with collagen and heparin was incubated with this growth factor. Impregnated pieces of Dacron were fixated on top of the aortic organ cultures for study of ingrowth of the neointima formation into the graft material.\nbFGF was the most potent growth factor to induce neointima in aortic organ cultures. The pieces of impregnated Dacron had a release of 5 ng/24 h of bFGF for a period of at least 28 days. With fixation on top of the aortic organ cultures, the impregnated Dacron was capable of inducing neointima formation and ingrowth of the neointima into the graft material after 28 days.\nWe showed that a Dacron prosthesis impregnated with collagen, heparin, and bFGF is capable of inducing graft healing in our in vitro model, the aortic organ cultures of pig and human aortas. These results suggest that the problem of endoleakage with EVAR may be solved with a perfect proximal healing between the aortic wall and the prosthesis.",

    "abstract": "Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a pathologic event characterized by tissue damage. It is mediated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and other cytokines that activate complement and proteases and stimulate fibrinolysis, degranulation of white blood cells, and free radical production. We recently reported that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) suppresses endotoxin-induced cytokine synthesis through alpha bungarotoxin-sensitive cholinergic receptors. VNS protects against endotoxin-induced shock by inhibiting hepatic and cardiac synthesis of TNF. Here, the effects of VNS on suppression of ischemia-reperfusion injury and cytokine release were studied in a rat model of aortic occlusion.\nAdult male Lewis rats were subjected to laparotomy and suprarenal aortic clamping for 15 minutes followed by reperfusion. Blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate were recorded every 3 minutes for 90 minutes. Exposed cervical vagus nerves in the experimental group were stimulated for 5 minutes before and after aortic occlusion, with constant voltage (1 V, 2 ms, 5 Hz); sham-operated animals received no stimulation. TNF levels in serum and organs were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA (BioSource International, Camarillo, Calif). Data analysis was performed with the Student t test.\nControl animals had shock develop (mean, 59% decrease in blood pressure) whereas blood pressure in the stimulated animals did not decrease (control versus stimulated animals, P <.05). VNS significantly inhibited TNF levels in serum (7 +/- 1 ng/mL versus 45 +/- 6 ng/mL; P =.0008), heart (21 +/- 11 ng/g protein versus 85 +/- 15 ng/g protein; P =.01), and liver (16 +/- 2 ng/g protein versus 42 +/- 12 ng/g protein; P =.02).\nVNS significantly attenuates TNF synthesis and shock during reperfusion injury in a standard model of aortic occlusion. Clinical evaluation of VNS for this condition may be warranted.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the preoperative and intraoperative diameter-reflux relationship of PVs and to evaluate the accuracy of preoperative duplex scanning in patients with varicose vein.\nPatients with primary varicose veins were retrospectively investigated. Diameters and reflux of PVs were evaluated before surgery with color flow duplex ultrasound scan (US). During operation, the incompetent PVs were defined as those that showed an outward spurt of blood flow from the stump of the PVs. The sensitivity and specificity of US in the detection of reflux of PVs were calculated. Competent versus incompetent vein diameters were compared with the Student t test and one-way analysis of variance.\nThree hundred twenty-four calf PVs were detected in 304 legs of 175 patients with varicose vein. Diameters of competent and incompetent PVs confirmed with intraoperative finding averaged 2.67 +/- 1.10 mm (n = 28) and 3.28 +/- 1.01 mm (n = 58), respectively, at the upper calf (P =.012), 2.85 +/- 0.85 mm (n = 53) and 3.68 +/- 0.94 mm (n = 137), respectively, at the lower calf (p <.001), and 2.67 +/- 0.99 mm (n = 14) and 3.27 +/- 0.66 mm (n = 22), respectively, at the posterior calf (P =.036). The overall sensitivity of detection of reflux with US was 87.7%, and the specificity was 75.3%.

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of intraoperative high-dose fibrinolytic therapy for extended DVT, which was performed with the regional hyperthermic fibrinolytic perfusion (RHFP) technique.\nFrom January 1993 to June 2001, in 53 patients with extended DVT, unsuccessful venous thrombectomy (recanalization, <50%) was followed by RHFP with 0.5 mg/kg of body weight of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. The extent of thrombosis was documented before, during (after the surgical thrombectomy), and after (between postoperative days 2 and 5) surgery with phlebography and was quantified with the Marder score. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded prospectively.\nAfter RHFP, a recanalization was achieved in 64 of 146 venous segments (43.8%) that were still occluded despite thrombectomy. Eighty-two segments (56.2%) remained occluded. Compared with the preoperative phlebography, 32 patients (60.3%) had a successful recanalization (>50%).

    "abstract": "We prospectively investigated the patency of venous repair in a quantitative fashion with measurement of vein blood flow velocities after lower extremity injuries caused by either military or civilian trauma.\nDuring a 10-year study period (March 1990 to December 2000), surgical intervention was performed after lower extremity vascular injuries in 130 patients. Most of these patients were men (n = 125), with a mean age of 23 +/- 5 years (range, 17 to 44 years). One hundred ten direct venous injuries were identified in 97 patients, involving the common femoral vein in seven, the deep femoral vein in three, the superficial femoral vein in nine, the popliteal vein in 46, and the posterior tibial (n = 21), anterior tibial (n = 17), or peroneal veins (n = 7) in 45. Popliteal vein thrombosis without apparent venous injury was found in seven patients. Bone fractures (n = 45), nerve injuries (n = 27), or extensive tissue loss (n = 7) often were associated with vascular injuries. Duplex color ultrasonography was used to evaluate patency and to measure blood flow velocity in repaired veins during the early postoperative period and at the time of late follow-up examinations.\nSignificant differences were seen in venous blood flow velocities between severe (extremity diameter more than twice normal) and moderate (diameter 1.5 to 2 times normal) reperfusion injuries. The mean flow velocity in repaired popliteal veins was 15 +/- 2 cm/s with severe reperfusion injuries compared with 8.4 +/- 1.1 cm/s with moderate reperfusion injuries (P <.0001). Flow velocities were lower than 5 cm/s in repaired infrapopliteal veins, and most of these veins occluded on the first postoperative day. Amputations were necessary in 11 patients, all of whom had both tibial fractures and extensive tissue loss. Sodium warfarin therapy was routinely administrated before hospital discharge. The mean follow-up period was 6.2 years (range, 1.3 to 10 years). Repaired common femoral and superficial femoral veins had relatively high patency rates (100% and 89% at 1 year, 100% and 78% at 6 years, respectively), whereas the patency rates for repaired popliteal veins were disappointing (86% at 1 year, 60% at 6 years). All seven popliteal veins that required thrombectomy in the absence of direct injuries remained patent, however. Patch angioplasty had the highest 6-year patency rate (75%) in comparison with all other techniques that were used for venous injuries (lateral repair, 58%; end-to-end anastomosis, 43%; saphenous vein graft interposition, 36%).\nVenous repair has a high patency rate at the femoral and popliteal levels, but the patency rate for infrapopliteal venous repair is extremely poor because of low flow velocities. Therefore, we conclude that repair of infrapopliteal venous injuries is unnecessary.",

    "results": "Significant differences were seen in venous blood flow velocities between severe (extremity diameter more than twice normal) and moderate (diameter 1.5 to 2 times normal) reperfusion injuries. The mean flow velocity in repaired popliteal veins was 15 +/- 2 cm/s with severe reperfusion injuries compared with 8.4 +/- 1.1 cm/s with moderate reperfusion injuries (P <.0001). Flow velocities were lower than 5 cm/s in repaired infrapopliteal veins, and most of these veins occluded on the first postoperative day. Amputations were necessary in 11 patients, all of whom had both tibial fractures and extensive tissue loss. Sodium warfarin therapy was routinely administrated before hospital discharge. The mean follow-up period was 6.2 years (range, 1.3 to 10 years). Repaired common femoral and superficial femoral veins had relatively high patency rates (100% and 89% at 1 year, 100% and 78% at 6 years, respectively), whereas the patency rates for repaired popliteal veins were disappointing (86% at 1 year, 60% at 6 years). All seven popliteal veins that required thrombectomy in the absence of direct injuries remained patent, however. Patch angioplasty had the highest 6-year patency rate (75%) in comparison with all other techniques that were used for venous injuries (lateral repair, 58%; end-to-end anastomosis, 43%; saphenous vein graft interposition, 36%).",

    "abstract": "The most common site of venous reflux is the long saphenous vein (LSV). The preferred treatment for reflux in the LSV is surgical stripping of the LSV. However, the complications of surgical stripping are well documented and undesirable. The constant search for treatment options with less morbidity, which are also cosmetically more acceptable, has resulted in the endovenous treatment for primary varicose veins, developed by VNUS Medical Technologies, Inc (Sunnyvale, Calif). We hereby present our first treatment experiences and propose refinements to the procedure.\nTwo types of heat-generating endovenous catheters were used to treat incompetence of the LSV with a diameter of up to 12 mm. The procedure was performed on a blood-empty limb.\nTwenty-six limbs, in 26 patients, were treated, and the follow-up period was 1 year. The mean preoperative CEAP score was 4, and the postoperative score was 1.26, which was statistically significantly less (P <.0001, with Wilcoxon nonparametric matched pair test). Five patients had postoperative paresthesia of the saphenous nerve, and one patient had a burn from the procedure. The overall complication rate was 23%. All complications occurred in the first half of the studied population (P =.015, with Fisher exact test), indicating the learning curve effect. In one patient (3.8%), was total recanalization of the treated segment occurred, one patient (3.8%) could not be treated at all (technical failure), and one patient (3.8%) had partial recanalization of the LSV. Eight patients (30.8%) had closure of the entire LSV but with persisting reflux in the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ). Two patients had a competent SFJ with occlusion of the LSV. In 13 patients (50%), closure of both the LSV and the SFJ was seen. The LSV was successfully occluded in 88% of the patients.\nThe endovenous catheter should not be used more than 5 to 10 cm below the knee to prevent saphenous nerve damage. Performance of the procedure with bloodlessness is preferable. A result of 88% of successfully treated LSV segments indicates a promising alternative for surgical stripping of the LSV.",

    "abstract": "Three genetic mutations have been associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events: factor V Leiden R506Q, prothrombin G20210A, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T (MTHFR) mutations. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of these mutations on patency of peripheral bypass procedures and preoperative and postoperative thromboembolic events.\nTwo hundred forty-four randomly selected volunteers participating in the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study #362 were tested for factor V Leiden, prothrombin, or MTHFR mutations with polymerase chain reaction. Patients enrolled in the study were randomized to receive aspirin therapy or aspirin and warfarin therapy after a peripheral bypass procedure. The frequencies of preoperative and postoperative thromboembolic events and primary patency (PP), assisted primary patency (APP), and secondary patency (SP) rates were compared among carriers of the various mutations.\nFourteen patients (5.7%) were heterozygous for the factor V Leiden mutation, seven (2.9%) were heterozygous for the prothrombin mutation, and 108 (44.6%) were heterozygous and 15 (6.2%) homozygous for the MTHFR mutation. After surgery, patients homozygous for the MTHFR gene mutation had increased graft thrombosis, compared with patients who were heterozygous (33.3% versus 11.1%; P =.01), and lower PP, APP and SP rates (P <.05). Furthermore, patients heterozygous for the MTHFR mutation had fewer graft thromboses (11.1% versus 24.4%; P =.01), fewer below-knee amputations (0.9% versus 7.6%; P =.02), and higher PP, APP, and SP rates (PP, 79.6%; APP, 88.9%; SP, 90.7%; P <.05) compared with wild-type control subjects (PP, 63%; APP, 75.6%; SP, 76.5%; P <.05).\nPatients with either factor V Leiden or prothrombin mutations were not at an increased risk for postoperative graft occlusion or thromboembolic events. Patients heterozygous for MTHFR mutation had a lower risk of graft thrombosis and higher graft patency rates compared with both homozygous and wild-type control subjects. Patients homozygous for the MTHFR mutation had lower graft patency rates compared with patients who were heterozygous, and a trend was seen toward lower patency rates compared with wild-type control subjects. Therefore, screening for the MTHFR gene mutation before surgery may identify patients at an increased risk of graft thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic lesions of the aortic arch are potential sources of arterial embolism. Here we investigate whether surgery, with the necessary circulatory supports, can be proposed as a good option for treatment of this problem. Study of these lesions on a national scale in France has made possible the assessment for future indications of techniques and results of the surgical management of aortic arch lesions, which retrospectively proved to be embolic.\nThirty-eight patients, (19 men and 19 women) underwent surgery between 1976 and 1996 in 17 French cardiovascular surgical centers. The average age at the time of surgery was 49 +/- 12 years (range, 31 to 82 years). Atherosclerotic lesions were detected with transesophagial echocardiography (n = 19), angiography of the aortic arch (n = 16), computed tomography (n = 9), and magnetic resonance imaging (n = 10). Surgery consisted of thrombectomy and endarterectomy (n = 22), aortic resection and graft replacement (n = 10), and patch aortoplasty (n = 5; one thrombus disappeared spontaneously before surgery was performed).\nThe average postoperative period was 30 months (range, 3 to 82 months). Contact was lost with four patients after a follow-up period of 12 months. On pathologic specimens obtained at surgery, an atherosclerotic plaque was found in 73% of the cases (n = 28). In 15% of the cases, the aorta appeared normal (n = 6) and four other types of lesion were identified: angiosarcoma (n = 1), ectasia at the insertion of the remains of the ductus arteriosus (n = 1), rupture of tunica intima (n = 1), and a fibroblastic plaque (n = 1). A thrombus was identified in 26 cases, attached to the arterial wall in 18 cases. When transesophagial echocardiographic results showed mobile lesions (n = 22), histopathologic examination of specimens allowed the detection of a thrombus in 18 cases and an atherosclerotic plaque with a mobile projection in four cases. The postoperative mortality rate was 2.6%. The morbidity rate (28.9%; n = 11) was related to neurologic complications (n = 6), vascular complications (n = 4), and infection (n = 1). Four cases (12%) were reoperated.\nNonaneurysmal aortic arch lesions are a frequent and still underestimated source of stroke and peripheral embolization. Surgery with circulatory support can be recommended in good operative candidates with recurrent critical events despite medical management and with high embolic potential (young patients with no calcified plaques).",

    "abstract": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) for treatment of carotid stenosis has not received wide acceptance because of the availability of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with its excellent results and because of the risk of embolic stroke associated with CAS. The feasibility and efficacy of cerebral protection devices that may prevent such embolic complications have yet to be shown. We report our initial results with CAS performed with cerebral protection.\nFor a period of 28 months, 31 patients with carotid artery stenosis, most of whom were considered at high risk for CEA (87%), underwent treatment with CAS in conjunction with either the PercuSurge GuardWire (n = 19; Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn), the Cordis Angioguard filter (n = 7; Cordis, Warren, NJ), or the ArteriA Parodi Anti-embolization catheter (n = 4; ArteriA, San Francisco, Calif) with US Food and Drug Administration-approved investigational device exemptions. Factors that made CEA high risk included restenosis after CEA (n = 6), hostile neck (n = 6), high or low lesions (n = 4), and severe comorbid medical conditions (n = 11). Preoperative neurologic symptoms were present in 58%, and the mean stenosis was 85% +/- 12%. Data were prospectively recorded and analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. Neurologic evaluation was performed before and after CAS by a protocol neurologist.\nCAS was performed with local anesthesia with the Wallstent (n = 23; Boston Scientific Corp, Natick, Mass) or the PRECISE carotid stent (n = 7; Cordis) in conjunction with one of the protection devices in an operating room with a mobile C-arm. Each patient received dual antiplatelet therapy before surgery. The overall technical success rate was 97% (30/31). In one patient, the lesion could not be crossed with a guidewire because of a severely stenosed and tortuous lesion. This patient was not a candidate for CEA and was treated conservatively. In the remaining 30 cases, CAS had a good angiographic result (residual stenosis, <10%). All patients tolerated the protection device well, and no intraprocedural neurologic complications occurred. Macroscopic embolic particles were recovered from each case. One patient (3%) with a severely tortuous vessel had a major stroke immediately after CAS, and no deaths occurred. The combined 30 day stroke/death rate was 3%. During a mean follow-up period of 17 months, one subacute occlusion of the stent occurred but did not result in a stroke. Three other patients had duplex scan-proven in-stent restenosis, and two underwent treatment with repeat percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with a good result. No patient had a stroke during the follow-up period.\nCAS with cerebral protection devices can be performed safely with a high technical success rate. Although many patients who underwent treatment with CAS were at high risk, the neurologic complication rate was low and CAS appears to be an acceptable treatment option for select patients at high risk for CEA. Tight lesions and tortuous anatomy may make the use of distal protection devices difficult. Further study is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Twenty-five years ago, the senior author showed a 55% postoperative ulcer recurrence rate after open perforator ligation. Those data contributed to a nihilistic attitude toward incompetent perforating veins. Conversely, since the introduction of subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS), we have undertaken ablation of superficial and perforator reflux as initial treatment in patients with ulcers (C6) or healed ulcers (C5). This report outlines our long-term results.\nBetween December 1994 and November 1999, SEPS was performed on 51 limbs in 45 patients with C5/C6 disease. Sixteen limbs underwent SEPS alone, and 35 had additional surgery on the greater saphenous vein (GSV), the lesser saphenous vein, or the tributary varicies. Data were collected according to the reporting standards in venous disease. Preoperative duplex scan of deep, superficial, and perforating veins was performed. Data were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method, Mantel-Cox log-rank test, or t test.\nOf the 51 limbs that underwent SEPS, the GSV was stripped in 28. Twenty-nine were C6, and 22 were C5. Etiology was primary (Ep) in 25 limbs and secondary (Es) in 26 limbs. All limbs had duplex scan evidence of perforator incompetence (Ap), and deep insufficiency (A(D)) was seen in 39 cases (76%).

This study reports another mechanism.\nOver a 20-year period, 4123 patients underwent lower extremity arteriography for limb ischemia. For a variety of reasons, 451 patients had repeat arteriography.\nFive patients were identified as having conclusive arteriographic evidence of spontaneous recanalization of occluded arterial segments without having undergone any surgical or thrombolytic interventions. Repeat contrast arteriography was performed on these patients for failing grafts (n = 2) or contralateral lower extremity ischemia (n = 3). Three other patients had magnetic resonance arteriographic or duplex arteriographic evidence of spontaneous arterial recanalization. Spontaneous recanalizaton occurred in ileofemoral (n = 2), superficial femoral (n = 2), popliteal (n = 3), and peroneal (n = 1) arterial segments. The average time interval of occlusion to recanalization was 21 weeks (2 weeks to 2 years). Two of the eight patients had failed revascularization procedures before spontaneous recanalization. All eight patients had restoration of pulses distal to the recanalized segments and significant symptomatic improvement as defined with the Society for Vascular Surgery/American Association for Vascular Surgery categories for limb ischemia.\nSpontaneous recanalization of arterial segments can occur and must be considered when evaluating other proposed treatments of critical limb ischemia, including cilostazol, lytic agents, and angiogenic agents, such as vascular endothelial growth factor. Although its true incidence is unknown, this represents another mechanism for spontaneous symptomatic improvement without treatment in patients with severe limb ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Temporal arteritis (TA) is frequently diagnosed with nonspecific clinical characteristics, followed by a temporal artery biopsy to confirm the presence of vasculitis. Consequently, numerous screening surgical biopsies are performed with a high negative-biopsy rate. A prospective study was performed evaluating color duplex ultrasound scan (CDU) as the preferred method for the diagnosis of vasculitis in the evaluation of suspected TA.\nThirty-two patients with suspected TA on the basis of clinical criteria were evaluated with CDU before a temporal artery biopsy. The presence of a hypoechoic \"halo,\" suggesting edema of the inflamed vessel, and inflammatory stenoses were noted. Histologic examinations of standard temporal artery biopsies then were performed, and the results were compared with the CDU findings. In addition, a metaanalysis was performed to identify articles related to the use of ultrasound scan in the detection of TA.\nAll patients completed a bilateral CDU examination of the temporal arteries, and in 75% of patients biopsied, no evidence of vasculitis was found at histologic examination. When CDU examined for halo alone as the determinant for disease, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV), compared with histologic confirmation of TA, were 85.7%, 92.0%, 75.0%, and 95.8%, respectively. With the criteria for a halo sign present, an inflammatory stenosis present, or both present on CDU, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and NPV were 100%, 80.0%, 58.3%, and 100%, respectively.\nCDU is a superior noninvasive method of determining the presence of vasculitis when compared with routine surgical biopsy. Examination of the temporal artery with CDU can effectively predict which patient will need surgical biopsy. The utility of CDU in the diagnosis of TA is maintained by a high sensitivity in detecting patients with the disease and also by a high NPV that can eliminate patients who would not benefit from biopsy.",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether this information has influenced practice patterns in New York state.\nThe database of the Center for Medical Consumers was queried to determine the volume distribution among surgeons and hospitals of all CEAs performed in New York state in 1999 and 2000.\nDuring 1999, 695 surgeons in 169 hospitals performed 9458 CEAs (mean, 13.6 per surgeon).

    "abstract": "When abdominal aortic aneurysms and common iliac artery (CIA) aneurysms undergo concomitant endovascular repair, endograft limb extension into the external iliac artery is often necessary. Usually, the internal iliac artery (IIA) is coil embolized in such a case to prevent endoleak. It has been our practice to coil embolize the IIA only in cases where there is not adequate stent graft seal in the CIA immediately proximal to the IIA origin (effectively sealing the entire IIA origin). In this study, we evaluated the outcomes of this approach.\nWe retrospectively reviewed 204 consecutive endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center from 1996 to 2001. Computed tomographic angiography with three-dimensional reconstruction was the primary preoperative imaging modality, and the decision to cover the IIA without concomitant coil embolization was based before surgery on the presence of adequate graft oversizing (> or =10% to 15%) in the most distal 5 mm of CIA and 15 mm of proximal external iliac artery, respectively.\nThe IIA was occluded 33 times in 31 patients. In 22 cases (67%), the IIA was covered without coil embolization (COVER group). The remaining 11 patients (33%) with inadequate graft oversizing in the CIA underwent IIA coil embolization (COIL group). The follow-up periods for the COVER and COIL groups were 19 +/- 2 months and 10 +/- 3 months, respectively. All operations in both groups were technically successful without evidence of endoleak at completion angiography. No endoleaks, graft migrations, or aneurysm enlargements were associated with the covered or coiled IIAs during the follow-up period. No clinical sequelae were seen in the COVER group, with the exception of buttock claudication in six patients (27%) that resolved completely in five patients. In the COIL group, five patients (45%) had buttock claudication. In addition, one case of buttock necrosis and one case of ischemic neuropathy occurred in the COIL group.\nCovering the IIA without coiling effectively excluded the CIA aneurysm in every case and was associated with a low incidence rate of complications compared with coil embolization. With detailed preoperative imaging and patient selection, IIA coil embolization may not be necessary in as many as two thirds of patients who need IIA occlusion.",

No endoleaks, graft migrations, or aneurysm enlargements were associated with the covered or coiled IIAs during the follow-up period. No clinical sequelae were seen in the COVER group, with the exception of buttock claudication in six patients (27%) that resolved completely in five patients. In the COIL group, five patients (45%) had buttock claudication. In addition, one case of buttock necrosis and one case of ischemic neuropathy occurred in the COIL group.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) and type B aortic dissections (ADs) are relatively frequent, serious conditions that are often managed nonoperatively because of perceived poor outcome of standard surgical reconstruction. Recently developed stent graft techniques represent a more attractive, less invasive option. We sought to determine the technical feasibility and safety of endovascular repair in the thoracic aorta with a retrospective review of our experience with such an approach.\nForty-seven patients received thoracic stent graft implants during the 4-year period ending March 31, 2002. All patients signed an Institutional Review Board-approved informed consent. Thirty-one patients had TAAs, and 16 had ADs. Device design and implant strategy were on the basis of evaluation of morphology with angiography and computed tomographic scan. The procedures were done with fluoroscopic guidance, with local anesthesia in five cases, spinal anesthesia in 19 cases, and general anesthesia in 23 cases. Endovascular access was achieved with femoral cutdown in 41 cases and a temporary iliac conduit in six cases. A Talent patient-specific device, with 4-mm to 6-mm oversize, was used in all. Proximal endograft attachment was in the descending thoracic aorta in 16 cases, parasubclavian in 21 cases, and the suprasubclavian aorta in 10 cases. Eight patients had adjunctive cervical reconstruction to transpose or revascularize the left subclavian or left common carotid arteries, enabling more proximal endograft attachment in the aortic arch.\nAccess failure occurred in one patient (2.1%). One patient (2.1%) died within 30 days of access-related iliac artery rupture. Another death occurred at 60 days from a ruptured thoracoabdominal aneurysm with type I endoleak. No instances of paraplegia, stroke, or surgical conversion were seen. Five patients (TAA) were found to have endoleak on 30-day computed tomographic scan. Repair of type I endoleak was undertaken in three cases at 1, 4, and 6 months. Eight patients (17%) had adverse events within the first 30 days. Length of follow-up ranged from 1 to 44 months, with a mean of 18 months. Two patients were lost to follow-up, and one withdrew from the study. Four additional mortalities were observed, none related to the endograft or aortic pathology.\nStent graft repair of TAA and AD is feasible and can be achieved with technical success and relatively low rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality. The Talent customized design proved versatile in various morphologies. More information is needed on indications, clinical efficacy, and long-term results.",

    "abstract": "Although endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (ENDO) has decreased operative morbidity risks compared with open AAA repair (OPEN), risks of rupture and reintervention are higher after ENDO. We used decision analysis to examine the effect of these competing risks on quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) after ENDO and OPEN.\nWe used a Markov decision-analysis model to simulate hypothetic cohorts of patients undergoing ENDO or OPEN. Patients moved through a multistate transition model according to probabilities derived from the literature, the EUROSTAR database (for ENDO) and Medicare claims data (for OPEN). Our primary outcome measure was QALE after surgery. We used sensitivity analysis to determine which factors most influenced this outcome.\nIn the base-case analysis of 70-year-old men, life expectancy after ENDO was 7.09 quality-adjusted life years compared with 7.03 quality-adjusted life years for OPEN, a difference of 3 weeks. Sensitivity analysis showed that at less than age 64 years, OPEN results in greater QALE. However, the difference in QALE was small (<3 months) across the entire range of ages studied (60 to 85 years). The optimal strategy was sensitive to changes in ENDO and OPEN operative mortality rate, rupture rate after ENDO, late conversion to OPEN rate, ENDO revision rate, and OPEN reoperation rate. However, the difference between OPEN and ENDO strategies was small across the plausible range of most of these variables.\nFor most patients who are candidates for AAA repair, ENDO and OPEN result in similar QALE. Decision analysis suggests that OPEN may be preferred for younger patients with low operative risk and ENDO may be preferred for older patients with higher operative risk. However, given the similarity in overall outcome, patient preference should be weighed heavily in decision making.",

    "abstract": "The increasing use of aortic endografts predictably will add to the complexity of open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair and, therefore, the proportion of surgically treated infrarenal AAAs that are juxtarenal in location (JRA) will grow. This study reviews a single-center experience with JRAs.\nBetween June 1994 and December 2000, 138 patients underwent elective repair of a JRA, comprising 16.1% of 859 consecutive asymptomatic and intact symptomatic nonruptured infrarenal AAAs repaired over the same period. All patients with JRA needed proximal suprarenal clamping (SRC) or supravisceral (SVC) clamping. Patient demographics, selected risk factors, and operative details were recorded. Univariate analyses of selected risk factors for an adverse perioperative event were assessed, and multivariate analyses were performed with linear and logistic regression with backwards selection.\nSRC was used in 95 patients (69%), and 43 patients (31%) underwent SVC. The mortality rate was 5.1% (7/138) for JRA repair, and 2.8% (20/720) for infrarenal AAA repair (P =.03). The mortality rate was significantly greater for those patients who received SVC compared with SRC (11.6% versus 2.1%; P =.02). Multivariate analysis identified SVC position as the only independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 6.1; 95% CI, 1.1 to 32.9; P =.035). Transient renal insufficiency occurred in 39 patients (28.3%), but only eight patients (5.8%) needed dialysis. Patients who had SVC had a significantly greater rate of renal insufficiency than those who received SRC (41.9% versus 22.1%; P =.02). Multivariate analysis showed SVC position (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4 to 7.8; P =.008), diabetes (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.1 to 12.9; P =.04), and preoperative renal insufficiency (OR, 5.8; 95% CI, 2.2 to 15.4; P <.001) were independent predictors of postoperative renal insufficiency. Renal ischemia during proximal clamping cannot alone explain renal complications because clamp time was shorter in patients with SVC (24.9 +/- 2.4 minutes versus 32.2 +/- 1.5 minutes; P =.009).\nJRA repair can be accomplished with a low mortality rate, but a more proximal clamp position may adversely affect outcome in these patients. Postoperative renal insufficiency is related to diabetes, preoperative renal insufficiency, and SVC position. These results suggest SRC is safer than SVC for proximal aortic clamp control of JRAs. Although clamp level must be tailored to patient anatomy, outcome may be improved if the clamp level can be kept distal to the superior mesenteric artery origin.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic luminal narrowing is caused by plaque growth and arterial remodeling. In peripheral arteries, a role for constrictive remodeling in luminal narrowing has been recognized, but the impact on lumen decrease has not yet been assessed. We studied to what extent arterial remodeling and plaque formation contribute to luminal narrowing in the superficial femoral artery.\nElderly subjects (n = 79) were studied. Post mortem, pressure-fixed femoral arteries (n = 125) were dissected and divided into 0.5-cm segments (n = 3266). In each cross section, we measured lumen area, plaque area, and the area encompassed by the internal elastic lamina (IEL area). For each artery, the cross section with the least amount of plaque was considered the reference segment. In cross sections with a decrease in lumen area compared with the reference, we determined the contributions of both plaque increase and IEL area change.\nA decrease in lumen area was found in 2193 cross sections. In cross sections with >50% lumen stenosis, plaque increase (accompanied by IEL area increase) fully explained lumen decrease in 80 of 280 cross sections (29%). In the remaining 200 of 280 cross sections (71%), both plaque increase and IEL area decrease contributed to lumen stenosis. In 57 of 280 cross sections (20%), IEL area decrease was the major determinant of lumen decrease, dominating over plaque increase. In 143 of 280 cross sections (51%), plaque increase was the major determinant, dominating over IEL area decrease.\nThe results of this post mortem study suggest that in a substantial part (20%) of severely stenotic lesions in the femoral artery, constrictive remodeling, not plaque size, is the major determinant of lumen decrease. Further serial studies are needed to confirm these results.",

In 57 of 280 cross sections (20%), IEL area decrease was the major determinant of lumen decrease, dominating over plaque increase. In 143 of 280 cross sections (51%), plaque increase was the major determinant, dominating over IEL area decrease.",
